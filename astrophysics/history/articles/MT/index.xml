      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/the-oldest-surviving-planetary-ritual-of-the-hindus/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain white Indologists and their Japanese imitators have often held the dishonest view that Hindus were unaware of planets until the yavana-s informed them of their existence in the sky. This view was demolished by the great patriot of the Hindu nation Lokamanya Tilak about a century ago. In fact he showed that the proto-Indo-Europeans&#xA;(leaving out the Hittites) certainly knew of the brightest planet in the&#xA;sky. Of course this is encoded in the form the venas recitation with the shukra and manthin graha-s. But a question still remains: Does any relatively early vedic rite specifically directed at the planets exist and survive. One example of this graheShTi of the kaTha yajurvedin-s:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the character flaws of the later day H was the loss of interest in comets. Early H astronomers in contrast had considerable interest in comets. nArada had a weird theory that all comets were the same one reappearing again &amp;amp; again. Not sure if this was some vague knowledge of Halley&amp;rsquo;s comet or just a strange theory. This comet does seem to have a greenish hue; hence, the old H would have called it an agni-putra-ketu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rajāmsi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth foot (प॒रो-र॑जसे॒ ऽसाव॒द् ओ३म् ॥) of the Sāvitrī implies that Savitṛ shines from beyond the rajas. What is this rajas, or more precisely the rajāmsi, since the Veda knows of a plurality of them. Vāmadeva Gautama says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;js_include&#34; url=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/jyotiSham/vedAH_Rk/shAkalam/saMhitA/vishvAsa-prastutiH/04/053/05_trirantarixaM_savitA.md&#34;  newLevelForH1=&#34;5&#34; includeTitle=&#34;false&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;js_include&#34; url=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/jyotiSham/vedAH_Rk/shAkalam/saMhitA/sarvASh_TIkAH/04/053/05_trirantarixaM_savitA.md&#34;  newLevelForH1=&#34;5&#34; includeTitle=&#34;false&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there is a clear emphasis on the tripartation in this mantra, the multiplicity of realms of the old Hindu cosmography is evident here. The rajāmsi are clearly distinct from the atmospheric realm (antarikṣa) and the realms of light (rocana).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
