## Rgveda
- Via S kAk: r̥gveda 10.136.2 speaks of the stars of the Ursa Major (the Seven Sages) having ropes of wind. (munayo vāta raśanāḥ). 
- Via S kAk: ŚB 4.1.5.16 describes the sun as puṣkaramādityo, “the lotus of the sky”. ŚB 8.7.3.10 says :  tudasāvāditya imūmlokūnt sūtre samāvayate, tad yat tat sūtram vāyuh .... The sun strings these worlds (the earth, the planets, the atmosphere] to himself on a thread. This thread is the same as the wind .....

## sUryasiddhAnta
- Via S kAk: Surya Siddhānta (SS) seems to remember this pre-epicyclic astronomy of the earlier period. The uccas and the node (pāta) are thus described in SS 2.1-5: "Forms of time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodaic, called the sīghrocca, mandocca, and node (pāta), are causes of the motion of the planets. The planets, attached to these points by cords of air, are drawn away by them, with the right and left hand, forward or backward, according to nearness, toward their own place. A wind, called pravaha, impels them toward their own ucсas, being drawn away forward and backward."
