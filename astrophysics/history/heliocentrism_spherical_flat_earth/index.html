Aitreya Brāhmaṇa 2.7 1kBCE or older “The (sun) never really sets or rises. In that they think of him “He is setting”, having reached the end of the day, he inverts himself; thus he makes evening below, day above. Again in that they think of him “He is rising in the morning”, having reached the end of the night he inverts himself; thus he makes day below, night above. He never sets; indeed he never sets.&#34; Subhash kAk on this passage: “One way to visualize it is to see the universe as the hollow of a sphere so that the inversion of the sun now shines the light on the world above ours. But this is impossible since the sun does move across the sky during the day and if the sun doesn’t set or rise it doesn’t move either. Clearly, the idea of “inversion” denotes nothing but a movement of the earth.&#34; shatapatha-brAhmaNa 1k BCE ŚB 4.1.5.16 describes the sun as puṣkaramādityo, “the lotus of the sky”. ŚB 8.7.3.10 says : - tudasāvāditya imāmlokānt sūtre samāvayate, tad yat tat sūtram vāyuh …. The sun strings these worlds (the earth, the planets, the atmosphere] to himself on a thread. This thread is the same as the wind ….. This suggests a central role to the sun in defining the motions of the planets and ideas such as these must have ultimately led to the theory of the śīghrocca and the mandocca cycles. sUryasiddhAnta Earth is said to be a stationary globe around which sun, moon and five planets orbit, with sun (via śīghrocca position) playing a major role in propelling the outer planets. “It calculates the earth’s diameter to be 8,000 miles (modern: 7,928 miles), diameter of moon as 2,400 miles (actual ~2,160) and the distance between moon and earth to be 258,000 miles (actual ~238,000).” “Thus everywhere on [the surface of] the terrestrial globe, people suppose their own place higher [than that of others], yet this globe is in space where there is no above nor below.” —Surya Siddhanta, XII.53 Via S kAk: Surya Siddhānta (SS) seems to remember this pre-epicyclic astronomy of the earlier period. The uccas and the node (pāta) are thus described in SS 2.1-5: “Forms of time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodaic, called the sīghrocca, mandocca, and node (pāta), are causes of the motion of the planets. The planets, attached to these points by cords of air, are drawn away by them, with the right and left hand, forward or backward, according to nearness, toward their own place. A wind, called pravaha, impels them toward their own ucсas, being drawn away forward and backward.” Aryabhata 500 AD “Aryabhata (born in 476 AD. ) appears to have held the view that the stars did not revolve round the earth, but the latter revolved round itself and gave the illustration of a man sitting in a moving boat feeling that it is the stationary objects on the banks that rush past in the opposite direction. … This was more than eleven hundred years before Galileo and there is nothing to show that Aryabhata suffered in the least for his views.”">

<li>&ldquo;The (sun) never really sets or rises. In that they think of him “He is setting&rdquo;, having reached the end of the day, he inverts himself; thus he makes evening below, day above. Again in that they think of him “He is rising in the morning”, having reached the end of the night he inverts himself; thus he makes day below, night above. He never sets; indeed he never sets.&quot;</li>
<li>Subhash kAk on this passage: &ldquo;One way to visualize it is to see the universe as the hollow of a sphere so that the inversion of the sun now shines the light on the world above ours. But this is impossible since the sun does move across the sky during the day and if the sun doesn&rsquo;t set or rise it doesn&rsquo;t move either. Clearly, the idea of “inversion&rdquo; denotes nothing but a movement of the earth.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shatapatha-brahmana-1k-bce">shatapatha-brAhmaNa 1k BCE</h2>

<li>ŚB 4.1.5.16 describes the sun as puṣkaramādityo, “the lotus of the sky”. ŚB 8.7.3.10 says :  - tudasāvāditya imāmlokānt sūtre samāvayate, tad yat tat sūtram vāyuh &hellip;.
<ul>
<li>The sun strings these worlds (the earth, the planets, the atmosphere] to himself on a thread. This thread is the same as the wind &hellip;..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This suggests a <strong>central role to the sun</strong> in defining the motions of the planets and ideas such as these must have ultimately led to the theory of the śīghrocca and the mandocca cycles.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="suryasiddhanta">sUryasiddhAnta</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earth is said to be a stationary globe around which sun, moon and five planets orbit, with sun (via śīghrocca position) playing a major role in propelling the outer planets.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It calculates the earth&rsquo;s diameter to be 8,000 miles (modern: 7,928 miles), diameter of moon as 2,400 miles (actual ~2,160) and the distance between moon and earth to be 258,000 miles (actual ~238,000).&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus everywhere on [the surface of] the terrestrial globe, people suppose their own place higher [than that of others], yet this globe is in space where there is no above nor below.&rdquo; —Surya Siddhanta, XII.53</li>
<li>Via S kAk: Surya Siddhānta (SS) seems to remember this pre-epicyclic astronomy of the earlier period. The uccas and the node (pāta) are thus described in SS 2.1-5: &ldquo;Forms of time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodaic, called the sīghrocca, mandocca, and node (pāta), are causes of the motion of the planets. The planets, attached to these points by cords of air, are drawn away by them, with the right and left hand, forward or backward, according to nearness, toward their own place. A wind, called pravaha, impels them toward their own ucсas, being drawn away forward and backward.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aryabhata-500-ad">Aryabhata 500 AD</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Aryabhata (born in 476 AD. ) appears to have held the view that the <strong>stars did not revolve round the earth, but the latter revolved round itself</strong> and gave the illustration of a man sitting in a moving boat feeling that it is the stationary objects on the banks that rush past in the opposite direction. &hellip; This was more than eleven hundred years before Galileo and there is nothing to show that Aryabhata suffered in the least for his views.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>PV Kane</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>In the words of Thurston:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Not only did Aryabhaṭa believe that the earth rotates, but there are glimmerings in his system (and other similar Indian systems) of a possible underlying theory in which the earth (and the planets) orbits the sun, rather than the sun orbiting the earth. The evidence is that the basic planetary periods are relative to the sun. For the outer planets this is not significant: both earth and sun are inside their orbits and so the time taken to go round the earth and the time taken to go round the sun are the same. The significant evidence comes from the inner planets: the period of the śīghrocca is the time taken by the planet to orbit the sun.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>S Kak -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The śīghrocca maps the motion of the planet around the sun to the corresponding set of points around the earth. This indicates a tradition of heliocentric astronomy as applied to the solar system. The sun, with its winds that hold the solar system together, is, in turn, taken to go around the earth.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Aryabhata held that earth was a sphere and rotated on its axis, and that the eclipses were not the work of Rāhu but caused by the shadow of the earth falling on the moon. Both these views were rejected and severely condemned by later astronomers like VarAhamihira and Brahmagupta.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Al Beruni&rsquo;s mis-characterization -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Al bIrUni accepts that spherical part. He (al bIrUnI) says he wrote a work arguing against a moving earth and in favor of geocentricity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="reception">Reception</h3>
<p>Later eminent scholars like Varāhamihira and Brahmagupta, who followed Āryabhaṭa, criticized his stance. Their criticsm over Āryabhaṭa scholars during 6th century CE was such a significant, leading to the rejection of Āryabhaṭa&rsquo;s theory by his own followers. They misinterpreted 2 passages and altered the reading of the text itself in the other two instances.</p>
<ol>
<li>Āryabhaṭīya Gītikā Section, Verse 6</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>शशिराशयष्ठ चक्रं तेऽशकलायोजनानि य-व-ञ-गुणाः।<br>
प्राणेनैति कलां भूः+++(<del>भं</del>)+++<br>
खयुगांशे ग्रह-जवो भवांशेऽर्कः ॥</p>
<p>Reduce the Moon&rsquo;s revolutions (in a yuga) to signs, multiplying them by 12 (lit. using the fact that there are 12 signs in a circle or revolution). Those signs mutiplied successively by 30, 60 and 10 yield degrees, minutes and yojanas, respectively. (These yojanas give the length of the circumference of the sky). The Earth rotates through (an angle of) one minute of arc in one respiration (= 4 sidereal seconds). The circumference of the sky divided by the revolutions of a planet in a yuga gives (the length of) the orbit on which the planet moves.2 The orbit of the asterisms divided by 60 gives the orbit of the Sun.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reading bham (in place of bhuḥ) adopted by the commentators is evidently incorrect. The correct reading is bhūḥ, which has been mentioned by Brahmagupta (A.D. 628), Pṛthudaka (A. D. 860) and Udayadivakara (A.D. 1073).</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Āryabhaṭīya Gola Section, Verse 9-10.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="brahmagupta-628-ce">Brahmagupta 628 CE</h2>
<ul>
<li>In his Brahmasiddhanta or Brahmasphutasiddhanta he has found fault with Aryabhata&rsquo;s
theory about the diurnal motion of the earth in the following verse :</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;प्राणेनैति कलां भूर् यदि<br>
तर्हि कुतो व्रजेत् कम् अध्वानं ।<br>
आवर्तनम् उर्व्यश् चेन्<br>
न पतन्ति समुच्छ्रयाः कस्मात् ॥&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The statement of the Earth&rsquo;s rotation through 1&rsquo; in one respiration, stated in the text, has been criticised by Brahmagupta, who says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Earth moves (revolves) through one minute of arc in one respiration, from where does it start its motion and where does it go? And, if it rotates (at the same place), why do tall lofty objects not fall down ?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="varahamihira-600ce">varAhamihira ~600CE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Pancasiddhantika (13. 6) of Varahamihira refers to this+++(AryabhaTa&rsquo;s)+++ view and rejects it, not on the ground that it is opposed to the Veda, but on the ground that, if that view were correct, hawks and other birds flying high up in the sky would not be able to come back to their nests without fail He did not know that the atmosphere also goes with the earth. &quot;</p>

<p>He tell us that if inconsistencies occur in two accounts of the same story (in this case, the shape of the Earth), they are explained by saying that the two accounts took place in two different world ages (kalpas), so called kalpabheda backup.+++(5)+++</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is oneness of both creation [accounts when exam- ined] with laudable reflections. If [however] there is a difference in some place, it is to be understood through kalpabheda.</p>
<p>(76) The shapes, measures, and motions of the earth, planets, and stars given by the followers of the purāņas, which are ultimately true, are indeed for another kalpa.</p>
<p>Now, [in this present kalpa,] the [shapes, and so on of the earth, and so on] given in the treatises that give knowledge of time [i.e., jyotiḥśāstra] are to be thoroughly studied by the wise.</p></blockquote>
<p>He concludes thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(77) He who knows the variegated body of the Cosmic Being that comprises everything and is spoken about by the ancient sages<br>
attains intimate union with the Supreme Being;<br>
thus is the meaning of the words of Vedavyāsa, [the compiler of the purāṇas].</p></blockquote>

<p>The number of sidereal days is equal to 1582237500. The number of eastward revolutions of the Earth is same as the revolutions made by the stars [westwards].
This idea of the rotation of the Earth (eastwards) has been given by Sankara Variyar as perhaps a tribute to Aryabhata, who proposed the idea for the first time in the Indian tradition.</p></blockquote>

<li>appayya vs bhaTTatiri argument about heliocentricism:
<ul>
<li>Bhattatiri asked whether moon is closer to earth or the stars? Obviously moon (Since it occludes the stars).</li>
<li>It is known that certain stars rise earlier than the moon the following day (which is actually due to the true motion of the moon). Bhattathiri’s argument is: How come a far away object can have shorter period? It is logical absurdity and appayya was summarily beaten.</li>

<li>&ldquo;The Srimad-Bhagavatam’s mode of presentation is very different from the familiar modern approach. Although the Bhagavatam’s “Earth” (disk- shaped Bhu-mandala) may look unrealistic, careful study shows that the Bhagavatam uses Bhu-mandala to represent at least four reasonable and consistent models: (1) a polar- projection map of the Earth globe, (2) a map of the solar system, (3) a topographical map of south-central Asia, and (4) a map of the celestial realm of the demigods.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;He argues for the spheroid earth theory and synchronizes the calculations mentioned in the puranas with the modern calculation we have with our observations&hellip; this theory had already been challenged by other ISKCON members. One of the arguments is that in his theory he dismantles the idea of existence of plane bhumandala and reduces them to the imaginary description of the planetary orbits when seen from the geocentric reference.
