## Parallel universes
Source: [Nyāyakusumañjali.2.287]

a pūrvapakṣa made by a Yogin who said there can be different universes with humans living in them with knowledge of religion and they can travel through space & time to reach our world to instruct us...+ Udayana rejects this view on the grounds that it is extremley difficult to travel from one continent to another, even harder to travel from one planet to another. So how can you propose travel between two different universes? How hard would this be? Impossible nearly. एतेन ब्रह्माण्डान्तरसञ्चारिवर्णव्यवस्थया सम्प्रदायप्रवर्तनमपास्तम्- सञ्चारशक्तेरभावात् वर्षान्तरसञ्चरणमेव हि दुष्करम् कुतो लोकान्तरसञ्चारः? कुतस्तरां च ब्रह्माण्डान्तरगमनम्?

Nevertheless, it is interesting to see 10th century Indians speculate on the existence of other universes and alien life with the possibility of them being intelligent beings who can travel to our earth.
