## Constellations
Constellations are patterns of stars which aid in describing locations of various celestial objects. They are associated with colorful tales which motivated the ancients of various cultures - a great mnemonic (and spiritual) device!

Various stars in a constellation are often identified with greek letters - like apha centauri, alpha virginis.


>  "Starting from Tilak, it has been proposed the that dogs (Canis Major and Canis Minor), Bear, Draco, Hunter (in Hindu world moved to Canis Major on occassions); mR^iga and other constellations were known and figured distinctly from the ecliptic divisions in the form of the nakShatra-s." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/)\]

> Al-Biruni reference (in his patanjalI yogasUtra translation, commenting on siddhi-specifying sUtra "ध्रुवे तद्गतिज्ञानम्" ):  
> The Hindus tell rather ludicrous tales when speaking of the figure in which they represent this group of stars, viz. the figure of a four-footed aquatic animal, which they call Sukrara and also Siśumâra. I suppose that the latter animal is the great lizard, for in Persia it is called Susmar, which sounds much like the Indian śiśumâra. Of this kind of animals there is also an aquatic species, similar to the crocodile and the skink.

## सप्तर्षिमण्डलम्
- ऋश॑यस् स॒प्तात्रि॑श् च॒ यत्। सर्वे ऽत्रयो अ॑गस्त्य॒श्च। नक्ष॑त्रै॒श् शङ्कृ॑तो ऽवसन्। (तैत्तिरीयारण्यके १.११.२)
    - अगस्त्यः (canopus) first visible in N India around 3000-3500BC; could be seen by people living south of 34 deg N \[[YT](https://youtu.be/5R2lXuUMdoo?t=1470)\].
- the Shatapatha Brahmana , when speaking about these aforementioned Pleiades as the Wives of the Saptarishis - pointedly refers to these as the "Wives of the Bears". Perhaps in the early days, it was used to denote stars of Ursa Major, and thence later came to refer to stars in general?

## सिंहः
- "Leo being clear of the Milky Way (areNavaH panthAH) it gives a snapshot into the depth of the universe. The M 96- M 66 group are a cluster of galaxies that has 2 sub groups. The M65, M66, and NGC 3628 triplet on the 'back' thigh below theta form one group. The other is the M 95-M 96 group along the  'front' facing hind leg of the lion. Even a small telescope will show at least 5 of the Leo galaxies & are part of one of the near by galaxy groups to our own local group at ~37*10^6 light years."

## दधिक्रावा
- Pegasus. 
- From the Rgveda we may infer that dadhikra, the flying horse, probably stood for a constellation whose rising before dawn was significant to the early Arya-s. It remains as yet unclear if that was in someway associate with Pegasus. 

## यमुना
- Eridanus (The southern river; the celestial yamunA of the Hindus which leads to the path of death).

## अगस्त्यः
Canopus. Very close to the southern pole - so only rises above horizon at certain periods in history. 

### Visibility constraints
In northern hemisphere, agastya rises and sets within a short duration of time. If this happens after dark, he is visible.

### Current visibility
- Morning - Aug-Sept
- Evening - Feb-Mar

### History
- Visible from north India about 4000BCE.
- parAshara says agastya rises when sun is in hasta. So, 1300 BCE.
- Varaha Mihira says Agastya rises wher Sun is in Sign Simha, 7 degrees behind the Sign Virgo/Kanya Rashi This was correct for his time, 530 CE at Ujjain.
