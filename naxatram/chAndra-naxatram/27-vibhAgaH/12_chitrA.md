- "The star itself is one the nakṣatra-s mentioned in the RV (according to us contra white indological opinion)."
- "In the TB 1.5.1.3 Citrā is described as an additional star of the god Indra."
- "Whereas the taittirIya brAhmaNa & other traditions recognize tvaShTR^i as the god of the asterism, the other taittirIya saMhitA, assigns 3 nakShatra-s to indra at intervals of 7 centered in Antares; chitra is the first of them. This might relate to the timing of ancient aindra rituals along the early satra."
- "this constellation offers a window, with a relatively small telescope 6-10in, of both the vastness & higher order structure of the universe. 1st we can start with M 104 or the Sombrero galaxy at the border with Corvus. It is probably the brightest galaxy in our local group& has a gigantic black hole at its center. I have routinely seen it with my 50x70 binocs on good nights. Moving from the Local group we go to the upper part of Virgo. The galaxies M 100,M 49,M 58,M 59,M 60,M 61,M 84,M 85,M 86,M 87,M 88,M 89,M 90,M 91,M 98,M 99 can be seen as part of this cluster with a small telescope. This cluster with our own local group and many others forms the Virgo supercluster. A lot of what we know of the universe is from this cluster."
