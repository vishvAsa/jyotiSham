It is interesting that eclipses lunar & solar have been central to a lot of key science from the days of the ancients to until recently. The first estimates of the ratio of the moon-earth diameters by the H & yavana-s came from this. Both reached conclusion of the spherical earth & heavenly bodies from this. Planetary theory arose from eclipse observations. 

Closer to our times space-time distortion by gravity (general relativity) was tested by this. Highly ionized Fe which was thought to be a new element was also discovered from eclipse observations.

If an alien had achieved scientific intelligence but lived on a planet that lacked the eclipsing system as on earth would a proper understanding of the universe have been achieved as easily as on earth?
