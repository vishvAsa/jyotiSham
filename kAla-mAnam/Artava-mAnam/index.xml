      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some neo-(hindu)-traditionalists decry celebration of new year on Jan 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the sentiment that new year celebration should be tied to awareness of change in nature. However, it should be noted that in Vedic times, phAlgunI (roughly the same time of the year, accounting for equinoctial precession) was considered to be new year beginning. This coincides quite closely with winter solstice (uttarAyaNArambha), which is a major event in itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
