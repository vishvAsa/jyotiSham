## **Vedic chronology 1:** **Soni-lunar** **_Uttarayana,_** **beginning of Vedic New Year**

In this series of articles we will discuss the fundamental principles of Vedic system of chronology and how it is different from the principles currently used in “Hindu calendars”.  It will be made clear that well known “Hindu new year” celebrated in sidereal _Chaitra Shukla_ _pratipada_ is neither the beginning of the true Vedic year nor the beginning of _Vasanta Ritu_, according to Vedic astronomy.

This particular article in this series will clarify how Vedic system of chronology is not only well founded on natural principles, but also based on theory of correlating human life with divine parameters as exemplified by the Vedic year itself.  The starting point of the Vedic year on the first day of “Soni-lunar _Uttarayana_” is dealt in detail.

_Jyotisha_ (Chronological astronomy) is the sixth ancillary subject (_Vedanga_). The importance of _Jyotisha_ is explained by sage _Lagadha_ in _Vedanga Jyotisha_ (VJ) saying: Vedas are propounded for _Yajñas,_ _Yajñas_ are to be performed at prescribed time. Thus, he who knows _Jyotisha_ is only capable to understand _Yajñas_ in totality. (VJ 3)

People are able to easily understand the seasonal variations apparently occurring because of the movement of the sun in relation to earth, which affects all seasonal activities. However, in the Vedic tradition, it is the _Tithi_ (Lunar day) and Lunar _Nakshatra_ (Constellation in background of Moon), which are considered most important

### **1\. What is** **_Uttarayana_****?**

Because of axial tilt of Earth (angle between the rotational axis and orbital axis) and annual movement around the Sun, the seasons occur on the earth.  Every year the day when sun appears to reach the southernmost point relative to earth and again starts to come back towards the north is the beginning of _Uttarayana_ and has shortest period of daylight in Northern Hemisphere (Also referred as December solstice) and there is lengthening of daylight from that day onwards till it reaches the northernmost point. In VJ, it is explained: Increment in day light as much as _Prastha_ (ancient unit of volume) of water (in water clock or _Nadika Yantra_) and decrement in night length equal to this occurs every day in _Uttarayana_. The reverse of this i.e. decrement in day light as much as _Prastha_ of water and increment in night length equal to this occurs every day in _Dakshinayana_. Total increment/decrement of day time is of six _Muhurtas_ in one _Ayana._ (VJ 8) (This applies to particular latitude). This makes it clear that the exact winter solstice day is decided by observation of the length of the day time (other methods like measuring the length of shadow did exist as discussed in Kautaliya Arthashastra etc.) in Vedic tradition and it was not sidereal as is the case of currently celebrated _Makar Sankranti_ as the beginning of _Uttarayana_, which lags by 23 days at present from the exact winter solstice (21st December).  Though two _Shlokas_ preceding the above mentioned _Shloka_ in VJ do assign particular _Nakshatra_ to the time of winter solstice and summer solstice, the _Nakshatra_ determined by observation is stated first, which was applicable to the time of compilation of VJ and then the rule applicable for all the time for the determination of solstice is given as explained above. This is in accordance with Vedic tradition where the precession of the solstice was known. (This will be discussed in subsequent articles in this series)

### **2\. Do we find pure solar parameters used in practice in the Vedas?**

In current practice, we see zodiac based solar month e.g. _Makara Masa_, _Tula Masa_ etc. as well as _Nakshatra_ based lunar month names e.g. _Magha, Phalguna_ etc. in use. In some regions, the names of lunar months are also wrongly used for solar months based on the position of the Sun in the zodiac. The current practice has led to incorrect notions that both solar months and lunar months are of Vedic origin and the practice of beginning the year on the first solar month as also being related to Vedas. There is also a misunderstanding about the nature of the month names like _Madhu, Madhava_ etc. used in the _Samhitas_, which are mistaken as solar months and regarding the beginning of the Vedic year, which is mistakenly taken as beginning in _Madhu_ month and _Vasanta Ritu_, simply because _Madhu_ is always the first month wherever months are listed in the Vedas. So, let us first understand what the Vedic system actually says.

In the Vedas, two types of names are used for months. In _Samhitas_ we always find the names as _Madhu_, _Madhava_ etc. signifying relation to season, and in _Brahmanas_ and _Kalpasutras_ (_Shrautasutra and Grihyasutra_), the _Nakshatra_ based names e.g. _Vaishakha, Jyestha_ etc. are used, which apparently show the relationship with _Nakshatra_. The names used in _Samhitas_ are always accompanied by _Amhasaspati_, which is the name of the thirteenth month (intercalary month, which will be dealt in subsequent parts of this series). Besides this, a year is referred to have either 12 months or 13 months and each month is made up of two halves called _Ardhamasas_, which correlate with the two halves called Bright half and dark half (_Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha_ respectively), which signify them to be lunar months only. Thus, the two types of names found in the Vedas should be taken as synonymous and that is the norm in all the commentaries of the Vedas as well as other ancient texts wherever they appear. Although in VJ, in the context of giving solar parameters, the statement “There are 12 solar months/ 12 Suns” (VJ 28) is given, but nowhere in the Vedas or in the authentic _Vedangas_, including VJ itself any names of solar months given. Thus, it is easily understood from the context that the statement about solar months is only for mathematical purpose. Similarly, in Ayurveda texts like _Sushruta Samhita (Sutrasthana_ 6_/_10_)_ and all other ancient texts of Ayurveda only lunar months and _Ritus_ (seasons) based on lunar months are mentioned and used for prescribing _Ritucharya_ (seasonal healthy regimen) as well. Therefore, it is clear that Vedic months are lunar months itself and no solar months are given in the Vedas.

### **3\. What is soni-lunar** **_Uttarayana_** **and why does the Vedic year start with first day of it?**

Solar _Uttarayana_ day (winter solstice day) cannot be used as a starting point of a month or year in practice in the Vedic system, where months, seasons and year for practical purposes start from _Shukla pratipada_ (first day of bright half). In VJ, the knowledge of chronology is thus explained to encompass the _Yuga_ comprising five years starting from the first day of  bright half of the _Magha_ month (this is not sidereal _Magha_ which in vogue which will be explained in subsequent articles in this series) and ending in the _Amavasya_  or new moon day of _Pousha_ month (VJ 5).  _Magha_ is referred as first month in various Puranas as well:

“Among five years (a Vedic _Yuga_ comprises of 5 years) _Samvatsara_ is the first, among the seasons (first is) _Shishira_ and among months (first is) _Magha._” _–_Brahmanda Purana (First part 24/141) Vayu Purana (1/153/113) and Linga Purana (1/61/52)

_Adhikamasa or Malamasa_ (13th month or intercalary month) is added at appropriate intervals (only at the end of either of _Ayana_ in Vedic system) to maintain the synchronicity of lunar months with the season governed by solar position relative to earth, occurring as a result of annual movement of the earth. This implies that the Vedic _Magha_ (_Tapas_) month is always near actual winter solstice and is not sidereal. The start of Vedic year in seasonal _Magha_ (_Tapas_) is clear from the quotations above and further supported by the concept of day of _Devas_ in Vedic tradition. Seasons are obviously important in timing of _Yajñas_, some of which are based on seasonal agricultural products as well. Although the timing of festivals in current practice follows _Nirayana_ or sidereal system in contrast to Vedic season based system, Vedic seasonal practice can be seen followed in festivals like Vasanta Panchami (Sarasvati Pooja), which falls in Vedic soni-lunar Vasanta Ritu, when the current practice would call it Shishir Ritu and label the festival as Magha Shukla Panchami (1st February this year ), which is actually Madhu Shukla Panchami (Chaitra Shukla Panchami) as per Vedic seasonal system.

The reason of _Madhu_ (first lunar month of _Vasanta Ritu_) being always mentioned first in the Vedas is not related to it being first month of the Vedic year as is mistaken today. It is rather related to the order of seasons prescribed for _Agnyadhana and Samskaras_ for different _Varnas_, _Vasanta_ being prescribed for _Brahmana._

### **4\. Why is the Vedic year called as a day of** **_Devas_****?**

A year for human use is considered a day (i.e. day and night) of the Devas, _Uttarayana_ being the day and _Dakshinayana_ being the night for them. This concept is clearly stated in the Vedas as well as Smritis and Puranas:

One day of _Devas_ is a year – Taittireeya-Krishna-Yajurveda-Brahmana (3/9/22/1)

When he (Sun) is moving towards north, he is moving in Devas path and protects Devas – Shukla-Yajurveda-Shatapatha-Brahmana (2/1/3/3)

Divine day and night is a year (for human use). Day is _Uttarayana_ and night is _Dakshinayana –_ Manusmriti (1/67), Mahabharata (12/231/17). Same verse is mentioned in various _Puranas_ too.

Again, because year, _Ayana_, seasons, month all start from _Shukla pratipada_ for all practical purpose, which is clear from the discussion in previous section, the divine day and thus Vedic year, also starts from _Magha_ _Shukla_ _Pratipada_, which is mostly the _Shukla Pratipada_ falling just before the exact solar _Uttarayana_ (winter solstice day) rather than from the solar _Uttarayana_ day itself (except when _Adhikamasa_ happens, when _Magha_ _Shukla_ _Pratipada_ is pushed to fall just after solar _Uttarayana_). For example, the current Vedic year began on 30th November 2016 (22 days before the winter solstice) as it was _Shukla Pratipada_ falling just before the solstice day and next year it will begin on 18th December ( 3 days before winter solstice day).

In the next article in this series, we will discuss the practical ancient approach to identify solstice and equinox days in tropical (solar) year, which are also used in maintaining the seasonal nature of Soni-lunar calendar parameters by insertion of intercalary month (_Adhikamasa or Malamasa_) at appropriate time in Vedic system.

_Note:_ _All numbers following VJ = Vedanga Jyotisham, referred in this article refer to Shloka number in Yajurvedic version of the same._

### **Glossary**

**Solstice =** It is an astronomical event that occurs twice each year as the Sun appears to reach northernmost and southernmost points in relation to the celestial equator.

**Ayana =** Half of a year divided on the basis of apparent annual movement of the Sun.  In six months making up _Uttarayana_, starting from winter solstice day, the Sun appears moving toward North till summer solstice day, from which _Dakshinayana_ starts and the Sun comes back to southernmost point. Soni-lunar _Uttarayana_ and _Dakshinayayana_ used in Vedic calendar correspond to these points starting from _Shukla Pratipada_ falling near the winter solstice and summer solstice.

**Precession of solstice/equinox =** Shift of the background point (where the Sun appears to be) at the time of solstice/equinox. This occurs because tropical year is shorter (by about 20 minutes) than sidereal year**.  **

**Nirayana system =** System of fixing months/festivals based on position of Sun/Moon, not taking account true seasons (disregarding precession of solstice)

**Shukla Paksha =** Bright half of the lunar phase where the sunlit part increases till it is full moon day. (Poornima).

**Krishna Paksha =** Dark half of the lunar phase starting from the next day of full moon till new moon (when moon is not visible)

**Lunar month =** Duration of either of 29 or 30 days in Vedic practice ( as actual duration is about 29.5 days) also called synodic month, starting from the next day of new moon( _Shukla pratipada_) to next new moon day(_Amavasya_). (Lunar month ending on new moon known as _Amanta Masa_ is used in Vedic system)
