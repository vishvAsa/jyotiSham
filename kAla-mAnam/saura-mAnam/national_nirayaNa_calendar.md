## Intro
With effect from 14 April 2004 or from 25 Chaitra 1926 Saka Era of the National Calendar, Govt. of India introduced a uniform All-India Nirayana Solar Calendar corresponding to 1 Vaisakha, 5105 Kali Era, Kali Era being chosen as the era for this calendar. This Nirayana Calendar has fixed number of days for its month and consequently has leap years at required intervals. The intention for introducing this calendar has been that it would progressively replace the divergent regional Nirayana Solar Calendars and bring about uniformity in our traditional calendric system.

The epoch of Kali Era adopted for All-India Nirayana Calendar is midnight (IST) of 17/18 February of 3102 B.C. or -3101 A.D. of Julian calendar and the length of its year is reckoned on the basis of true length of sidereal or nirayana year.
For calendric purposes, the All-India Nirayana Calendar has been deemed to have started from 5101 Kali Era year +++(2000 AD?)+++.

## Leap years
If a Kali Era is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 4000, then that year is considered as a leap year. Accordingly Kali Era years like 5104, 5108, 5112....etc are leap years but 4000, 8000, 12000... etc. are not leap years. There are also additional leap years. If a Kali Era year becomes divisible by 150 then the subsequent year of that Kali Era year will be an additional leap year. Accordingly Kali Era years like 5101, 5251, 5401... etc. are additional leap years.
