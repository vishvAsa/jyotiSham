The Julian year of 365.25 days was longer than the true year of 365.2422 by .0078 days, so the winter solstice day which fell on December 21 in 323 A.D., fell back by 10 days in 1582 A.D. and the Christmas day appeared to be losing all connections with the winter solstice. Similar discrepancy was also noticed in connection with the observance of the Easter.\* 

\* **Easter**, the most joyous of the Christian festivals, is observed annually throughout Christendom in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, on the **first Sunday after the full-moon** following the vernal equinox day. The last days of Christ coincided with the Passover fast of the Jews and his death fell upon the day of the feast of the Passover, on the 14th day of the month of Nisan. As the date of Easter is associated with the moon's phases, as well as the vernal equinox day, it is a movable festival, falling anywhere between March 22 and April 25. A movement is going on for narrowing down the range of variation of the Easter day ; in 1928 the British Parliament passed the Easter Act, which contingent upon its acceptance internationally, fixed Easter day as the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April, falling between April 9 and 15. (Vide Encyclopaedia Britannica, Easter). 

Various proposals were made for correcting the error and the Council of Trent which assembled in 1545 authorised the Pope to deal with the matter. When in 1572, Gregory XIII became Pope, these schemes were considered and the plan that was most favoured was the one that had been proposed by **Aloysius Lilius, a Neapolitan physician**. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII published a bull instituting the revised calendar and ordained that Friday, October 5 of that year was to be counted as Friday, October 15. For the future, **centurial years that were not divisible by 400 were not to count as leap years**, in consequence the number of leap-years in 400 years was reduced from 100 to 97 and the year-length of the calendar thus became 365.2425 days, the error being only **one day in 3300 years**. 

The Gregorian reformation of the calendar was at once adopted by the Catholic states of Europe, but other Christian states took longer time to accept it. In **Great Britain** it was officially introduced in **1752**. As the error had by that time amounted to 11 days, the September of 1752 was deprived of these days and 3rd September was designated as the 14th September. In some countries the Gregorian calendar was not adopted until the present century. China and Albania adopted it in 1912, Bulgaria in 1916, Soviet Russia in 1918, Roumania and Greece in 1924 and Turkey in 1927. The rules for Easter which were revised on the basis of the Gregorian calendar have not been adopted by the Greek orthodox Church. 

Inspite of its wide use, the Christian or Gregorian calendar is a clumsy and inconvenient system of time-reckoning on account of the **arbitrary length of its months** ranging from 28 to 31. With a view to reforming it many schemes have been proposed, but the one deserving of serious consideration is the new **World Calendar** advocated originally by the Italian astronomer Armellini in 1887 and adopted by the World Calendar Association, Inc., which has its headquarters in New York (630. Fifth Avenue, New York 20, N. Y), under the able presidentship of Miss Elisabeth Achelis. 

(She had been devoting her services ungrudgingly for the CABO of calendar reform for the last twenty-five years, and also been publishing Journal of Calendar Reform' since then.)

In the ecclesiastical calendar **some holy days** are observed on **fixed days** of the year, others known as **movable festivals** are observed on **fixed days of the week**. Most of these are at **fixed intervals before or after Easter day**. When the Easter day of any year is fixed, the dates of other movable festivals can accordingly be ascertained. The **Council of Nice** convened in 325 A.D. adopted the rule for fixing the date of Easter- it was to fall on the first Sunday after the 14th day of the moon (nearly full moon) which occurs on or immediately after March 21. In fact there are certain special tables for determining the Easter day, based on the mean length of the lunar month, and the determination does not require any advance calculation of moon's position. The following are the principal holidays dependent on the date of Easter.
