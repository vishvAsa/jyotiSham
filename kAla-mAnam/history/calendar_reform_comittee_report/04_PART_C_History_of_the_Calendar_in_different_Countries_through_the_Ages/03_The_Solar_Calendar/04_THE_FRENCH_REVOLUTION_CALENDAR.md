title = "04 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION CALENDAR"

+++

The Egyptian calendar attracted the notice of the calendar committee of the French Revolutionary Government (1789-1795) who wanted to **replace Religion by Reason**. The committee consisted, amongst others, the great mathematicians **Laplace and Lagrange** and the poet d'Eglantine. Laplace proposed that the year 1250 A.D., when according to his calculations the equinoctial line was perpendicular to the apse line +++(=major axis)+++ of the Earth's orbit should be taken the starting point of the French Revolution Era in place of a hypothetical year of Christ's birth. But the calendar committee did not agree with him but started the era of the glorious French revolution, with the autumnal equinox day of 1792 A.D., as this was nearest in date to the outbreak of the revolution. Sentiment proved stronger than cold scientific reasoning.

The seven-day week was abandoned for a week of 10 days. The month names were invented by the poet member of the committe. The last five days were dedicated to the service of the poor ( Sans-Culottides ) and did not form part of any month. 

After 13 years of service, the French Revolution calendar was abolished by Napoleon Bonaparte, then emperor of France, as part of his bargain with the Roman Catholic Church for his coronation by the Pope.
