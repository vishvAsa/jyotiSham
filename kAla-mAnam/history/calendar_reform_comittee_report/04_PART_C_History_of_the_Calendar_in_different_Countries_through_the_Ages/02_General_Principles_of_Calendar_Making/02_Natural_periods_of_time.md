title = "02 Natural periods of time"

+++

The three events mentioned in (1), (2) and (3) above define the natural divisions of time. They are : 

The Day: defined by the alternation of daylight and night. 

The Month : the complete cycle of moon's changes of phase, from end of mew-moon to next end of new moon (amānta months), or end of full-moon to end of next full-moon (Pūrṇimānta months). 

The Year : and its smaller subdivisions, viz., the seasons. 

## The Days

The day, being the smallest unit, has been taken as the fundamental unit of time and the lengths of months, the year and the seasons are expressed in terms of the day as the unit. 

+++(* Day here means 'Day and Night'. In ancient times, the duration of day-light from sunrise to sunset, and of the night from sunset to sunrise, were measured separately with the aid of water clocks. It was comparatively late that the length of the Day, meaning day-light and night, was measured. It was distinguished by the term ahorātra in Sanskrit, ahna meaning daylight time, and rātri meaning night time. In Greece, this was known as Nychthemeron. )+++

But the day is to be defined. Many early riations defined the day as the time-period between sunrise to sunrise (sāvana day in India) or sunset to sunset (Babylonians and Jews). But the length of the day, so defined, when measured with even the rough chronometers of early days, was found to be variable. This is due to the fact that except at the equator, the sun does not rise or set at the same time in different seasons of the year. So gradually the practice arose of defining the day as the period from midnight to midnight, i. e., when the sun is at the nadir to its next passage through the nadir. Even then the length of the day is found to be variable when measured by an accurate chronometer. The reasons are set forth in all astronomical text books +++(also seen below regarding solar day vs siderial day)+++.

### Solar day

Then came the idea of the mean solar day, and it is now taken as the fundamental unit of time. The mean solar day is the average interval between the two successive passages of the sun over the meridian of a place +++(example overhead)+++ derived from a very large number of observations of such meridian passages. The time between two passages is measured by an accurate chronometer. 

### Siderial day

In addition to the solar day, the astronomers define also a sidereal day, which is the time period between two successive transits of a **fixed star**. +++(ie time for distant stars to appear in the same position in the sky)+++ It measures the time of rotation of the earth round its axis.

+++(† Actually speaking, the sidereal day is defined in astronomy as the period between two successive meridian passages of the First point of Aries. As this point has a slow westward motion among the fixed stars, the duration of the so called sidereal day is very slightly less than the actual sidereal day or the period of rotation of the earth.)+++ 

### Relation between the two

The solar day is larger than the sidereal day, because by the time the earth completes a rotation about its axis, the sun slips nearly a degree to the east due to the motion of the earth in its orbit, and it takes a little more time for the sun to come to the meridian of the place. We have the relation : 

- 365.25 mean solar days=366.75 sidereal days. 
- Rotation of the earth = 23h 56m 45.100 mean solar time. 
- Sidereal day = 23 56 4.091 „ „ 
- Mean solar day = 24 3 56. 555 sidereal time 

The actual sidereal day, which measures the period of rotation of the earth is generally taken to be constant. The variable part of the solar day comes from two factors : 

- (1) Obliquity of the sun's path to the equator, and 
- (2) Unequal motion of the sun in different parts of the year. .. 

(See H. Spencer Jones, General Astronomy p. 45). It has however been recently found that even the period of rotation of the earth is not constant but fluctuates both regularly and irregularly by amounts of the order of 10-6 seconds. 

## The Month

The month is essentially a lunar phenomenon, and is the time-period from completion of new moon (conjunction of moon with the sun) to the next new moon. But the length of the month so defined **varies** from 29.246 to 29.817 days, owing to the eccentricity of the moon's orbit and other causes. The **month or lunation** used in astronomy is the **mean synodic period**, which is the number of days comprised within a large number of lunations divided by the number of lunations. Its value is given by 

- 1 lunation=29.05305882–0.40000002 T where T=no. of centuries after 1900 A.D. 

The present duration of a lunation=29:5305881 days or 29d 12h 44m 2.8. There are other kinds of months derived from the moon and the sun which will be discussed later. 

## The Year and the Seasons

The year is the period taken by the seasonal characteristics to recur. The early people had but a vague notion of the length of the year in terms of the day. In the earliest mythology of most nations, the year was taken to have comprised 360 days, consisting of 12 months each of 30 days. They apparently thought that the moon's phases recur at intervals of 30 days. 

But experience soon showed that these measures of the month and the year were wrong, but they have left their stamp on history. The sexagesimal measure used in astronomy and trigonometry, as well as fanciful cycles of life of the Universe, invented by ancient nations, appear to have been inspired by these numbers. 

It appears that the Egyptians found very early (as related in the next section) from the recurrence of the Nile floods that the year had a length of 365 days. Later they found the true length to be nearer 365.25 days. 

The ancient Babylonians, or Chaldeans+++(wrong - interwebs say they're distinct)+++ as they were called from about 600 B.C., appear to have been the earliest people who tried to obtain correct measures of the time-periods: the month, the year, and the seasons in terms of the day, and its subdivisions. Their determinations were transmitted to the Greeks who refined both the notions and measurements very greatly. This story will be told in Chapter II. 

At present it is known that the length of the seasonal year (tropical year) is given by : 

- Tropical year=365'24219879--07614 (t-1900) days, where t=Gregorian year. 

The present duration of a tropical year is 365-2421955 days or 365d 56 48m 45°87. 

## The Sidereal Year 

In some countries, the ancients took the year to be the period when the sun returned to the same point in its path (the ecliptic). This is the time of revolution of the earth in its orbit round the sun. The tropical year, or the year of seasons, is the time of passage of the sun from one vernal equinox to the next vernal equinox. The two years would have been the same, if the vernal equinoctial point (hereafter called the vernal point) were fixed. But as narrated in Chapter IV, it **recedes to the west at the rate of 50" per year**. The tropical year is there fore less than the sidereal year by the time taken by the sun to traverse 50", i.e., by .014167 days or 204 246. 

For calendarical purpose, it is unmeaning to use the sidereal year (3654.256362), as then the dates would not correspond to seasons. The use of the tropical year is enjoined by the Hindu astronomical treatises like the Sūrya Siddhānta and the Pañca Siddhāntikā. But **these passages have been misunderstood**, and Indian calendar makers have been using the sidereal year with a somewhat wrong length since the fifth century A.D.
