title = "03 THE PROBLEMS OF THE CALENDAR"

+++

Whatever may be the correct lengths of the astronomical month and the year, for application to human life, the following points have to be observed in framing a civil calendar. 

- (a) The civil year and the month must have an integral number of days.
- (b) The starting day of the year, and of the month should be suitably defined. The dates must correspond strictly to seasons. 
- (c) For purposes of continuous dating, an era should be used, and it should be properly defined. 
- (d) The civil day, as distinguished from the astronomical day, should be defined for use in the calendar. 
- (e) If the lunar months have to be kept, there should be convenient devices for luni-solar adjustment. 

A correct and satisfactory solution of these problems has not yet been obtained, though in the form of hundreds of calendars which have been used by different people of the world during historical times, we have so many attempted solutions. The early calendars were based on insufficient knowledge of the duration of the natural time cycles-day, month and year-and led to gross deviations from actual facts, which had to be rectified from time to time by the intervention of dictators like Julius Caesar, Pope Gregory XIII, or a founder of religion like Mohammed, or by great monarchs like Melik Shah the Seljuk, or Akber, the great Indian emperor. 

Owing to the historical order of development, calendars have been used for the double purpose : 

- (i) of the adjustment of the civic and administrative life of the nation, 
- (ii) of the regulation of socio-religious life of the people. 

In ancient and medieval times, society, state and church were intermingled, and the same calendar served all purposes. The modern tendency is to dissociate civic life and administration from socio-religious life. Also due to the enormous growth of intercourse amongst all nations of the world, the need has been felt for a World Calendar dissociated from all religious and social bias. Owing to historical reasons, the Gregorian calendar is now used inter nationally for civic and administrative purposes, but it is very inconvenient, and proposals have been made to the U. N. O. for the adoption of a simple World Calendar (vide ยง 2.7).
