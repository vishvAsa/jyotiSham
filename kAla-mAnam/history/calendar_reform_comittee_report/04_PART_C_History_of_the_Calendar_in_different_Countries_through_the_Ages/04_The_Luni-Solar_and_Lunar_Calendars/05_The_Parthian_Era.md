title = "05 The Parthian Era"

+++
Since the introduction of the Seleucidean era, the practice arose for a nation or a dynasty to start eras commemorating some great event in their national or dynastic life. The first in record is the Parthian era, and the story of its starting is well-known. The Seleucid emperors ruled the Near East from 312 B.C. imposing on the countries under their domination Greek culture, the Seleucidean era, and the Graeco Chaldean system of time-reckoning. About 250 B.C., there were wide-spread revolts against Seleucid rule in Bactria, in Parthia (Eastern Persia), and other parts of the Near East. The revolt in Parthia was led by one Arsaces and his brother Tiridates who belonged to an Iranian tribe, which had adopted Greek culture. To commemorate their liberation from Seleucidean rule, the Parthians introduced an era, beginning **64 years after the Seleucid era (i.e. 248 B.C.)**. But at first this era (**Arsacid era**) was only rarely used. The early Parthian emperors preferred to use on their coins the Seleucidean era, the Macedonian months, and the Graeco-Chaldean system of time reckoning inscribed in Greek letters. In the **first century A.D.**, there was a **Zoroastrian revival**, the S.E. was dropped in favour of the Parthian era and Pehlevi began to be used in place of Greek, though Macedonian month-names were still kept. 

Though kings bearing Parthian names ruled at Taxila about the first century B.C. to first century A.D., e.g., king Gondophernes, no clear evidence of the use of the Parthian era on Indian soil has yet been found. 

It is very likely that the **śaka era**, with its methods of calendar-reckoning, which came into vogue in India during the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa times, was started by the **śaka tribes** when they attained prominence, and started an era of their own, in **imitation of the Parthians**. They, however, retained the Graeco Chaldean method of lunar month-reckoning and probably the same system of intercalary months.
