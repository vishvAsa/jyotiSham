EMPIRICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE YEAR AND THE MONTH 

The solar year has thus a pretty nearly constant value, but even the earliest astronomers appear to have observed, that the lunation, or the synodic period of the moon is not a constant, but is variable. As a matter of fact, the period varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days-nearly fourteen hours. The observation of the actual motion of the moon formed the most formidable problem in ancient astronomy (vide §4). 

But all ancient nations show knowledge of an astonishingly correct value of the **mean synodic period**, which is known to be **29.530588** days. This is probably because they could count the number of days with fractions comprising a very large number of lunations, and therefore the mean value came out to be very correct. 

With the aid of the knowledge of correct values of the length of the tropical year, and of the mean synodic period of the moon, it is possible to find out correct rules for luni-solar adjustment, as narrated below. But this could happen only at a later stage. The first stage was certainly empirical as is clearly indicated from a record of the great Babylonian king and law-giver **Hammurabi** (1800 B. C.), which says that the **thirteenth month** was proclaimed by royal order throughout the empire on the advice of priests. All religious observances were forbidden during this period.\* 

\* It is said that in ancient Palestine, the custom was that the **Rabbis went to the fields** and watched the time by their calendar for the ripening of wheat. If the lunar month of Addaru (last month of the year) fell back too much towards winter, they would **proclaim a second Addaru** in that year, so that the first of Nisan would coincide roughly with the ripening of wheate. 

It is not known however, what principles, if any, guided the king or rather his advisers in their selection of the thirteenth month, but most probably the adjustment was empirical, i.e.; the month was discarded when the priests found 'from actual experience that the festival was going out of season, Many ancient nations who used the luni-solar calendar, do not appear to have gone beyond the empirical stage. 

## Empirical Relations between the Solar and Lunar Periods : The Intercalary Months. 

The Chaldean astronomers (as the Babylonians were called after 600 B.C.) appear to have striven incessantly to obtain very accurate values for the mean lunation and the length of the solar: year, and work out at the discovery of mathematical relation ships between these two periods having the form-- 

m lunar months = n solar years  
where both m and n are integers. 

Let us describe some of these relations, 

The **Octaeteris** : This depends on the relation : 

- 8 tropical years = 2921.94 days
- 99 lunar months = 2923.53 days. 

The difference is only 1.59 days in 8 years. We have used here the correct lengths of the two periods. The Babylonian values were slightly different. 

According to this relation, there were to be **three extra** or intercalary **months** in a period of **8 years**, and festivals would fall approximately in the right seasons, if these three months were suitably excluded for religious observances. But the rule was only approxi mate. In a few cycles, the discrepancy would be too large to be disregarded. 

According to the celebrated exponent of Babylonian astronomy, Father Kugler, this system was in vogue from 528 B.C. to 505 B.C., then there was an interval when they used to have **10 intercalary months in a period of 27 years**. From 383 B.C., the Chaldeans used the 19-year cycle, based on the relation : 

- 19 solar years = 6939.60 days 
- 235 lunar months = 6939.69 days. 

There is a discrepancy of .09 days in 19 years, or a mistake of 1 day in 210 years. 

The **19-year cycle, with 7 intercalary months** was used throughout the whole Seleucid times (313 B.C. 75 B.C.), as shown by Pannekoek. This system has not been superseded inspite of various attempts. 

These rules came into vogue at a time (383 B.C.), when Babylon had lost her independence and became a vassal state of the Persian empire of the Acheminids. We do not know what was the original calendar of pre-Acheminid Persia, but the great Acheminid emperor Darius preferred the simpler Egyptian solar calendar to the complex luni-solar calendar of Babylon. The population of Babylon could no longer depend upon the king to adjust the dates of their religious observances by royal decree, as happened in the time of Hammurabi (1800 B.C.). Probably therefore the priest-astronomers felt the need of mathematical rules which should take the place of royal decrees.

The 'Nineteen-year cycle' is generally known as the '**Metonic Cycle**' after Meton, an Athenian astronomer who unsuccessfully tried to introduce it at Athens in 432 B.C. But there is no proof that it was used at Athens before 343 B.C. The question of ‘priority of this discovery is therefore a disputed one.
