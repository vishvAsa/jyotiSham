title = "06 THE JEWISH CALENDAR"

+++
The ancient Jewish calendar was lunar, the beginning of the month being determined by the first visibility of the lunar crescent. As the month-names show (col. 4 of the table No. 4.), they were evidently derived from the **Babylonian month-names** excepting one or two, viz., Marheshvan and Tammuz. The **day began in the evening** and probably at sunset. The year used to begin with the **spring month Abib or Nisan**, the latter being the Babylonian name of the month which was adopted by the Jews in the post-exilic times. **Intercalation** was performed, when necessary, repeating the twelfth month 'Adar' which was then known as Veadar followed by Adar. The year beginning was subsequently changed and in the last century before Christ, it became the month of Tishri, corresponding to the Macedonian month of Dios. This must have been due to the desire or need to follow the practice of the ruling race. 

Originally there were no definite rules for inter calation and for fixing up the beginning of the months. Because various religious festivals and sacrifices were fixed with reference to the beginning of the month, information about it was spread throughout the country by messengers and by signal fires on hilltops. 

About the 4th century A.D., fixed rules were introduced in the calendar and nothing was left to observation or discretion. **Intercalation is governed by a 19-year cycle** in which the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th years have got an extra month. The actual beginning of the initial month of the year, viz., Tishri is obtained from the mean new-moon by complicated rules which are designed to prevent certain solemn days from falling on inconvenient days of the week. As a result, a common year may consist of 353, 354 or 355 days and an embolismic or leap-year of 383, 384 or 385 days. Ten of the months have got fixed durations of 29 or 30 days, as well as the intercalary month which contains 30 days, the other two varying according to the requisite length of the year. 

### The Jewish Era of Creation 
The Jews use an Era (Anno Mundi, libriath olum) or 'Era of Creation' which is supposed to have been started from the day of creation of the world. We quote the following passages from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, 'Chronology, Jewish'. 

- (1) The era is supposed to begin, according to the mnemonic Beharad, at the beginning of the lunar cycle on the night between Sunday and Monday, Oct. 7, 3761 B.C., at 11 hours 115 minutes P.M. This is indicated by be beth, (two, i.e., 2nd day of week), ha (he, five, i.e., fifth hour after sunset) and Rad (Resh, dalet, 204 minims after the hour). 
- (2) In the Bible various eras occur, e.g., the Flood, the Exodus, the Earthquake in the days of King Uzziah, the regnal years of monarchs and the Babylonian exile. During the **exile** and after, Jews reckoned by the **years of the Persian kings**. Such reckonings occur not only in the Bible (e.g., Daniel viii, I) but also in the Assouan papyri. After **Alexander**, the Jews employed the **Seleucid era** (called Minyan Shetaroth, or **era of deeds**, since legal deeds were dated by this era). So great was the influence exerted by Alexander, that this era persisted in the East till the 16th century, and is **still not extinct in south Arabia**. This is the only era of antiquity that has survived. Others, which fell into disuse, were the **Maccabaean eras**, dating from the accession of each prince, and the national era (143-142 B.C.), when Jud√¶a became free under Simon. That the era described in Jubilees was other than hypothetical, is probable. Dates have also been reckoned from the fall of the second Temple (Le-Horban hab-bayyith). The equation of the eras is as follows : 

Year 1 after destruction = A.M. 3831 = 383 Seleucid = A.D. 71 

The '**Era of Creation**' is supposed to have started from the day of autumnal equinox of the year 3761 B.C. So the sun and the moon must have existed before the day of creation !!+++(5)+++
