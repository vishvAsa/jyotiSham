Translation 1. While the celestial bodies move in the sky from north to south and again from south to north, a very small variation takes place in their doolination. 

2. The (ascending) node in which the celestial equator and the ecliptic intersect is the first point of Aries (Meṣādi), and it gives the 'Esst'. Tha second node is the first point of Libra (Tuladi), and these two points never change their declination value (which is zero). . . . 

3. The first point of Cancer (Karkadi) is at a distance of three signs (i.e. 90°) from it, and at a distance of three signs in the reverse order is the position of the first point of Capricorn (Makarādi). These give the positions of maximum declination which is 24 degrees. 

4. The solstitial points (which mark the ayanas) show a movement, and the number of their revolutions in a Kalpa is counted as 199669. 

The last passage recognizes processional motion, says that it is continuous, and gives the rate as 59".9 per year. Muñjāla Bhata makes no mention of trepidation. He noticed that the Ayanas had precessed by about 6° from the position given in the Sūrya-Siddhānta. 

Pr̥thūdaka Svāmi (born 928 A.D.), an astronomer who observed at Peibowa, near Kurukṣetra, commenting on a passage of Brahmagupta says : 

"The revolution of Ayana in one Kalpa is 189411. 

This is called the Ayana Yuga". This passage recognizes the continuous nature of precessional motion, and gives the rate of precessional motion as 56".82 seconds per year. 

So far we have no mention of the 'Theory of Trepidation.' This is first mentioned in the Arya Siddhānta, ascribed to Aryabhaṭa II, whose date is 1028 A.D. It says : Ayanagrabadoh krāntijyācāpam kendravat dhanarna i syāt Ayànalavāstat samskệta khețādayana carāpamalagpāni. 12. 

Translation : -Find the sine declination (krāntijyā) of the ayanagraha (in a way similar to that of the sun's declination); from it deduce the amount of declination, plus (north) or minus (south), which is the amount of ayanāṁśa.* After applying this ayanāṁśa-correction to the planet, the values of cara (half the difference between the lengths of day and night), declination of planets, lagna (the orient ecliptic point), etc., are to be calculated. 

This has been interpreted as follows (Dikṣit, p.330). 

The equinox oscillates between #24°, and the number of rovolutions of the Ayana-planet in a Kalpa is 578159, which gives the period 8-royolution as 7472 years and the annual rate of motion as 173"4. During & quarter period viz., 1868 years, the ayananśa increases from 0° to 24°, at first, rapidly, then gradually more slowly like the increase of 

declination of the sun. Thereafter it diminishes in like manner and after the lapse of 3736 years, i.e. the half period, it again becomes zero and goes on the other side. The annual rate of motion, which on the average amounts to 46.3 seconds, varies from t 70'-5 to 0" 

Wo now come to a very controversial passage in the modern Sūrya Siddhānta, Chap. III, verses 9 to 12. 

These are : 

Trimsat kftyo yuge bhānāṁ cakram prāk parilamvate tadgunād bhūdinairbhaktāt dyaganāt yada bāpyate. 9 

Taddostrighnā daśāptāmśā vijñeyā ayanābhidhāḥ tatsamskstādgrahāt krānticchāyā caradalādikam sphutan dʻktulyatāṁ gacchedayane viguvadvaye. 10 Prāk cakram calitam hine chāyārkāt karaṇāgate antarāmsai rathāvștya pascacchegaistathādbike. 11 Evaṁ viṣuvaticchāyā svadese yā dinārdhajā daksinottara rekbāyām gā tatra viṣuvat prabhā. 12 

Translation 9. In an Age (yuga), the circle of the asterisms (bha) falls back eastward thirty score of revolutions. Of the result obtained after multiplying the sum of days (dyugana) by this number, and dividing by the number of natural days in an Age, 

10. Take the part which determines the sine, multiply it by three, and divide by ten ; thus are found the degrees called those of the precession (ayana). From the longitude of a planet as corrected by these are to be calculated the declination, shadow, ascensional difference (caradala) etc. 

11. The circle, as thus corrected, accords with its ob served place at the solstice (ayana) and at either equinox ; it has moved eastward, when the longitude of the sun, as obtain ed by calculation, is less than that derived from the shadow. 

12. By the number of degrees of the difference ; then, turning back, it has moved westward by the amount of difference, when calculated longitude is greater. 

These verses occur in the chapter on astronomical measurements by the gnomon, and are misfits there ; according to all authorities, these verses did not exist in the original Sūrya-Siddhānta, but have been extrapolated there, and have no reference to the context of the chapter. The extrapolation must, however, have taken place before the time of Bhāska rācārya II (1114-1178 A.D.), because he comments on this passage. 

The passage supports the theory of trepidation and says that the amplitude of processional oscillation is 27o and the period of one complete oscillation is stated to be 7200 years. The rate of procession is given as 54" per year, which is uniform and the same throughout the oscillation. These stanzas are quoted by Indian astrologers who are advocates of the nirayana system, in support of their arguments for sticking to the sidereal year. They say that the present ayanāṁśa is about 22°, and r. will go on precessing for another 350 years till ayanāṁśa bocomes 27o and will then turn back on its return journey.

This is sufficient argument to them to turn down all proposals for Sayana reckoning taking the length of the year to be tropical. 

We now take the opinion of the last great Indian astronomer Bhāskarācārya II (1150 A.D.). 

He uses the term 'Sampāt-Calana' i.e., movement of the intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, instead of the classical term Ayana. He says : 

Siddhānta Siromani, Goladhyāya, 

Golabandhādhikāra Tasya (viṣuvatkrāntivalayapātasya] api calanamasti. Yo'ayanacalana bhāgāḥ prasiddhāsta ova vilomagasya 

krāntipātasya bhāgāḥ Translation :--It (the equinox) 'has also movement. What is commonly known as the amount of procession (ayanām śa) is the same as the longitude of the equinoctial point measured backwards. 

This evidently shows that he regarded the change as due to the retrograde motion of the node (i.e. equinoctial point) like modern European astronomers. 

He criticises Brahmagupta for his views on Ayana Calana and says: “One can observe that at the time of Brahmagupta, the ayanāṁśa value was very small and hence it is likely that it could not have come to his notice ; yet how is it that he did not take the rate of revolution of oquinoxes as given by the Sūrya-Siddhānta, just as he has taken figures for rates in some other cases on the basis (or authority) of already proved and accepted rates". 

He further says : Ayanacalanam yaduktam Muðjālādyaiḥ sa evāyam 

(krāntipātah) tatpakṣe tadbhaganāḥ kalpe go'rgartu-nanda-go-candrāḥ 

(199669). 

Atha ca yo vā to vā bhaganāḥ bhavantu yadā yo'msa nipuṇairupa labhyante tadā sa ova krāntipātaḥ. 

Translation :-"What Muðjāla and others have mention ed as 'Ayano Calana', is nothing but the motion of this .. equinoctial point. According to their view the number of revolution in a Kalpa is 199669 (yielding annul rate of 59".9). Let whatsoever be the number of revolutions, whatever amount is obtained by expert observers is the angle of precession for that time.” 

From this it is clear that he recommends one to accept the ayandinsa which one would actually get by observation of sun's place at any particular time. Dīkṣit says : 

I have not come across single statement in which Bhāskarācārya has clearly said that equinoctial point makes a complete "circular revolution", nor does be say that "it does not make it”. 

He has taken 1 minute per year as the ayana-motion and has supposed 11° as the gyanāmśa in śaka 1105. He thus means to take Śaka 445 as the zero-precession year. 

We thus perceive that Indian astronomers up to the time of Bhāskarācārya were as much divided in their ideas about precesssion of the equinoxes as the contemporary Arab astronomers of the West (Hispano-Muslim), and the East. It is only after 1024 A.D. that they adopted a theory of trepidation. The earlier-astronomers like Muñjāla and Pșthūdaka merely noticed precession and gave their own rates for it. Bhāskarācārya is non-committal about trepidation. The Indian astronomers do not appear to have been influenced by the views of the western astronomers, the earlier Greeks or later Arabs. 

It will be sheer stupidity to hold to the theory of trepidation of equinoxes 270 years after it has been definitely proved to be wrong. The law of universal gravitation will not be changed by God Almighty to oblige astrologers.
