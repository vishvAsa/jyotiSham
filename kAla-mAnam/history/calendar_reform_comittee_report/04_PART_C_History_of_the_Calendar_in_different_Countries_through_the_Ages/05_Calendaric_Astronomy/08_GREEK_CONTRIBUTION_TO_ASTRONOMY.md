## Intro
It has been considered neccessary to give a short account of Greek contributions to astronomy, because there is a widespread view that it was Greek astronomy which formed the basis of calendar reform in India which took place about 400 A.D. ( Siddhānta Jyotiṣa calendar). Let us see how far this view is correct. The Greeks themselves appear to have made no use of astronomy for the reform of their own calendars, as was done later in India. They cultivated astronomy partly as pure science, partly as an indispensable adjunct to astrology. 

It is now well-known that Greek civilization had a long past going back to at least 1500 B.C. The remains of this civilization have been found in Crete (Minoan), and on the Greek mainland itself (Mycenean). Inscriptions have been found in strange scripts (Linear A, and B) which defied decipherment till 1952. We have therefore as yet no knowledge of the calendar in the **Mycenean age of Greece (1400 B.C.—1000 B.C.)**, but probably they will now be forthcoming. 

The **Homeric poems** 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey' written about 900 B.C., as well as **Hesiod** writing about 700 B.C. show considerable acquaintance of stars and constellations needed for sea-faring people, to find out their orientation when out at sea. 

From about 750 B.C., the Greek city-states began to emerge ; they were engaged in maritime trade over the whole Mediterranean basin. These activities brought them into contact with many older nations who had attained a high standard of civilization, e.g., the Egyptians, the nations of the Near East, vex., the Lydians, the Phoenicians, and the Assyrians and imbibed many elements of their civilization. The older Greek scholars themselves admit that the Greeks borrowed their **script\* from the Phoenicians**, their coinage from the Lydians, their preliminary ideas of **geometry from the Egyptians** and of **astronomy** from the **Chaldeans**. But they enriched all these sciences beyond measure by their own original thoughts and contributions. As Plato (428-348 B.C.) proudly remarks : "...whatever the Greeks acquire from foreigners, is turned by them into something nobler." 

+++(\* It appears that the Greeks of Homeric poems used linear A and B, but about 900 B.C., they borrowed the simpler Phoenician script and' adopted it to their use by the addition of vowels. Thereby they forgot their old script and history, which became myth and legend. The decipherment of Minoan Linear B has been achieved in 1952 by Ventris and Chadwick. )+++

## Science history
Greek science goes no further back than **Thales** of Miletus (624-548 B.C.), who is reckoned to be the **first of the seven sages** of Greece. Considerable knowledge of astronomy and physics was ascribed to him by later writers. He is supposed to have predicted the occurrence of an almost total solar eclipse, which occurred on May 28, 585 B.C., on the basis of his knowledge of the **Chaldean Saros**. These stories are now disbelieved by scholars well versed in Assyriology, for according to their finding, the Chaldeans themselves before 400 B.C., had no knowledge of the Saros of 18 years 10.5 days used later to predict the eclipses, but they used other methods with only partial success. Thales might have used one of these methods, but not certainly the Chaldean Saros. Considering the crude state of Greek civilization in Thales' times, these scholars think that it is a fairytale of modern times that Thales knew anything about the Saros. Thales lived in a coastal city of Asia Minor which had active contact with the great civilizations of the Near East, and probably much of the knowledge ascribed to him were picked up from Babylon and Egypt. 

The next figure in Greek astronomy is **Anaximander, (610-545 B.C.)**, likewise of Miletus a junior contemporary of Thales, who is said to have introduced the use of the **gnomon** ( vide 43). This may be conceded, but this practice was derived most probably from the Chaldeans, who used the gnomon from much earlier times. **Cleostratos** ( 530 B.C.) of Tenedos was cited by later authors to have introduced the knowledge of the **zodiac**, of the **eight-year cycle of intercalations** in Greece, but probably he merely transmitted the Babylonian knowledge and practice. **Meton** of Athens is said to have introduced the **nineteen-year cycle of 7 intercalary months** in Athens in 432 B.C., but as remarked earlier, its use in Greek calendars cannot be dated before 342 B.C., though it was known in Babylon from at least 383 B.C. The question of priority of this discovery is still to be decided, probably by fresh finds and interpretation of ancient astronomical records.

We have besides philosophers of the: **Pythagorian school** (500-300 B. C.), a religious brotherhood which cultivated **geometry, astronomy, physics and mathematics**. They are cited by later writers to have propagated the view that the **earth was a sphere**, and the planets were also spherical bodies like the earth, but it is difficult to state when, and on what grounds these theories were first propounded. 

These were the periods of tutelage. Greek genius in astronomy began to flower only after 400 B.C., and was aided by a number of causes. 

The first was the development of geometry as a science by philosophers of the Pythagorean school (500-300 B. C.), and other scholars, notably **Hippocrates of Chios** ( 450-430 B.C.), and **Democritos of Abdera** ( 460-370 B.C.). A great impetus to both **plane and solid geometry** was given by **Plato** ( 428 348 B.C.), famous philosopher and founder of a school of studies and research known to the world as the **Academy**. Plato counted amongst his contemporaries and juniors several geometers of distinction, vix., **Archytas** of Tarentum (first half of fourth century B.C.), **Theaitetus** of Athens (c. 380 B.C.), **Eudoxus** of Cnidos ( d. 355 B.C.), and several others. All the geometrical knowledge developed by these and other scholars was compiled, and rewritten into a. logical system with rich contributions of his own by **Euclid**, who lived in the **Museum of Alexandria** ( 280 B.C.), and was bequeathed to the world in thirteen (or fifteen ) books known as the **Elements of Euclid**, which have remained to this day the basis of the teaching of elementary geometry. There is no other book of science which have remained current and authoritative for such a long stretch of time, now extending over two thousand years. 

The second factor was political. During the sixth and fifth centuries before Christ, the Greek savants and scholars had indeed undertaken educational journeys to the Near East in search of knowledge --journeys which were made possible and safe under the orderly regime of the Acheminid empire (Persian). But it was the conquest of the Persian empire by Alexander of Macedon in 330 B.C., which rendered these contacts easier and more fruitful. The Greek successor dynasties, vix., the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, and the Seleucid dynasty in Babylon and other dynasties in Asia Minor were all great patrons of learning and encouraged and maintained scholars ; the former set up the famous Museum at Alexandria, which was a research institution with a great library, an observatory and other necessary equipment. It attracted scholars from all parts of Greater Greece and provided them with free board, lodge and a salary. This place nurtured a number of great Greek,geniuses : Euclid; already mentioned ; **Eratosthenes** who first measured correctly the diameter of the earth and was the founder of scientific chronology ; and others whom we shall meet presently. 

On the Asiatic side, under the centralized rule of the Seleucids, the later Chaldean and Greek astronomical efforts became very much intermingled. A Chaldean priest, **Berossus**, who lived during the reign of the second Seleucidean king Antiochos Soter ( 282-261 B.C. ), **translated into Greek the standard Chaldean works** on astronomy and astrology. The period from 340 B.C. to 150 A.D. may be called the most flourishing period of astronomical studies in antiquity. The Chaldeans figured prominently during the earlier part of this period but their methods were based on a **primitive form of algebra and arithmetic**. According to Neugebauer, their contributions in mathematics and astronomy were as good as those of the contemporary Greeks who used geometry, but they gradually faded into obscurity on account of their infatuation with astrology ; and the Greeks, though they were great believers in astrology, freed themselves at least from astrolatry, and cultivated astronomy as part of astrology, and emerged as leaders in astronomical science. 

The earliest Greek astronomer to use geometrical ideas in astronomy is, if we leave aside the Pythagoreans, probably **Eudoxus of Cnidos** ( d. 355 B.C.), a junior contemporary, friend and pupil of Plato. He made great original discoveries in **geometry**, and Books V and VI of Euclid are ascribed to him. It was probably his knowledge of geometry which led him to make the first scientific attempt to give a geometrical explanation for the irregular motions of the sun, the moon, and the planets. Twenty-seven spheres, all concentric to the earth were needed to account for these motions. This theory had but a short life, but it is remarkable as the first instance, when heavenly bodies, connected with great gods, were treated on a human level. 

Eudoxus is supposed to be the inventor of geometrical methods for determining the **sizes and distances of the sun and the moon**, usually ascribed to **Aristarchus of Samos** (fl. 280 B.C.), who is known to have taught that the daily revolution of the celestial sphere was due to the rotation of the earth round its axis. He is also said to have first put forward the **heliocentric theory** of the universe. Neither of these theories was accepted by the contemporary astronomers. The world had to wait for the appearance of a **Copernicus** (1473-1543), for the acceptance of these views. 

**Apollonius** of Perga (born avout 262 B.C.) known more for his treatise on Conics, originated the theory of **epicycles**, and **eccentrics** to account for planetary motion. He was a junior contemporary of two great figures : Eratosthenes already mentioned and **Archimedes of Syracuse** (287-212 B.C.), a great figure in mechanics, hydrostatics and other sciences, but to astronomy, he is remembered as originator of the idea of **Planetarium**-a revolving open sphere with internal mechanisms with which he could imitate the motions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets. 

Archimedes is also credited with attempts for finding out the actual distances of the planets from the earth. We do not know whether this is correct or not, but about this time, we find the planets arranged according to the order of their distances from the earth : 

Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn or if we take the reverse order : 

Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. This last order was taken up by astrology and formed the basis of the seven-day week, which came into vogue about the first century A.D. 

The greatest name in Greek astronomy is **Hipparchos of Nicaea**, in Bithynia who settled in the island of Rhodes and had an observatory there (f. 161-127 B.C.). He probably corresponded with the savants at the Museum of Alexandria. Not much of his writings have come down to us, except through quotations and remarks by **Claudius Ptolemy**, the famous Alexandrian astronomer who flourished three centuries later. Sarton writes about Hipparchos : 

"It is possible that all the Ptolemaic instruments, except the **mural quadant**, had already been invented by him (e.g. **diopter, parallactic and meridian instruments**). He was the first Greek observer who divided the circles of his instruments into 360 degrees. He constructed the **first celestial globe** on record. He used and probably invented the **stereographic projection**. He made an immense number of astronomical observations with amazing accuracy" 

The principle of measurement of angles was certainly derived from the Chaldeans. Hipparchos gave a catalogue of **850 stars with their positions**, which is reproduced in Ptolemy's Syntaxis. Vogt found that of the 471 preserved numbers giving position, 64 are declinations, 67 are right ascensions, 340 are in polar longitudes and latitudes, which reappear in the **Surya Siddhānta**, six hundred years later. 

It is suggested that after his discovery of **precession** (vide § 4.9 ), Hipparchos probably used celestial longitudes and latitudes. But these co-ordinates bad been already used by the Chaldeans at least a century earlier, 

Hipparchos, had probably some knowledge of **plane and spherical trigonometry** necessary for the solution of astronomical problems, e. g., finding out the **time of rise of zodiacal signs** during the year, a problem of great importance to horoscopic astrology. It is the current opinion that he used the **double chord**, illustrated below : 

Chord (2 a)=2 R Sin a 

{{< figure src="../../../images/hipparchus_double_chord.png" title="Fig. 20" class="thumbnail">}}

and gave a table of double-chords from 0° to 90°, which was later improved by Ptolemy in his Syntaxis. It is suggested by Neugebauer, that the '**Sine function**' (**Jya** in Hindu astronomy) was introduced 600 years later by **Aryabhaṭa**, and replaced the double chord. The Hindu astronomers used **Utkramajyā** which is the **ver sine** function, **1-cos a**, but do not appear to have used the cosine function as such. Neither the Greeks nor the Hindus used the **tangent, and the cotangent**, which were introduced by Arab +++(Harran Sabean)+++ astronomers about the ninth century (**al-Battāni**, 858-929 A.D.), and were known in Latin in early days as Umbra Versa, and Umbra Extensa (extent of shadow ) respectively. These are reminiscent of the practice of designating the zenith distance+++(→angle)+++ Z of the sun by the length l of the shadow of the gnomon, l=p tan Z, p being the height of the gnomon. 

Between Hipparchos and Claudius Ptolemy (150 A.D.), who lived at the Alexandrian Museum from 128 A.D. to 151 A.D., there is a gap of 300 years, which saw the phenomenal rise of horoscopic astrology. There are, however, very few great names in astronomy. **Menelaos**, a Greek astronomer who lived in Rome about 98 A.D., laid the foundation of **spherical trigonometry**, but it was confined to a transversal proposition from which Ptolemy deduced solutions for only right angled spherical triangles, of which either two sides or an angle and one side are given. The Hindu astronomers likewise used only solutions of **right angled spherical triangles**. The discovery of **general relations** in spherical triogenometry was the work of Arabic +++(Harran Sabean)+++ astronomers (**al-Battani**). 

Claudius Ptolemy who worked at Alexandria between 128-151 A.D., was, as Sarton says, a man of the Euclidean type. Great equally as an astronomer, mathematician, geographer, physicist, and chronologist, his main work is the great **mathematical and astronomical treatise** known in Greek as '**Syntaxis**', and in Arabic translation as the **Almagest**. It has been long supposed that it rendered all previous treatises in astronomy obsolete, and remained a standard text, which fertilized the brains of all ancient and medieval astronomers, Greek, Jew, Arab, and European, till the rise of the heliocentric theory of the universe rendered it obsolete. This opinion appears to have been rather exaggerated. Strangely enough, the Syntaxis appears to have been quite unknown to Hindu astronomers of the 5th century A.D. 

Ptolemy's chief contribution to astronomy was his elaborate theory of planetary motion and discovery of a second inequality in the motion of the moon, now called Evection+++(??)+++. He gave a catalogue of 1028 stars with their positions, most of which have been shown to have been taken from Hipparchos by adding 30 to the longitudes given by him. This represents the shift of the first point of Aries since Hipparchos's time according to Ptolemy's calculation. The actual value is 4°. 

Ptolemy wrote a treatise on astrology known as the “**Tetrabiblos**" which long remained the **Bible of the astrologers**. 

After Ptolemy, there were no great figure in astronomy except few commentators and workers of mediocre ability like **Theon** of Alexandria (about 370 A.D.), who initiated the false theory of **trepidation of the equinoxes**, and **Paulus** of Alexandria (fl. 378 A.D.) who wrote an astrological introduction. He is supposed to have been the inspirer of the Indian Siddhānta known as **'Paulisa' Siddhānta** (vide § 56), but this hypothesis started by Alberuni has never been proved. With the advent of Christianty, and after **murder of the learned Hypatia** (415 A.D.), the 'light' goes out of Greece. 

## Summary
The Greek contributions to astronomy are : 

- A geocentric theory of the universe, with the planets in the order given on page 203. 
- The treatment of planets as spherical bodies similar to the earth. 
- Geometrization of astronomy, development of the concepts of the equator, the ecliptic and of spherical co-ordinates (right ascension and declination, celestial latitude and longitude), some elementary know ledge of plane and spherical trigometry to deal with astronomical problems. 
- Knowledge of planetary orbits, and attempts to explain them with the aid of epicyclic theories.
