**Prasnavatara**  
**प्रश्नावरताराध्यायः**

नत्योदिगर समनल भैरवमर्द्धतमीश्वरं नृहरिम् ।  

वराहेणैया क्रियते प्रश्ने वैज्ञवल्लभारचाप। ॥१॥

Having paid obeisance to Lord Narasimha who is fierce by his form and who is ever emitting fire from face, who is one without a second, and who is the over-lord of the entire universe, Sripati (Varahamihir) is writing this work Daivajna Vallabha dealing with the science of Horary Astrology.

NOTES: It is customary among Sanskrit writers to begin every work with an auspicious verse. The purpose of this prayer is to invoke the blessings of the lord : (1) for the completion of the work un-impeded by obstacles, (2) for the work to become popular in the world in future, (3) for observing the age old custom of great men and (4) for instructing the disciples that they too should do likewise.

It is generally belived that Sripati and Varahamihir are one and the same person. Sripati was the appellation granted to Varahamihir by king Vikramaditya in his honour for his correct prediction. This view is based on legends and as such may not get much credence today. We are however tempted to identify the one with the other on the basis that it was Varahamihir who authored Brihat Jataka in horoscopy, Pancha Siddhanta in the mathematical branch of astrology and Bribat Samhita in the Samhita branch and that it is the

sage again who authored the Prasna Vallabha in the horary astrology. Those having reservations in this respect are free to hold their views.

दीप्ताद्यं दशभेदं व्योमचराणां निरूप्य भावफलम् ।  

पृष्टो यद्यत्कथयति शुभाशुभं तत्तदन्यथा नोक्तम् ॥२॥

The astrologer, who proclaims good and bad results after a deep consideration of the ten Avasthas (States) of planets and the results arising from the different houses, never goes [wrong[^1] Prasna Jnana, Sl. 2  (ii) Prasna Tantra I, Sls. 16-17").

[^1]: "cf-(i

NOTES: The Acharya will discuss the effects of planetary states at length in future chapters himself. The results of the houses have to be judged with reference to (1) the house itself; (2) the lord of the house; and (3) the significator of the house.

Vide-

भावाद्भावपतेश्च कारकवशात्तत्तत्फलं चिन्तयेत् ।

Same is the opinion of Acharya Bhattotpala and Nilakantha also. Such a conclusion arrived in this manner seldom goes wrong. In fact, all the authors are agreed on the point.

Almost all the classical writers have spoken of the avasthas or states of planets in their works and have held that these avasthas are also a source of strength for the planet to give the results. There is, however, some difference of opinion as regards the number as well as the nomenclature of avasthas. Nilakantha has stated ten avasthasnamely:Deeptha, 2. Dina, 3. Muditha, 4. Swastha, 5. Suptha, 6. Nipiditha, 7. Mushita, 8. Pariheena, 9. Swaveerya and 10. Adhiveerya.

Shri Mahadeva in Jataka Tatwa speaks of 5 avasthas in one classification which are: (1) Baala (child), 2. Kumar (boy), 3. Yuva (adult), 4. Vraddha (old) and 5. Mritaka (dead).

In another classification he details the avasthas as Shayana (lying down), 2. Upavesam (sitting), 3. Netrapani (hand on eyes), Prakasa (shining), 5. Gamana (going), 6. Aagamana (coming),

7\. Sabha (in the assembly) 8.Gama, 9. Bhojana (eating) 10. Nrityalipsa (desiring to dance), 11. Kautuka (Curiosity) and 12. Nidra (sleeping). In another classification there are 7 avasthas. They are: 1. Deeptha, 2. Swastha, 3. Hasyayukta, 4. Shanta, 5. Shakta, 6. Lupta, 7. Peeditha.

In the Sanketa Nidhi there are 12 avasthas and 3 sub-avasthas of planets. The avasthas are 12 in number. namely: 1. Shayana, 2. Upaveshana, 3. Netrapani, 4. Prakasa 5. Gamana, 6. Agamana, 7. Aasthanee, 8. Aagama, 9. Bhuji, 10. Nrityalipsa, 11. Kautuka and 12 Nidra.

In Phala

Deepika we have eleven states. They are: 1. Pradeepta, (blazing) 2. Sukhita (happy), 3. Swastha (healthy). 4. Muditha (delighted), 5. Shanta (calm), 6. Shakta (competent), 7. Vikala (distressed), 8. Nipiditha (tortured or troubled), 9. Khala (Base), 10. Sudukhita (exceedingly unhappy) 11. Ati-bheeta (very much afraid)

**Planetary States :** Diptha, (shining), Dina (miserable), Swastha (comfortable), Muditha (happy), Suptha (sleeping), Prapiditha (troubled), Mushita (robbed), Parihiyamanavirya (with power declining), Pravriddhavirya (with increased vigour), and Adhivirya (endowed with extreme power) are the ten planetary

state:

1\. When the planet is placed in its exaltation sign is called

Diptha.  

2\. When it is in its debilitation sign, it is called *Dina*  

3\. In its own sign, the planet is termed *Swastha.*  

4\. In a friendly sign, it is called *Muditha.*  

5\. In an inimical sign, it is called *Suptha.*  

6\. When it is defeated in planetary war, it is termed *Nipiditha.*  

7\. While it is in heliocal setting, it is called *Mushita.*  

8\. While it is approaching its exaltation sign it is named *Parihiyamanavirya.*  

9\. While it is approaching its exaltation sign it is termed *Pravriddhavirya.*  

10\. The planet placed in the vargas of benefics after its rising, is called *Adhikavirya.*

Some of the terms are explained below:

*Exalted Planet-*The planets Sun to Saturn are exalted in the signs 1, 2, 10, 6, 4, 12 and 7 respectively. In these signs the respective planets are strong.

*Debilitated Planet -*The Sun to Saturn are in debilitation sign when they are respectively in 7, 8, 4, 12, 10, 6 & 1.

*Neechabhimukh Planet-* is one that is just to go into its debilitation sign e.g. Sun in Virgo, Moon in Libra.

*Uchchabhimukh Planet-* is one that is just to go into its exaltation sign e.g. Sun in Pisces, Moon in Aries.

दीप्ते सिद्धिदनुत्तमा नरपतेदीने च दैन्यागमः  

स्वस्थे स्वे मनसि स्थितं च भवति श्रीकीर्तिसौख्यादिकम् ।  

आमोदो मुदिते यथेप्सितफलप्राप्तिः प्रसुप्ते विक्त्पीडा  

शत्रुकृता प्रपीठिततनौ मोषं गतेऽर्थक्षयः ॥ ७॥  

भवति प्रवृद्धवीर्ये गजतुरगसुवर्णभूलाभः ।  

तददधिवीर्ययुक्ते शक्तित्रयसम्पदादिवाहुल्यम् ॥ ८॥

**Results of Planetary states Diptha, etc :** When a planet is in Diptha state full acquisition of the desired objects is to be foretold. If it be in the Dina state it indicates impending poverty.

If the planet be in the Swastha state, the object will be accomplished and there will be acquisition of wealth, fame andhappiness in addition. If it be in the Muditha state, there will be all-round happiness, and the accomplishement of desired objects.

If the planet be in the Prasuptha state, there will be danger and accidents etc. If it is in the Prapiditha state, there will be troubles through enemies. If it be in the Mushitha state, there will be loss of wealth. If the planet be in Pravriddhavirya state there will be acquisition of elephants, horses, gold and lands i.e. wealth. If it be in Adhivirya state, it bestows the three kinds of powers (उत्साह, मन्त्र, andप्रभु the powers of energy, good-counsel and majesty.) and extensive properties.

*NOTES:* The reader may study verses 22 to 24, Chapter I of Prasnatantra with benefit, wherein Nilakantha seems to follow Daivajnavallabha very closely.

Use of these principles in prediction is as follows: Suppose there is a query about acquisition of wealth. Suppose further that the lord of the ascendant and the lord of the eleventh house are both in the states Diptha, Swastha, Muditha or Adhivirya. Then it has to be interpreted that the object will be accomplished and that there will be acquisition of wealth. But if both these planets be in Mushita or Dina states, results will be quite opposite and unpleasant.

**The duty of the querist:** The querist should worship in his house, the planets and the rasi chakra (zodiacal diagram)\] and the stars with flowers, fruits, gold and precious stones. He should be full of devotion towards God and the planets and should offer homage to deities and preceptors. Carrying flowers, gems, fruits and sacred vice he should go to the astrologer and pay respects to him and with great reverence, facing an auspicious direction (east, north etc.) he should put the query to him with a pure mind and that query should be put once only.

*NOTES:* Worship of rasi diagram is a customary ritual from ancient times and the same is considered to be an important part of the procedure of putting queries (प्रश्नकर्म). Its importance has been pointed out in almost all the works on Horary Astrology. For Example:

रम्यतरे भूभागे सम्पूज्य ग्रहगणं सनक्षत्रम् ।  

पश्चात्प्रश्नविधानं कुर्याद्येनाप्नुयात्सिद्धिम्॥  

प्रष्टामणिकनकयुतैः फलकुसुमैराशिचक्रमभ्यर्च्य ।

-Acharya Bhattotpala

राशिचक्रं समभ्यर्च्य फलैः पुष्पैः सरत्नकैः।  

प्रष्टा सुभूमौ दैवज्ञं सकृत्पृच्छेत्प्रयोजनम् ॥

-Nilakantha

Prasna Tantra I प्रकरण, Sls. 3 & 15

The reader may refer to Prasnamarga, Adhyaya II for further details in this regard.

The second point to be noted is that the querist should have faith in the science of Astrology and the astrologer and should not put questions for fun or mockery as it will go vain and has been forbidden by the shastras. Also only a single question should be put ata time.

The most important point to be noted in respect of the querist is that he should have absolute faith both in the science of astrology

as well as the astrologer. To ensure faith in the two the procedure prescribed is apparently more than enough. Nobody would worship the horoscope unless he has faith in astrology. As regards the faith in astrologer the querist is required to offer flowers etc. to the astrologer when asking the questions. Offering flowers is a sort of surrendering oneself to the astrologer which is not possible unless the person has a regard for the astrologer.

As regards the number of questions to be asked at one particular time the general directive is that only one question should be asked at a particular time. Daivajna Neela Kantha has also said the same thing. This restriction has been imposed perhaps for the reason that the answers are based on the ascendant and other houses in relation to it. One rasi remains on the horizon for abont two hours. Unless smaller divisions of a rasi by way of the cusp of the ascendant are studied it is not possible to answer many questions. If somehow more than one question at a time spring up in the mind of the querist there is a system prescribed for that also. First question should be replied to on the basis of the ascendant and the following questions, if any, should be replied to on the basis of the position of Moon, Sun and Jupiter etc. Some astrologers ask for a number either between 1 and 108 or 1 and 249 (both inclusive in each case). The sanctity of numbers 1 to 108 is that each rasi has nine padas of constellations. In other words the reply is based on the position of the cusps in the various padas of Constellations: One pada of the constellation will take less than 15 minutes to pass. The division of the Zodiac in 249 divisions appears to be a better practice because here we get very small Units and the Cusp would take about 4 minutes to change its position. The later procedure is generally known as Krishnamurti Padhdhati. The basis in each case is the smaller sub divisions of the Zodiac.

प्रश्नाक्षरैरुदयहेतुभिरुल्लसदिभ-  

र्बाह्यस्थितैश्च शकुनैरधिगम्य सम्यक् ।  

प्रष्टुः शुभं च यदि वाप्यशुभं प्रयत्नात्तत्कालजं  

तदिह दैवविदाज्यभिधेयम् ॥११॥

The astrologer should understand the good and bad results by considering carefully the syllables of the query as also the omens obtaining around and then proclaim the prediction for that time.[^2]

फल भरकुसुमाभिरामभूमीरुहभुवि गोमयपुष्पतोयवत्याम् ।  

[^2]: "Prasna Jnana, Sls. 3-4"

चरणासुखकृति पृच्छतां स्यादभिमतसिद्धिरसंशयेन पुंसाम् ॥ १२ ॥

If the query is put in a place charming trees laden with flowers, which, is rendered pure by cow-dung, flowers and water and a place pleasing to the eyes, surely men will accomplish their desired objects without any doubt.

दृकचेतसोः सुखकरी यदि भूमिरस्ति  

मांगल्यवस्तुविषये शुभ दर्शने चेत् ।  

प्रच्छाविधौ शुभनुपस्थितमादरेण तत्रापि  

वाच्यमिति वक्ति भयोमणित्थः॥ १३ ॥

If the place is pleasing to the eyes and the mind, if there be sight of auspicious objects at the time of the query, good results in response to the query are bound to happen in near future thus say the acharyas Maya and Maniththa.

*NOTES:* Varahamihir has clearly stated in his Brihat Samhita that rsults of the query are influenced by the nature of the place where the query has been put.

"स्थानं.......चितं तुषैश्शुष्कतृणैर्नशोभनम्॥"

*Prasnasindhu, Muhurta Chintamani, Prasna Marga* and other works have also stated that sight of auspicious objects during a query will definitely produce good results.

In the slokas 11 to 13 the sage has provided guide lines for the astrologer to start with the question. The first thing is that he should consider carefully the syllables of the questions which in themselves convey the results of the question to the astrologer. Daivajna Rama Dayalu in Sanketa VIII Sloka 16 has given the list of syllables owned

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.Prasna Jnana Sis 3-4. 2 Prasana marga..3 Cf. Prasna Jnana, SI. 5.

by various planets. They are a good guide to the astrologer in identifying the planet that is troubling the most.

Some astrologers do the work through the offerings brought by the querist. If it is the white Barfi the indication is that Venus is the main cause of worry. In the offerings the astrologers see the colour etc. and identify the planet. The experience shows that in most cases the offering does indicate the trouble.

The other important aid is the omen. Omens are events that occur unexpectedly at a particular moment of time. Butterfly in a hot summer noon in a room can never be imagined but they have been sighted and result predicted.

The third important factor that has been underlined here is the place where the question is asked. If it is a beautiful garden where the question is asked the result shall be different from what it would have been had the question been asked in a place where cow dung is stored.

While all of them are important aids over-emphasis on them is not desirable. It is finally the horary chart that should be relied upon. About the omens particularly much cannot be said. All omens are not to be taken into account. If a seriously ill person suddenly starts moaning, the same should not be considered as an omen. Further according to the Prasna Marga the results of omens concern past, present and future. Reference may be made to sloka 9 chapter 3 of **Prasna Marga Part I published by Ranjan Publications.**

शकुनफलानामपि भूतानागतवर्तमानत्वम्

Hence in the first place we have to see whether the omen is about the present, past or future. Then the analysis should follow. Analysis is also not an easy job. The same event can be interpreted differently in different cases. A man comes to ask a question about the possibility of his wife joining him. As he asks the question the lady of the house reports to the astrologer that the rope used for drawing the water from the well has been broken and the vessel tied with the rope has fallen into the well. Normally it can be interpreted

to mean that there is no hope of the union now because the last string of love has broken down. In fact this was the interpretation of all the disciples of the Daivajna except one who said that the string that was keeping away the water of the vessel to unite with the water of the well has been broken and that the couple will be happily re-united. Actually this is what happened. The wife united with the husband very soon and thereafter remained with him happily. Correct interpretation of the omen is very difficult. What is therefore most important is the horary chart and its analysis should be given pride of place in predctions.

In short the astrologer should be alert enough to watch around him. The touching of a part of the body by the questioner, the syllables uttered by him, the number given by him, offerings brought by him, sight of auspicious objects, soothing place and omens etc. have a bearing on the question in the mind of the questioner. The position of Moon and / or lagna-lord in Ithesala also help to understand the question before it is spelt out.

**इति श्रीवराहमिहिरविरचितायां दैवज्ञवल्लभायां प्रश्नावताराध्यायः प्रथमः**

Thus ends the I Chapter Prasnavatara (Beginning of the Query) in the work Daivajnavallabha of Varabamihira



SECOND

**Good and Bad Results**

**शुभाशुभाध्यायः**

प्रष्टुः शुभैः पंचभिरिष्टलाभोऽनिष्टप्रदैः पंचभिरप्यनिष्टम् ।  

तुल्यैर्बलाबलवशात्फलमूहनीयं ज्ञेयं चतुर्भिरथ वापि फलं बलाच्य ॥ १ ॥

The five auspicious omens produce the achievement of desired objects. And the five inauspicious omens lead to undesirable result. If both auspicious and inauspicious omens seen, the result has to be told by a judgement of the strength of the omens. Results can be proclaimed on the basis of the strength of even four or less number of omens.

*NOTES:* Omens have been classified into five kinds : 1. sight of objects (animate or inanimate), 2. their sound, 3. their movement, 4. action, 5. utpata (unusual phenomenon portending evil). These have been discussed in great detail by Varahamihir in his Brihat Samhita. If all the five are auspicious, objects of query will be accomplished. If all are bad, it will not be achieved. Also the result of a weak omen is not to be taken into account. Only strong omens become the deciding factor.

Omens are the occurences that take place at the beginning of any event. Every occurence is not an omen. It should be something different from the common happening at the particular time.

Omens have been given pride of place in almost all classical works of horary astrology. Sage Varahamihir in his Brihat Samhita

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. (i) Vide Brihat Samhita-Chapter 46, and 86 to 95.  
(ii) Cf:षट् पंचाशिकाChapter I, Sl. 3.  
प्रश्नज्ञान,SIs. 8-9 and 13-14  
जातकपारिजात, Chapter XI, SI. 1.

says that the omens indicate the good or bad results of the native's Poorva Karmas or the past deeds that are about to fructify at the present moment.

अन्यजन्मान्तरकृतं कर्म पुंसां शुभाशुभम्  

यत्तस्यशकुनः पाकं निवेदयति गच्छताम् ॥

Chapter 86 sloke 5.

In Prasna Marga the learned author has asked the astrologer to pay special attention to some things and out of those things the omens are one that have to be given special consideration.

It may be stated here that the omens are not more general indications but are quite a comprehensive aid to divination. They indicate the directions also. The only thing is that the astrologer should be able to understand and interpret their correct meaning relevant to the query at hand. For a detailed study about the omens the readers are advised to refer to Brihat Samhita where the sage has classified the omens, and has also said which of the omens should be attended to and which ignored.

भावः स्वेशेनेक्षितो वा युतः स्यात्पापादन्यैर्वापि तस्यास्ति वृद्धिः।  

सौम्या यस्वान्त्यास्तखस्वाम्बुगा वा पापैरेवं हानिशदेशनीया ॥ २ ॥

The house which is associated or aspected by its lord flourishes and yields its results fully. If the places 2, 4, 7, 10 and 12 counted from a house are occupied by benefics, the house flourishes. If the said places are occupied by malefics, it decays.

*NOTES*: There are some additional rules mentioned in other works which are noteworthy in this connection: (1) The house wherein a planet is in debilitation or inimical quarters decays. (2) If the lord of a house is placed in 6, 8 and 12th houses, the house decays. (3) If the lords of 6, 8 and 12th houses are placed in a malefic house, the house is destroyed. (4) The house having a large number Of vargas of malefics undergoes destruction. (5) The house where a planet is in exaltation, moolatrikona, friendly quarters or own sign

flourishes well. (6) The house having an abundancy of benefic vargas also flourishes well.

The houses 6, 8 and 12 are generally regarded as inauspicious and their lords as damaging the prospects of the houses occupied by them. As these houses are counted from the lagna they may be inauspicious or harmful in respect of the affairs of lagna like the health, accidents and death etc. They may be auspicious and helpful in the promotion of the affair of some other house or houses. The 8th house is 11th house counted from the 10th house. It shall therefore be helpful in the advancement of career etc.



The 5th house is

considered to be the most auspicious house. The same is not so if we are interested to know the gain or losses of the enemy because it is 11th to the 7th house, the house indicating the interest of the enemy. In fact the house should be reckoned from the house under judgement. This fact has been clearly stated by the Daivajna in slokas 17 and 18 of this very chapter.

Much has also been made of the dignities and other states of planets in respect of the planets occupying the house. It is a fact that neither all the planets signify the affairs of a particular house nor their exaltations etc. help to any appreciable extent their power of giving results. Fulfilment of the objects of the affairs of any house is a complicated affair. It does not depend upon any one of the planets. Sometimes the planet appears to be giving good results but ultimately it is realised that the same was tainted with equal amount of evil. Here is a case that shall prove the point.

The native has no child. Fifth house needs examination. The house is unoccupied. It has no evil aspect. Its lord Mars occupies kendra, not a bad position but he does not aspect his own house. Jupiter the karaka for childern occupies his own house. Being the

lord of kendra does not make him a functional malefic because he occupies the house. Despite this the native remains childless. Neither the lord of the house benefitted the native nore benefic Jupiter showered his grace. For reasons we have to go elsewhere. Here is another case. The native is unmarried. The lagna and lagnesh

are vargottam. Mercury the 11th lord is exalted. Jupiter is exalted in the 9th house. Venus the 7th lord as well as the kalatra karaka is also not very badly placed. Despite allthis the marriage was not given. It is true that there are reasons in the charts which explain 'why' of the matter. The point is that the dignities or other avastha's do verylittle in giving the results.

The different synonyms of the names of the twelve houses as also the names acquired by them through their functions are being told according to the opinion of the ancient sages. From these the results of the querries have to be judged.

NOTES*:* Lagna, Prathama Bhava, Kalpa, Hora etc. are the paryayas or synonyms for the 1st house. Body, form, longevity etc. are the indications of the 1st house and these are called its functional names (कार्यसंज्ञा).

Health, honour, qualities, nature, conduct, age, state, caste, purity, happiness, misery, expression, form, colour nephew-All these are to be judged from the first house.

The first house has been termed as the house of the wife of the son of the sister because, the house of the sister is the 3rd, her progeny is 5th i.e. 7th and his wife is 7th from 7th i.e. first house.

NOTES: Short travels, victory in debates, efforts and eating habits are also to be judged from this house.

Although normally the "wife of the son" is considered from the 11th house as the house is 7th (wife) of 5th (son). But if we adopt the dictum of "BHAVAT BHAVAM" we can take the house 5th to 5th i.e. 9th as the house of the son and his wife 7th from 9th i.e. the 3rd house.

Renunciation, enjoyments, sacrifices, marriage, donation, cultivation, expenditure, injury, maternal uncle, mother's sister, wife of maternal uncle wars, defeat in a war are matters to be seen from the 12th house.

It seems that the author is considering the maternal uncle from the 12th house on the assumption that the 10th house relates to the father and as such 3rd from it (12th) would be his younger brother. But in reality the house relating to father is the 9th and as such the 11th & not the 12th is the house of the younger brother of father.

**Combinations for success of the object of the query:** If the ascendant falls in a sirshodaya sign or in the sign of a benefic planet, the result of the query will be auspicious. Under opposite circumstances, results will be just the reverse. If the circumstances are mixed, results will be also found to be of mixed nature.

*NOTES:* (i) Gemini, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Aquarius are Sirshodaya signs.

*NOTES :* The Moon is weak from Dasami (10th) of the dark half (Krishna Paksha) to the Panchami (5th) of the bright half (Sukla Paksha). Other authors are of the opinion that Moon is weak from Ashtami (8th) of Krishna Paksha to Saptami (7th) of Sukla paksha.

*NOTES:* Prithuyasas has rightly pointed out the necessity for considering Lagna and the Moon before judging the results-

From sloka 20 onwards the author has given the combinations which indicate success in the pursuit of the object of the query. Sanketa Nidhi also details almost similar combinations. Sloka 9 of Sanketa VII and slokas 21, 22 and 23 of Sanketa VIII refer. They are general statement of facts.

Neelakantha has however dealt with this subject scientifically and appears more convincing. He says that the querist will gain the object of his desire if the

2\. Lagan lord aspects the lord of the query or vice versa

**Gains and Losses**

**लाभाऽलाभाध्यायः**

स्युर्लाभप्रदा ददति नेष्टफलानि पापाः ।  

स्थानं शुभा दशमसप्तमगाश्च दद्युर्मा-  

नार्थदा द्वितयपंचमलग्नगाश्च ॥१ ॥

If benefics are placed in the 11th, 7th, 5th and the 3rd houses they cause gain.Malefics placed in these houses do not yield desired result. Benefics placed in the 10th or 7th bestow status and position upon the native. When they are placed in the 2nd, 5th or 1st house they confer respect, honour and wealth upon the native.

NOTES: The tenth house represents honour, respect, status and rank. The seventh is a Kendra and planets therein fully aspect the lagna.

The 10th house is one of status. Being 10th to 10th, the 7th house too can be considered as the house of status. Hence benefics in the 7th and 10th house are conducive to status. The benefics in the ascendant are conducive to name and fame, because like the 10th, the first house too stands for name and fame. The 2nd- and 5th are houses of wealth. Benefics in these houses will naturally enhance wealth.

Prithuyas in Shatpanchashika says the same thing. Sloka 2 in Chapter 4 refers. He says that when benefis occupy the 3rd, 5th, 11th and 7th house they are indicative of gains. Malefics in the same places are not conducive to good results.

1\.

Compares षट्पंचशिकChap. IV, SI. 2-3



Here we need a clear definition of *labha* or gain. There are two types of gains. The one is the gain of position and rank or name and fame. The other gain is in terms of money or wealth. It may also be added here that the one is not the synonym for the other. The astrologer should be quite clear in his divination about what he means. House 11 stands for income or gains in financial terms. House 2 indicates the personal acquisition or the bank balance. The houses touched here are 10 the and 7 the. The former stands for the Karmasthana of the native indicating name, fame and honour. The 7th house is 10th to the 10th and as such may be taken to represent the same port-folio as the 10th house. The eleventh house to the 11th is 9th house and second to the second is the third house. They may also be clubbed together standing for income and personal acquisitions. There should be no ambiguity in the language. Unless the houses concerning economic or material gains are involved the material gains should not be foretold.

चन्द्रं सप्तदशद्विषष्ठसहजायस्थानसंस्थं शुभः  

पश्येद्वै प्रमदाकृतं शुभफलं लाभादिकं स्यात्तदा ।  

लग्नाष्टजिनवात्मजेषु च भयं कार्यार्थनाशोऽशु-  

मैरेतेष्वेव गताः शुभास्तु शुभदा मानार्थ सम्पत्तये ॥२ ॥

If the Moon is placed in the 7th, 10th, 2nd, 6th, 3rd or 11th places and is aspected by benefics, the person will get good results through a lady or he will have gains through the help of a woman. But if the Moon is placed in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th or 9th houses aspected by evil planets, he will cause fear. There will be destruction or failure in undertakings and expenditure of wealth. If benefics are situated in these houses, they will confer status, wealth, property and other good results upon the native.

*NOTES:* The Moon, being a feminine planet causes gains etc. through ladies while placed in the auspicious places mentioned above. Care must be taken to ensure that the Moon is not afflicatedin these places by being debilitated etc.

Prithuyasas is of the opinion that only malefics in 1, 3, 5, 8 and

9 cause only good results. It is possible that the author is refering to weak Moon and therefore, a malefic in these places.

There would appear some difficulty about the position of Moon in Kendra and Trikonasthana or the quadrants and trines. Prithuyasas and Varahamihira both assert that benefics in Kendras and Trikonas are a welcome augury. Sloka 1 of Chapter 4 of Shatpanchashika says that when benefics occupy the Kendras and Trikonas or when the Malefics are in places other than the Kendras and the 8th house it should be predicted that the persons concerned will realise their cherished ambitions in full. Moon is considered to be both a benefic and a malefic according to its position of waning and waxing. These sages, it appears, have taken him to be malefic only. Prithuyasas specifically says in sloka 3 of chapter 4 that**लग्नेशशी न शुभदा** Similarly Varahamihir says that Moon in lagna causes fear.

त्रिकोणकेन्द्रालयगाः शुभग्रहास्तथाऽशुभाश्च त्र्यरिलाभगा यदि ।  

भवन्ति लाभाय तदाऽऽशु पृच्छतां विपर्ययस्थास्तु न लाभदा अमी ॥३ ॥

If Benefics are placed in triangular houses and quadrants and malefics in 3, 6, and 11th houses, the querist will have gains very quickly. If they are situated otherwise (in the opposite manner) they do not produce any gain.

*NOTE :* लग्नात्पंचमभास्य कोणसंज्ञा विधीयते । 5th and 9th houses from the ascendant are termed Kona (triangular) houses. Some include the lagna also. 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses are termed Kendra houses. Bhattotpala has stated that if benefics are in Kona houses and Malefics are in Kendra houses, the desired objects are surely accomplished.

NOTES: This is the opinion of Prithuyasas and Bhattotpala also. Acharya Siddha Narayana Dasa, however, is of the opinion that the desired object is obtained with difficulty after some time.

स्थिरे विलग्ने न गमागमौ स्तस्वरे विलग्ने तु विनिश्चितौ तौ ।  

मिश्रं फलं स्थावितनौ तदर्धंद्वये चरस्थावरवत्तदूह्यम् ॥१॥

If the ascendant of query falls in a fixed sign, there is no coming and going (i.e., no travels). If it falls in a movable sign, travel (coming and going) definitely occurs. If the ascendant falls in a dual sign, the first and second half of the dual sign produce the results similar to movable and fixed signs.

NOTES: Mesha, Karka, Tula and Makara are movable signs. Vrishabha, Simha, Vrischika and Kumbha are fixed signs. Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus and Meena aretermed dual signs. If the query relates to travel or return of a person it will take place if the ascendant falls in a Chara (Movable sign). If the lagna falls in the first half of a dual sign, travel etc. will materialise but it will not if the ascendant etc. falls in the second half of the dual sign.

सूरसौरिगुरुसौम्यसितानामेककोपि चरलग्नगतश्चेत् ।

Even if one among the planets Sun, Saturn, Mercury and Venus be placed in the ascendant identical with a Chara (movable sign) travel takes place early. But if this planet is retrograde there will be no travel.

*NOTES:* As the Sun is never retrograde, the condition of direct motion applies only to the remaining three planets. Prithuyasas has also given this condition in Shatpanchasika.

गंतुः पथो निवृत्तिं जनयति निःसंशयं प्रश्ने ॥ ३ ॥

If the ascendant falls in a fixed sign with one among Jupiter, Mercury, Venus or Sun is placed therein, the traveller breaks his journey and returns without any doubt.

रविर्वा गुरुर्वा बुधो वा सितो वा भवेदाराशिस्थितः प्रश्नकाले ।  

गतिः प्रच्छतः शीघ्रमेवाभिधेया निवृत्तिं पथोऽमीमिरन्त्यालयस्यैः ॥४ ॥

If at the time of query, one of the planets Sun, Jupiter, Mercury or Venus be placed in the eleventh house, the person will have to go out on a journey very early. But if one of these planets be placed in the 12th house, he breaks his journey and returns-Thus one ought to tell.

It seems that the Sun, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter are planets intimately linked to travels. Their location in the house of gains ( 11th) means the gain of travels and their location in 12th a negation of travel.

रांगिरसोः परयेदेकोपि वा स्थिरं समुद्यन्तम् ।  

प्रष्टऽऽगमनं प्रच्छेत्तस्यागमनं न वक्तव्यम् ॥५ ॥

If the ascendant falls in a fixed sign and even if one of Saturn or Jupiter aspects the same and if the query relates to the return of a person who has gone to distant lands, the reply should be that there, is no return.

षष्ठत्रिकोणसंस्थ पापैश्च पापसंदृष्टैः ।  

गमनागमनं न वाच्यं स्थिरलग्ने चेच्चरे तु विपरीतम् ॥६ ॥

If the ascendants fall in a fixed sign and there is aspect of malefic planets on the malefics placed in 5, 6, and 9th houses travel is not to be predicted. But if the ascendant falls in a movable sign, travel will take place definitely.

चन्द्रतोऽथ यदि वा विलग्नतो द्वादशद्वितयराशिगामिनः ।  

शुक्रवाक्यतिशशांकनन्दनाः का गमऽऽगमकथाऽस्ति पृच्छतः ॥ ७ ॥



If Venus, Jupiter or Mercury is placed in the 2nd or 12th sign from Lagna or Chandra lagna what is there to be told about travel, to the querist.

*NOTES:* That is, there is nothing to be told. In other words travel will not take place. Nor will the person in exile come back.

As already mentioned in Sloka No. 4, Sun is one of the planets causing travels. But there is no mention of the Sun in this sloka. It appears, that the main cause for travel is nature of planets as malefics or benefics. When benefic planets surround the lagna by occupying the 2nd and the 12th house, they naturally influence the lagna and thereby work as shubha factors against giving travels.

Here the sage has told the relationship of journey with the nature of rasi rising in the east at the time of the query that is the lagna. Daivajna Neelkantha in this respect has given more importance to the position of the lord of ascendant and his Ithasaala with other planets. He says that there will be a journey-

\(a\) if the lagnesha is in Kendra and there is ithasaala with the 9th lord; or

\(b\) ninth lord occupies the lagna and is in ithasaala with, the legna lord; or

\(c\) the lagna lord is in the Kendra and is in ithasaala with the planet in the 3rd house and there is no malefic.

Badarayana tells us about the return of the native that it depends upon the planets occupying hourses 2 and 3. Varahamihira also supports the view of Badarayana: when he says

लग्नतः सहजपुत्रवित्तग दूरगागमनशंसिनो ग्रहाः ।  

नष्टलम्भनकराः शुभग्रहाः शीघ्रमागमकरौ तु मन्त्रिणौ ॥

(If there is a planet in houses 2, 3, 5 the native returns and if Jupiter and Venus in these houses the native returns early).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. Compare प्रश्नज्ञान, Sloka 20.

Daivajna Rama Dayalu in Sanketa 8 sloka 34 says that if there is a question whether there will be any journey and if so when, the answer would be that there would be an early journey if the Prasna lagna falls in a movable sign owned by a benefic planet. If the ascendant falls in a fixed sign aspected by Moon there shall be a journey. The ascendant falling in a dual sign indicates that there will be a journey and return.

बलेन सर्वोत्तमतामुपागतो ग्रहो गृहे यावति लग्नतो भवेत् ।  

प्रवासतस्तत्समसंख्यमासतो विवर्तनं गन्तुरसंशयं वदेत् ॥ ८ ॥

**Time of return:** Count the number of the signs in which the strongest planet is placed away from the lagna. The person in exile will return in so many months as indicated by this number. There is no doubt regarding this.

If the said planet is in the navamsha of a movable sign the number of months revealed is as stated. If it is in the navamsha of a fixed sign the time involved will be double and if it is in navamsha of a dual sign it will be three times of it.

चरांशकस्थो किल कात्म एवं स्थिरांशके तद्विगुणस्तु वाच्यः ।  

द्विदेहलग्नांशगते ग्रहे विचिन्तितस्तत्रिगुणो विधेयः ॥ ९ ॥

If the strongest planet is placed in a movable navamsha the time period is to be taken as indicated. But if it be in fixed Navamsha, the time period is to be doubled. And if the strongest planet be in a dual navamsha the time period is to be trebled.

NOTES: Suppose the strongest planet is placed in the 4th sign from lagna. If it be in a chara navamsha the period is to be taken as 4 months. If it be in a fixed navamsha, it is to be taken as 8 months. If it be in a dual navamsha the period is to be taken as 3 x 4 = 12 months. But this rule will not apply where the period of return is expected to

Scholars, well versed in Horary Astrology declare that at the time when the lord of the 7th house from the ascendant of query becomes retrograde, the person in exile, returns.

*NOTES*: Acharya Prithuyasas vide (षट् पंचाशिक genres Chapter II, Sloka 16) has recommended the time of retrogression of the lord of the 7th house of the ascendant of travel of the traveller. The rule is not without defect as if the ascendant falls in Capricorn or Aquarius lord of the 7th house will be the Sun or the Moon which will never become retrograde. Hence it is obvious that the rule applies only to ascendant to other than Capricorn and Aquarius. The rule is quite cogent as the 7th house is representative of the "way." And then it would appear that the traveller will never return. Hence the rule requires further investigation.

Additional note

The chapter deals with travels and journey. It would be useful for the lay readers if they know what the various houses of the horary chart stands for.Neelakantha in this respect says that the ascendant stands for the experience of phlysical pleasure and pain or comforts and discomforts on the way. The fourth house indicates the place where the person has gone.

Gaimini in his Gnana Pradeepika has given more detailed an account of the houses. He says that:

\(a\) lagna stands for health and longevity of the person;  

\(b\) 2nd house for financial gains  

\(c\) 3rd house for persons following or assisting  

\(d\) 4th for return to residence  

\(e\) 5th & 6th for experiences in the journey  

\(f\) 7th house for the place where he has gone  
(g) 8th house for troubles in the journey  
(h) 9th house for incidents and accidents  
(i) 10th house for residence away from home  
(j) 11th house for gains and 12th for losses.

Here ends Chapter IV entitled "Travels in general" of the work

Dalvajnavallabha.



**FIFTH**

**The Invasion and Retreat of Enemies**

**शत्रुगमागमाध्यायः**

पापै रिपुस्थैर्यदि वा सुतस्यैर्निवर्तते वर्त्मत एव शत्रुः ।  

चतुर्थगैरन्तिकसंगतोऽपि पराङ्मुखो गच्छति भग्नसैन्यः॥ १॥

If the 5th or 6th house is occupied by malefics the enemy retreats on the way. When malefics are placed in the IV house, the enemy-even though he might have approached very near will have his forces defeated and destroyed and thereafter returns disinterested.

*NOTES*: If the 4th house is occupied by a malefic, the enemy even when he has come close, retreats after getting his forces destroyed.

It would be relevant here, as in any other case of judging the charts and declaring the results, to know what the various houses stand for in respect of the query. The chapter is regarding the invasion of the enemy and the ultimate results thereof. Shatpanchashika throws some light on the subject. The six houses commencing from the 3rd house of the Prasna lagna stand for the citizens or the town attacked. The other six houses relate to the invaders. The town attacked here may also mean the kingdom as a whole. The benefic or malefic influences on the house 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th would therefore indicate the position of the party attacked and those on houses 9th to 2nd about the position of Invaders. Those who go to attack are called the *Yayee* or the goers and those who are attacked are called the *Nagar* or the citizens. Results, good or bad, to these houses would reveal the good or bad of the party concerned. Sloka 2 Chapter III give this idea.

चतुर्थगैरलिमीनकर्कटैः पराजयो भवति शुनैर्विलोकनात् ।  
चतुष्पदैः पुनरिह तुर्यवर्तिभिः पलायते नियतमरातिरागतः ॥ २॥

If the fourth house falls in the signs Scorpio, Pisces or Cancer and is aspected by benefic planets the enemy is defeated. If there be a quadruped sign on the fourth house, the enemy who has come with the intention of conquering definitely runs away.

*NOTES:* Aries, Taurus and Leo which are represented by quadrupeds are called the quadruped signs.

Sanketa Nidhi also says the same thing. Sloka 52 of Sanket VIII refers. If it is a question of victory or defeat and if the ascendant happens to be Aries, Taurus, Leo, Virgo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Scorpio or Aquarius success may be predicted. This is more so when a strong benefic occupies or aspects the ascendant.

It appears from the various slokas that the houses in such horary charts are fixed irrespective of the querent.

It may also have to be mentioned here that the aspect rather than occupation has its effects on the house concerned. This is apparent from sloka 2 here that fourth house has to be aspected by benefic planets to cause the defeat of the enemy. Fourth house here represents the party attacked. In the Sanketa Nidhi however it says that strong benefic occupies or aspects ascendant. If the benefic occupies the ascendant he will aspect 7th house which relates to the invaded party and as such helpful to him. If the benefic aspects the lagna it helps the invading party. Normally these are not the days of one king attacking the other and as such not much of research can be undertaken.

चरोदये भवति यदा शुभग्रहस्तदा भृशं जनयति यानिनां शुभम् ।  
चरोदये त्वशुभसमन्विते शुभं स्थिरोदये भवति शुभं व्यवस्थया ॥ ३ ॥

If the ascendant falls in a movable sign (Chara rasi) and contains a benefic planet, then surely it causes more auspicious results to the kings who attack. If the movable ascendant is combined with a malefic planet surely inauspicious results occur to them. If a

fixed sign rises with benefic planet in it definitely good results are produced.

स्थिरे शशांके चरराशिलग्ने नवांशके वाऽस्यरिपुस्तदैति ।  

चरे शशांके स्थिरराशिलग्ने नवांशके तस्य तु वागमः स्यात् ॥ ४ ॥

If the Moon is placed in a fixed sign and the ascendant is on a movable sign, or Navamsha, the enemy surely comes. But if the Moon is in a movable sign and the ascendant falls in a fixed sign or Navamsha, the enemy does not attack.

शीतगौ द्वितनुराशिसंस्थिते लग्नतामुपगतो यदि स्थिरः ।  

शत्रुरेत्य विनिवर्ततेऽरिभे ज्ञेज्यशुक्रसहिते विनश्यति ॥ ५॥

If the Moon is in a dual sign, and the ascendant falls in a fixed sign, the enemy comes and then returns. In this combination, if Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are placed in the sixth house, the enemy is destroyed.

*NOTES:* The principle seems to be that if malefics be placed in the 6th house, the enemy wins. If benefics are placed, he is defeated. Our experience however is that benefics in the 6th do not provoke the enemy for an attack and as such he can be considered as destroyed.

लग्ने स्थिरे गुरुशनैश्वरदृष्टिदृष्टे शत्रोर्न  

वा गमनमागमनं न वा स्यात् ।  
पापास्त्रिपंचरिपुगा रिपुसंगमाय  
तुयें स्थिताः पुनररातिनिवर्तनाय ॥ ६॥

If the ascendant falls in a fixed sign and is aspected by Jupiter and Saturn then either the enemy does not come or he may not go back after attacking. If malefics are placed in 3, 5 and 6 the enemy has to be faced. If they are placed in the 4th house, the enemy surely returns.

*NOTES:* In Shatpanchashika also we come across the same things. Sloka 10 of chapter II refers.

स्थिरोदये जीवशनैश्चरेक्षिते गमागमौ नैव वदेत् पृच्छतः  
त्रिपंचषष्ठा रिपुसंगमाय पापाश्चतुर्थी विनिवर्तनाय ।

Here it may be relevant to refer to Sanketa Nidhi which says when there would be a declaration of war and when there would be a compromise etc.

चन्द्रश्वरे द्वितनुलग्नमथो पथोऽर्धमागत्य  

गच्छति रिपुर्द्धितनौच चन्द्रे ।  
लग्ने चरे रिपुरुपैति बलद्वयेन  
पापेक्षणाद्भवति तस्य पराजयोऽपि ॥७॥

If the Moon is placed in a movable sign and the ascendant falls in a dual sign the enemy comes half way and then returns. If the Moon is placed in a dual sign and the ascendant falls in a movable sign, the enemy comes with two armies. But if the ascendant and the Moon are aspected by malefic planets, he is defeated also.

*NOTES:* Compare Sloka, &, Chapter II of Shatpanchashika. If there be benefic aspect over the ascendant and the Moon, the enemy will win.

चन्द्रार्कौ यदि हिमुले स्थितो भवेतामत्युग्रंन हि परचक्रमभ्युपैति ।  
आक्रान्त गुरुबुधभार्गवैश्चतुर्थ स्थानं चेत्त्वरितमुपैत्यरिस्तदानीम् ॥ ८ ॥

If the Moon and the Sun are situated in the 4th house, the terrible army of the enemy does not come. But if the 4th house is occupied by Jupiter, Mercury and Venus the enemy comes very soon.

*NOTES:* Sloka 11 of S. P. gives the same rule. This is in full agreement with the rule given by Sloka 1 of this Chapter. Moon with the Sun becomes weak and so the enemy does not come. (चतुर्थगैः पराङ्मुखो गच्छति भग्नसैन्यः ). Jupiter, Mercury and Venus being benefics, the army comes quickly.

सिंहाजकोदण्डवृषा भवन्ति विलग्नगा वापि चतुर्थगा वा ।  
ग्रहेण युक्ता यदि वा वियुक्ता ध्रुवं तदा तिष्ठति नैव शत्रुः ॥९॥

If the ascendant or the fourth house falls in the signs Leo, Aries, Sagittarius and Taurus and if no planet is situated in these places then also enemy will not be able to stay. This is certain.

*NOTES:* Prithuyasas says शत्रुर्निवर्त्तते i.e, the enemy retreats, to his place. According to the dictum "चतुष्पदैः पुनरिहतुर्यवर्त्तिभिः पलायते नियतमरातिरागतः" sloka 2 of this chapter, the enemy retreats. The additional point is, even if lagna falls in beastial signs, the enemy retreats. \[The rreason may be : As these beasts are capable of running, the indication is that the enemy will run away.\]

रवौ गुरौ वा स्थिरलग्न गामिनि स्थितो रिपुः स्वाश्रम एव निश्चलः ।  
रवौ गुरौ वाथ चरोदयस्थिते वदेदरातेरचिरात्समागमम् ॥१०॥

If there be a fixed sign on the ascendant and if it is occupied by the Sun or Jupiter, the enemy is quiet in his own place. But if the same planets are placed in a movable sign in the ascendant, it should be told that the enemy will come soon.

*NOTES:* This result is due to the influence of the movable and fixed signs which has already

been

discussed.

सुराचार्यदेवद्विषन्मन्त्रिणौद्वौद्वितीये तृतीये यथा वा तथा वा ।  
तदा क्षिप्रमायात्यरातिः स्थिरस्थैर्न लग्नेशधर्मेशकर्मेशमेशैः ॥११॥

If Jupiter and Venus are placed separately or together in the second or the third house, the enemy comes very soon. If the lords of the Ist, 9th and 10th house are placed in fixed signs, the enemy never

comes.

यवात्संख्यं भवति रजनीनाथगेहं विलग्नान्नैकोऽपि  
स्यान्नियतमनयोर्मध्यवर्ती ग्रहश्चेत् ।  

तावत्संख्यैरपि गतदिनैः शत्रुरागच्छतीति  
ज्योतिर्विद्याविपुलगणकग्रामणीरुद्गृणाति ॥१२ ॥

The time of attack of the enemy: If there be no planet between the ascendant and the Moon, the enemy will attack in as many days as are indicated by the house occupied by the Moon from the Lagna.

*NOTES:* Bhattotpala, commenting on Sloka 17, Chapter II of S. P. says that if there be an intervening planet between the ascendant and the Moon, the enemy will not come.

It would be useful here to refer to Gaimini's Gnana Pradeepika where he has identified the house for the invaders and for those who are attacked. The houses 4 to 9 of the horary chart tell us about the enemy or the invader. The houses 10 to 3 indicate the position of the other party. The position of malefics and benefics in the group and their strength or weaknesses etc. will help us in determining the final results. This is almost confirmed by the Shatpanchasika. It says that the six houses commencing from the 3rd relate to the citizens or the town attacked. The benefic planets in these houses help the chief of the town attacked.

Daivajna Neelakantha has said when there will be peace between the invading and the invaded kings, when there will be victory or defeat etc.

॥ इति श्री दैवज्ञवल्लभाध्याय पंचमः ॥

Here ends Chapter V entitled "The Invasion and Retreat of Enemies" of
Daivajnavallabha.



**SIXTH**

**Queries about one who is Abroad  
प्रवासचिन्ताध्यायः**

लग्नतः सहजपुत्रवित्तगा दूरगागमनशंसिनो ग्रहाः ।  
नष्टलम्भनकराः शुभग्रहाः शीघ्रमागमकरौतु मन्त्रिणौ॥ १ ॥

If all the planets are situated in 3rd, 5th and 2nd houses the person who has gone abroad surely returns. Benefics in these places cause the retrieval of lost objects. If Jupiter or Venus is placed there the person returns quickly.

*NOTES :* Badarayana says in this context:  

लग्नाद् द्वितीय भवनं तृतीयं वा ग्रहेण संयुक्तम्  
दूरगतस्यागमन प्रवृत्तिमथवा विनिर्दिशति ।

The saged says that the houses 2, 3, 5 indicate that the person gone out is planning to come back. If there are planets occupying these houses the person shall come back. He does not differentiate between the benefic and malefic planets here.

Returning home means the second house. Second to second house is the 3rd house. The 3rd house stands for journey. There should be some journey involved in coming back. The third to 3rd house is the 5th house. Thus for the return of the person on the basis of Bhavat Bhawam the three houses, namely 2nd, 3rd and 5th should be judged.

बृहस्पतौ केन्द्रगते तु कश्चन ग्रहो भवेत् षष्ठगतोऽथ सप्तमः ।  
भवेत्तदा प्रोषित पुरुषागमस्त्रिकोणगे चन्द्रसुते सितेऽपि वा ॥ २ ॥

If Jupiter is situated in a quadrant and there is a planet in the 6th or 7th then the person who has gone abroad returns. Similarly, if

Mercury or Venus is placed in the 5th or 9th houses the person returns.

NOTES: Vide Sloka of Chapter V of S. P. also. It is a general principle that, if the quadrants and trines are occupied by benefic auspicious results happen.

अष्टमे शशिनि पापवर्जिते कंटके सुखमुपैति चाध्वगः ।  
कंटकस्थितशुभग्रहैः शुभं स्वं निवासमयमेति लाभवान् ॥३ ॥

If the Moon is placed in the 8th house, and there is no malefic in the angles the person who has gone abroad returns happily. If there is a benefic planet in the angles, he returns with gains.

*NOTES:* The quadrants are to be free from malefic influence. This is a general principle for good results.

पृष्ठे लग्ने पापदृष्टे वधो वा बन्धो वा स्यात्सौम्यदृष्टे तु न स्यात् ।  
पापे षष्ठे केन्द्रगे वा तृतीये नष्टो भ्रष्टा स्थानतः प्रच्युतो वा ॥४ ॥

If a pristhodaya sign happens to be the ascendant and the same is aspected by a malefic, the person who has gone abroad is dead or he is in jail. If the ascendant is aspected by a benefic planet, the bad results do not happen. If a malefic is placed in the 6th, Kendra or 3rd house the person is either lost, gone elsewhere or has fallen from his position.

*NOTES:* Some interpret the results serially i.e., if, under the aboue conditions, an evil planet is placed in the 6th house, he is totally lost i.e. his whereabouts will not be traceable. If, it is situated in the Kendra, he has gone somewhere else from the place where he had already gone. If the planet is placed in the 3rd house, the person has fallen from his status i.e., he might have met with the losses in his business or might have lost his job etc.

**यथा तथा यदि भवतः कथंचन द्वये गये सुरगुरुदैत्यमन्त्रिणौ।**  
**प्रवासिना** **भवति तदा**

ऽऽ

**गमो नृणां तुरीयगौनियतगृह प्रवेशदौ**

॥ ५॥

If Jupiter and Venus be placed in the 2nd and 3rd houses in any manner, the person gone abroad, will surely return. If they be

placed in the 4th house, the person gone abroad definitely enters his house (returns).

NOTES: The 2nd house represents family. Benefics there cause re-union with the family i.e., the person will return. 3rd is 2nd to 2nd house. Perhaps this may be the reason (भगवद्भावसिद्धांतः) 4th represents the house. Benefics and particularly Jupiter and Venus will cause safe return of the person to his house.

पापकैः षष्ठलमत्रिकस्थायिभिः सौम्यकैः किंचकेन्द्रत्रिकोणस्थितैः ।  
दूरगस्यागमो निर्विशंकं स्फुटं जल्पनीयो ग्रहग्रन्थविद्भिः सदा ॥ ६ ॥

If malefics are placed in the 3rd or 11th houses and benefics are situated in Kendras and Thrikonas (ie., 1, 4, 7, 10, 5 and 9) the person surely returns.

NOTES: It is a well-known principle that placement of malefics in Upachayasthanas (3, 6, 10 and 11) and benefics in Kendras and Konas is auspicious. Whatever may be the query, this combination indicates good results.

Slokas 50 to 52 of Prasna Marga are relevant here.

1\. If the lord of lagna is placed in a house beyond 4th the traveller does not come back.

2\. The traveller does not return if natural malefics occupy Kendras.

3\. He does not come back if Moon is in 8th and Kendras occupied by malefics but if Moon and the malefics are aspected by benefics the person will come back.

For returning home

1\. If the lagnesha is posited in his Mula Trikona sign, sign of exaltation, in the 7th house or in retrograde motion.

2\. The Lagnesha in any house in retrograde motion with strong Jupiter in the quadrant.

अशुभर्क्षगतोऽशुमैश्चतुरस्रगृहेऽथवा त्रिकोणके ।  
दिवसेश्वरनन्दनोऽध्वगानां नियतं शंसति बन्धनं तदानीम् ॥७॥

If Saturn is placed in 4, 8, 9 or 5th house in the sign owned by a malefic and aspected by a malefic, the person who has gone abroad is definitely put to confinement in jail etc.

शुभयुक्ते स्थिरलग्ने सुस्थिरबन्धश्चरे त्वशुभयुक्ते ।  
क्षिप्रं भवति विमोक्षोद्वित्तनौ कालक्रमान्मोक्षः ॥ ८ ॥

If the ascendant falls in fixed sign and the same is occupied by a benefic the confinement is permanent. But, if the ascendant falls in a movable sign and contains a malefic planet, he is released from imprisonment early. If there is a dual sign on the ascendant, release takes place after some time.

*NOTES:* Confinement is of two kinds

temporary and long-lasting, and the conditions for the same told here. Vide Sloka11 of Prasna Tantra, also.

अरिभिरवलोक्यमानास्त्रिकोणयामित्रगाः पापाः ।  
पृष्ठोदयं विलग्नं सौम्यादृष्टं च पान्थमरणाय ॥९॥

If malefics are placed in 5th, 9th and 7th houses and if they are aspected by planets inimical to them and if the ascendant falls in a Prishthodaya sign not aspected by benefics death of the traveller on the way is indicated.

अध्वस्थाने सौम्यैरध्वा निरुपद्रवोऽध्वनीतस्य ।  
भयरोगपरिक्लेशाः पापैर्लग्नस्थितैस्तस्य॥१०॥

If a benefic is placed in the 9th house, the traveller does not encounter any kind of trouble on the way. If there be a maleficc planet on the ascendant there will be fear, diseases, difficulties and other troubles on the way.

*NOTES:*आध्वस्थान may be interpreted as 7th house or 9th house. If malefics are in this place representing the travel, the person meets with several kinds of troubles on his way. Vide Sloka 13 of Prasna Tantra also.

गृहे ग्रहो यावति लग्नतो भवेत्तदा हता द्वादश राशयः स्फुटम् ।  
अवेहि तावद्दिसैर्गतागमं निवर्तनं वक्रगतग्रहेण च ॥११ ॥

Time of Return:

The number of the house from ascendant in which a planet (in direct motion) is placed is to be multiplied by 12. The result will indicate the number of days the traveller will take to return. If, however, such a planet is retrograde the return will be in as many days as are signified by the number of signs from the Prasna Lagna to that occupied by the planet.

**EXPLANATION:** Note the number (counting from the ascendant) of the first sign occupied by a planet. If, it is in direct motion multiply the number by 12. But if the planet be retrograde, the bumber need not be multiplied by 12.

Another interpretation is that the number of days in which the planet becomes retrograde will be the time taken by the traveller to return. Or we have to take the planet that will cause the return and proceed on the above lines. This sloka is interpreted differently by different translators.

Sanketa Nidhi also says something like this. The return of the person should be predicted if the 7th lord in the Prasna lagna is in retrogade motion. The return would be within a month from the date or which the planet went retrograde.

The other method that is propounded there is to find out the strongest planet in the Prasna chart and count the houses where the planet is posited from the lagna. The return would be in as may months as there be the number of houses counted from the lagna.

॥ इति श्री प्रवासचिन्ताध्यायः ॥

Here ends Chapter VI of Daivajnavallabha entitled  

"Queries about who is in Asylum"



**SEVENTH**

**Success and Defeat  
जयपराजयाध्याः**

दशमसप्तमलग्नगताः शुभा नगरवासिनृपस्य जयप्रदाः ।  
शनिकुजौनवमे भयभंगदौविजयदा गुरुभार्गवचन्द्रजाः ॥१॥

The benefics placed in the 10th, 7th and Ist houses bestow victory to the king residing in the city, (i.e. one attacked). Saturn and Mars placed in the 9th house cause fear and defeat but the benefics Jupiter, Venus and Mercury placed in the 9th house confer victory on him.

*NOTES:* The king who invades from outside with full preparations is called af (lit one who goes). The king who isbeing invaded is termed स्थानीय् (one who resides).

Here the sage says that benefics in the 10th house give victory to the king who is attacked. Prithuyasas also says the same thing. Sloka 1 of chapter 3 of Shatpanchashika may be refered to in this context. Badarayan appears to differ here. He says:

उदयादेकादशगे भृगुबुधगुरुभास्करेषु चैकतरः ।  
नगराधिपस्य विजय करोति दशमे तथा भ्रंशम् ॥

The benefics in 10th house are not helpful to the king who is attacked according to Badarayana. Sanketa Nidhi says that if Sun, Saturn, Moon, Rahu and Mars be all in 7th house they would give success to the persons attacked. Sanketa 8 sloka 50 may be referred to.

नागराश्चक्रभागैस्तृतीयादितः प्रश्नलग्नाच्च धर्मादितो यायिनः ।  

तत्र सौम्येन जुष्टो जयप्राप्तिदःपापजुष्टस्तु भागो भवेदभंगभाक् ॥२ ॥

In the chart of query, the six houses beginning from the third belong to the स्थायिन् i.e., the king residing in the city who is being

attacked. The six houses beginning from the ninth belong to the यायिन् (the invader). The part conjoined with benefics gives victory to the party indicated by the same. The part containing malefics causes defeat to the corresponding party.

*NOTES :* The houses 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 represent स्थायिन् and houses 9, 10, 11 and 12 represent यायिन् ।

Rama Dayalu in his Sanketa Nidhi Sanket 8 Sloka 49 has also said the same thing.

भ्रातुः पौरा भाग्यतो यायिनः षड्भावाः सौम्या यत्र खेटा जयोऽस्य  

किन्त्वङ्गव्योमास्तभाग्येषु सर्वः सौम्यैः स्थायी सत्ववान्वैरिहन्ता ।

The six houses beginning from 3rd house from lagna relate to the citizens who are attacked called here the sthayee or the residents. If benefics be posited in these houses they indicate success to the residents or those who are attacked.

मिश्रयुक्ते विमिश्रं फलं निर्दिशेत्ताद्विरूपं फलं केचिदाचक्षते ।  
पंक्तिलाभव्ययस्थास्तु पापग्रहा यातुरिष्टाः परं तत्पुरस्याशुभाः ॥ ३ ॥

If both benefics and malefics are placed in these parts, mixed results are to be predicted. Some scholars state differently-malefics posited in 10, 11 and 12th houses cause benefic results to the यायिन् but produce malefic results to the स्थायिन् ।

*EXPLANATION:* The difference between Sloka 2 and 3 may

be noted.

मिथुनतुलाघटकन्यामेषाणामेककोऽपि पापयुतः ।  

यदि भवति तदा विजयो गन्तुः स्थास्नोर्भवेदभंग ॥४॥

Even if malefics are placed in anyone of the signs Gemini,Libra, Aquarius, Virgo and Aries, theयायिन् gets success and theस्थायिन् (one who is attacked) is defeated.

लग्ने नृशशिर्भवने यदि सन्ति सौम्याः  
केन्द्रव्ययायभवनेष्वशुभाभवन्ति ।  
सन्धिस्तदा द्रुततरं प्रवदेन्नराणां\।  
पापैर्द्विदेहगृहगैस्तु विरोधमाहुः ॥ ५ ॥

If there is a human sign on the ascendant and there are malefics in the quadrants, 12th house and 11th house the two parties will enter into treaty very soon. If malefics are placed in dual signs, enmity between the two parties will be the result.

*EXPLANATION:* Human signs are Gemini, Virgo, Libra and the first part of Sagittarius. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces are termed dual signs.

केन्द्रस्थिता यदि शुभा यदि वा भवन्ति  
लग्ने नृराशिभवने शुभदृष्टि पुष्टः ।  
प्रीतिस्ता भवति पापविलोकितैस्तु  
पापैरमीषु भवनेषु भवद्विरोधः ॥६॥

If there is a human sign on the ascendant and the same is aspected by benefics or if there are benefics in the quadrants there is enmity between the two parties. If on the said ascendant, there is malefic aspect or if there are malefic planets in those places, enmity between the two parties is the result.

अशुभग्रहस्थलग्ने बलिभिस्त्वशुभैश्च वीक्षिते युक्ते ।  

युद्धं महदादेश्यं शुद्रं सौम्यग्रहैर्दृष्टे ॥७॥

If there is a sign owned by a malefic on the ascendant and if the same is aspected or combined with malefics, a terrible war is to be predicted. If there be aspect of benefic planets over the same, he war will be a small one.

*NOTES:* In the absence of benefic aspects, the war may continue for a long time and otherwise it will be short-lived.

सूर्य समीरणसुरगुरुशुक्रान् समरे पृष्ठतःकृत्वा ।  

जयति परान्केवलमपिपरमफलंप्राह यवनेन्द्रः ॥ ८॥

The

Yavanacharya

has declared that keeping the Sun, Wind, Jupiter and Venus inthe back side one wins his enemies and attains fame.

*NOTES:* If the Sun were shining on the face, proper fighting will be difficult due to glare. Similarly, if wind were blowing right on

the face, it will be a great hindrance to fighting. So they are kept on the back side. Fuller information is to be sought from books on the science of war like "समरसार", "नरपतिजयचर्या" etc.

केन्द्रगमर्कंकेन्द्री यदि शनिरुद्वीक्षते तदा भंगः ।  
एवंविधशनिदृष्टे मृत्युगतेऽर्के भवेन्मृत्युः ॥ ९॥

If Saturn placed in quadrant, aspects Sun posited in another quadrant, the result is defeat. If the Sun be placed in the eighth house and is aspected by Saturn posited in a quadrant, death will be the result.

*NOTES:* Full aspect of Saturn from quadrant on the Sun placed in the eighth house is not possible. So Bhattotpala has suggested consideration of fractional aspect i.e. 1/4 aspect, 1/2 aspect and 3/4th aspect here.

![](../../../books_images/1684237137.jpg)

In these places, Saturn's 3/4 aspects over the Sun is possible.

![](../../../books_images/1684237263.jpg)

There is 1/2 aspect of Saturn over the Sun.

लग्ने रवावष्टमगे शशांके कुजार्कजाभ्यामवलोक्यमाने ।  
अर्कोऽष्टमे लग्नगते च चन्द्रे भंगो भवेत् प्रष्टुरसंशयेन

॥१०॥   

If the Sun is placed in the ascendant and the Moon is in the eighth house and if Mars and Saturn aspect them, defeat is certain to the querist. If the Moon is posited in the ascendant and the Sun is in the eighth house, aspected by Mars and Saturn, defeat would be the result.

जीवज्ञसूर्यभृगुजास्तनया हि लोक-  
दुश्चिक्यलग्नभवने परिपृच्छतः स्यु ।  
लाभस्थिताश्च शशिभास्करिभूमिपुत्रा  
यायी विजित्य रिपुमेति गृहं कृतार्थः ॥११॥

**Combination for the Victory of the Invader**: (यायिन् ): If at the time of query Jupiter, Mercury, the Sun and Venus be placed in the houses 5, 4, 3 and 1 and if the Moon, Saturn and Mars be placed in the eleventh house the invading king conquers the defendant स्थायिन् and carries booty etc.

*NOTE:* Prasna Vaishnava Chapter III, Sloka 2 also quotes thisrule.

लग्ने वा क्षितिसुतमंदयोः सुतस्थे  
जीवेऽर्के दशमगृहाश्रिते विलग्नात् ।  
लाभे वा नभसि सितेन्दुपुत्रयोर्वा  
प्रश्नैवं समिति रिपूंजययत्यवश्यम् ॥१२॥

If Mars or Saturn is placed in the ascendant, Jupiter in the 5th, Sun in the 10th, and Venus or Mercury in the 10th or 11th house, victory over the enemies is certain.

*NOTES:* Prasna Siromani and Prasna Vaishnava also give thisrule.

जीवतीव्रकरशीतमयूखैर्लग्नशत्रुदशगैर्जजसिद्धिः ।  
तद्वदेव गुरुभार्गवसूर्यैर्लग्नशत्रु दशगैरवधार्यम् ॥१३ ॥

If Jupiter, the Sun and the Moon are respectively placed in the ascendant, 6th house, and 10th house there will be success. In the same way, it should be understood that if Jupiter, Venus and the Sun are in the 1st house, 6th house and the 10th house, the person will have victory in war.

*NOTES*: A benefic of the nature of Jupiter is surely auspicious in the ascendant. Sun a malefic in the 6th house is definitely beneficial to win over enemies. Similarly benefics in the 10th house-a Kendra, prove definitely auspicious for getting success. This combination can be applied in the case of disputes, law-suits etc. also.

आये गुरौ स्यात्सचिवस्य लाभः कर्मस्थयोः सूर्यजभौमयोश्च ।  
चतुर्थगेज्ञेष्टमगे शशांके जायास्थिते चापि भृगौ जयः स्यात् ॥ १४ ॥

One will get an able minister or adviser if there is Jupiter in the 11th house and there are Saturn and Mars in the 10th house. If Mercury is placed in the 7th house, there will be victory.

*NOTES:* The acquisition of good minister is by no means less important for a king isgaining victory. Wise counsel sometimes accomplishes what cannot be achieved through mighty force. The combination is also useful in cases of elections, law-suits, sports, politics etc., where victory of one party over the other is to be decided.

दशमगेहगते क्षितिनन्दने किरणमालिनि लाभगृहं गते ।  
सहजगेऽर्कसुते रिपुगे विधौ तदितरैरुदयालयगैर्जयः ॥१५॥

लग्नशालिनि वा गुरौ विशुभैस्तु लाभगृहगतैः  
कर्मगैरथवा जयो भवतीति चाह पराशरः ॥१६॥

If Mars, the Sun and Saturn are placed in the 3rd house and there is a benefic in the ascendant the quesrist will have success.

Parasara bas declared that the placement of the Jupiter in the ascendant and a malefic in the 11th or 10th house produces victory.

क्षितिसुतसूर्यसुतौ यदि षष्ठे सुरगुरुचन्द्रमसौ च विलग्ने ।  
शशिसुतदैत्यगुरु यदि चाये दिवसकरो दशमश्च जयाय॥१७॥

If Mars and Saturn are placed in the 6th house and the Moon and Jupiter are placed in the ascendant with Mercury and Venus in the 11th house and the Sun in the 10th house, there is definite victory.

*NOTE:* The evil planets Mars and Saturn in the house of enemies in 6th render the enemy weak. Benefics in the ascendant render the native strong. Sun, a malefic, in the 10th house gets strength and is particularly favourable for attainment of success.

नवमात्मजलग्नगैरिह स्याच्छनिशीतांशुकुजैर्नृपस्य भंगः ।  
वसुधासुतदृष्टयोर्विलग्ने शशभृन्मन्दगयोर्भवेच्च मृत्युः ॥१८ ॥

**Defeat and Death in War:** The king will be defeated in war if the houses 9th, 5th and the 1st are respectively occupied by Saturn, the Moon and Mars. If the Moon and Saturn are placed in the ascendant aspected by Mars the king dies (in the war).

*NOTES:* It would be noted that when Moon and Saturn are in lagna there are three factors of longevity in the lagna i.e. the lagna the Chandra lagna and the significator of longevity i.e., Saturn. All these afflicted by Mars will naturally lead to death.

अष्टमे कुजयुते शनैश्चरे लग्नगे च मरणं दिवाकरे ।  
न्यायमृत्युषु च रोहिणीपतौस्याद्वधः समिति भास्करानुगे ॥ १६ ॥

**Other Combinations for Death in War:** If there be Mars and Saturn in the eighth house and the Sun in the ascendant death results. Similarly, if the Sun and the Moon occupy anyone of the places 3rd, 11th or the 8th there will be death in war.

कुजबुधशनिभिः स्मरस्थितैर्भवति रिपूनथ गच्छतो वधः ।  
उदयगृहगयोः सितारयोरपि च रिपूपचयः क्षुधा मृतिः ॥ २०॥

If Mars, Mercury and the Moon occupy the 7th house the king who goes on expedition to conquer dies. If Venus and Mars are placed in the ascendant enemies will increase in number and death from hunger results to the party attacked.

विज्ञेयाः क्षितिसुतमन्दयोर्विलग्ने षष्ठक्षे बुधसितयोरिहाष्टमक्षें ।  
तीक्ष्णांशोर्ध्रुवमिति पापिनो रिपुणां संग्रामे पटुतरमन्त्रिणो वधाय ॥२१ ॥

If there is a sign belonging to Mars or Saturn on the ascendant, and in the 6th house there is a sign belonging to Mercury or Venus and in the eighth house there is the sign belonging to the Sun, and if these places are occupied by malefics, in that war an intelligent minister of the king dies in the battle.

*NOTES:* This combination is possible when Capricorn rises as the ascendant.

विलग्नात्मजस्थानसंस्थैरवश्यं वधंप्रष्टपुत्रस्य जानीहि पापैः ।  
चन्द्रे कुजे लग्नगे सौरिदृष्टे पुनः संगरे भंग एवं प्रदिष्टः ॥ २२ ॥

If there are malefics in the ascendant and the 5th house, the son of the qurist surely dies. If the Moon occupies the ascendant along with Mars, and if they are aspected by Saturn he will be defeated in war.

द्यूननैधनगते सितद्युतौ लग्नगामिनि च तीक्ष्णदीधितौ।  
गच्छतः समिति वा विपर्यये त्रासभंगमरणागमा ध्रुवम् ॥ २३ ॥

If the Moon occupies the 7th or the 8th house and the Sun is placed in the ascendant or if the Sun occupies the 7th or 8th house and the Moon is the ascendant the king (who goes to conquer his enemies) and his army meets with fear, defeat and death.

*NOTES:* विपर्यय = the reverse of the combination would be Moon in the ascendant with the Sun in the 7th or the 8th house.

द्वित्रिकेन्द्रस्थितैः पापरूपैर्ग्रहैः-  
शक्तिहानिं वहद्भिःस्वकीयांशुभिः ।  
अष्टमस्थे निशानायके भूभुजां  
बन्धनाशात्ययाः स्यूरणे पृच्छताम् ॥२४ ॥

If weak and eclipsed malefics are placed in the 2nd, 3rd and angular houses with the Moon in the 8th house then the king putting the query will be either captured or will be killed.

द्यूने महीनन्दनचन्द्रयोः स्याद् बुधोऽर्कलग्ने स्वबलस्य भेदः ।  
यमारयोस्तद्वदवेहि भंगं युद्धे बुधाहस्करयोस्तथैव ॥ २५ ॥

If Mars and the Moon occupy the 7th house and the Sun and Mercury are placed in the ascendant, there will be rift in the army. Similarly, if Saturn and Mars are placed in the 7th house and in the ascendant Mercury and Venus are placed, then also there will be quarrels in the army leading to defeat.

सर्वैरमीभिर्नवमस्थितैस्तु हन्यान्नृपो मन्त्रिपुरोहितादीन् ।  
अत्रैव योगे च शशी विलग्ने सदेशिकाश्वस्थपतिस्वपुत्रान् ॥ २६ ॥

If all these planets (the Sun, Mars, Saturn and Mercury told in the previous sloka) be placed in the ninth house the king kills his minister and preceptor. In this very combination if the Moon is placed in the ascendant the king kills his preceptors, horses, artists, craftsmen and his sons.

*NOTES:* The king grows suspicious, suspects treason on the part of these people and therefore kills them.

अर्कसूर्यसुतयोश्च विलग्ने दृष्टयोश्वधरणीतनयेन ।  
अस्तगे राशधरे बलहीनैर्वाहिनीपतिवधः किल सौम्यैः ॥ २७ ॥

If the Sun and Saturn placed in the ascendant receive the aspect of Mars and the Moon is placed in the 7th house and all the benefics are weak, the Commander-in-Chief of the king will be killed.

अस्तगे शशिना लग्नगे रवावष्टमे कुजशनैश्वरौयदा ।  
ज्ञस्तृतीयगृहगस्तदा रणे मन्त्रिणा सह विहन्यते नृपः ॥ २८ ॥

If the Moon is placed in the 7th house with the Sun in the ascendant, Saturn and Mars in the 8th house and Mercury is placed in third house, the king and his minister are killed in the war.

शीर्षोदयंशुभसुहृद्ग्रहयुक्तदृष्टं  
लग्नं शुभा बलयुताः शुभवर्गलग्ने ।  

सर्वार्थसिद्धिदमतोऽन्यदनिष्टमेव  
प्रस्थानजन्मफलयुक्तिभिरन्यदूह्यम् ॥ २६ ॥

If a sirshodaya sign rises on the ascendant aspected by or conjoined with benefics and friendly planets and if strong benefics occupy the ascendant in the varga of benefics all things are accomplished. Under a reverse combination evil ensues. Other things may be considered with reference to the ascendant of travel and the natal horoscope.

*NOTES:* The reverse of the combination would be: If a Pristhodaya sign rises on the ascendant conjoined with or aspected by malefic planets or strong malefics occupy ascendant in the shadvarga of evil planets his desires will not be fulfilled (यात्रा मुहूर्त) but proves

evil to him.

**Recovery from Diseases  
रोगशुभाध्यायः**

लग्नस्थितो वाऽष्टमसंस्थितो वा पापग्रहो यस्य तु जन्मराशिम् ।  
निरीक्षते तस्य गदार्दितस्य निःसंशयं मृत्युमुदाहरन्ति ॥ १ ॥

If a malefic is situated in the ascendant or the 8th house and aspects the sign occupied by Moon in the natal chart of the patient that patient surely dies.

*NOTES :* **लग्नं वैद्यो द्यूनं व्याधिः खं रोगी तुर्यमौषधम्** । According to this dictum, the ascendant represents the physician, the 7th house represents the disease, the 10th house the patient and the 4th house the medicine.

पृष्ठोदये विलग्ने क्रूराः केन्द्रेऽष्टगः शशी यत्त्य ।  
रोगार्तस्य विनाशो दृष्टे वा बलयुतैः पापैः ॥२ ॥

If there is a pristhodaya sign on the ascendant, malefics occupy quadrants, the Moon is in the eighth house, that patient dies. If strong malefics aspect the ascendant and the Moon then the patient dies.

*NOTES :* Pristhodaya signs are: Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius and Capricorn. Rise of a pristhodaya sign does not allow the object to materialise easily. It spoils it. Moon in the eighth house produces troubles and discases.

Also according to the rule "लग्नेन्द्वोर्वक्तव्यंशुभदष्ट्या शोभनमतोन्यत्" i.e., if there is benefic aspect on the ascendant and the Moon, auspicious results are to be told. But if they both have malefic aspect, the results will be different i.e. they will be bad.

शशिनं शशिपुत्रं वा पश्यति पापो विलग्नगेहस्थम् ।  
आदेष्टव्यः प्रष्टुः कष्टो व्याधिर्न संदेहः ॥ ३ ॥

If the ascendant is occupied by the Moon or Mercury aspected

by malefics, troubles and hardships are to be foretold to the querist.

सौम्यग्रहा यदि सुतस्मरमृत्युसंस्थाः  
पापा भवन्ति च शुभग्रहदृश्यमानाः ।  
आयत्रिषड्दशमगश्च निशाकरः स्यात्  
तस्माच्छुभाश्च यदि वा शुभमाहुरस्य ॥४ ॥

If benefics occupy the 5th, 7th and 8th houses and there is aspect of benefic planets over the malefics and the Moon occupies 11th, 3rd, 6th or 10th houses and there are benefics in the same places counted from the Moon, the patient recovers.

पापेक्षितः पापयुतः शुभानां दृग्योगहीनो नवमः शनिश्येत् ।  
तदा रुजार्तः परदेशगः स्यात् षष्ठाष्टमे मृत्युकरस्त्ववश्यम् ॥५ ॥

If Saturn placed in the ninth house is combined with or aspected by malefics and it is not having conjunction and aspect of benefic planets, the patient goes to some foreign country. If such a Saturn is in the 6th or 8th house, the patient surely dies.

उपचयगृहगे चन्द्रे शुभेषु केन्द्रत्रिकोणनिधनेषु ।  
शुभदृष्टे वा लग्ने रोगी देशान्ते नीरुक् ॥ ६ ॥

If the Moon is situated in an Upachayasthana and there are benefics situated in quadrants, trines and the eighth house or if there is aspect of benefic planets over the ascendant the patient recovers after going to a different place.

लग्नगतः परिपूर्णो रजनिजानिर्विलोकितो गुरुणा ।  
केन्द्रे वा गुरुभृगुजौ रोगार्तस्तत्र नीरोगः ॥७॥

If there is Full Moon in the ascendant getting the aspect of Jupiter or if Jupiter and Venus are placed in quadrants the patient is cured.

प्रश्नश्चेत्स्थिरलग्ने तदा न मरणं न रोगशान्तिर्वा ।  
चरलग्ने विपरीतं द्विदेहलग्ने तु पूर्वमिव॥८॥

If there is a fixed sign on the ascendant, death does not take place and the disease is also not cured. In a movable ascendant the result is reverse. In a dual sign the result is similar to that of a fixed sign.

*NOTES:* It would be relevant as well as more helpful to give certain general guidelines also. In any horary chart Moon has his own importance and the same cannot be overlooked. In the judgement of the question special attention should be paid to (a) the position of Moon (b) the position of the house and its lord concerned with the answer and (c) the lagna and its lord. While judging the question of recovery from illness the important considerations are:

\(a\) Position of lagna. It should neither be occupied nor afflicted by malefics if we want to have happy results. Lagna lord is never a malefic.

\(b\) Position of Moon. It should not be a waning Moon nor an afflicted Moon.

\(c\) Moon's occupation, particularly of waning Moon, of house 6, 8 and 12 is inauspicious for the health and recovery of the native.

\(d\) Ascedant lord should be strong and should be free from evil influences.

\(e\) Position of the 8th house and the 8th lord.

Apart from the above our experience shows that in my consideration the badhaka lords are the worst malefics. They are worse than even the death inflicting planets. They are dealt with in some details in the "Judgement on Longevity" which may be referred

to.

**Lost Articles  
नष्टलाभाऽलाभा**

स्थिरोदये वा यदि वा स्थिरांशे वर्गोत्तमे वा यदि वा विलग्ने ।  
तत्रैव तच्चोरितमस्ति वस्तु स्वकेन केनापि चरे परैस्तु ॥१ ॥

If there is a fixed sign, fixed Navamsha, or Vargothama 'Navamsha in the ascendant the article stolen is in the same place and surely a person known to the querist has stolen it. If there is a movable sign or navamsha on the ascendant some external person has stolen it.

*NOTES:* Vide Shatpanchashika Chapte 6 sloka 1, and Prasna jnana Sloka 54.

द्विशरीरराशिलग्ने प्रतिवेशिजनेन इतमुदाहार्यम् ।  
तत्रस्थ स्थिरराशी चरराशी तच्च संचलितम् ॥ २ ॥

If there is a dual sign on the ascendant, some neighbour has stolen the article-Thus it should be predicted. If a fixed sign rises the article is there itself. But if a movable sign rises, it has gone elsewher.

लग्ने प्रजाते द्वितनी हतं स्वं गृहाद्वहिर्निर्गमित विचिन्त्यम् ।  
हर्ता सवीस्तगखेटतुल्यो नीजे नृदृष्टे दयितऽन्यथातः ॥ ३ ॥

If a dual sign rises the stolen article has gone outside the house. The caste, colour, qualities and form of the thief will correspond to the nature of the strongest planet placed in the 7th house. If it is in an odd sign there and there is under aspect of a male planet, the thief is a male otherwise a female.

लग्नांशकादपहृतद्रविणस्यजाति  
द्वेष्काणतस्तदपहर्तृजनस्वरूपम् ।  

दिग्देशकालकलनं किल राशितः स्या-  
लग्नांशकाद्भवति जातिवयोविभागः ॥४ ॥

From the Navamsha in which the ascendant falls, the nature of the lost article is judged. From the decanate rising, the form of the thief should be judged. From the rising sign, direction (where the theft has occurred), place and the time of theft are to be judged.

Regarding the place where the lost article has moved or has been taken by the thief the Sanketa Nidhi says that

\(i\) If Prasna lagna and navamsa fall in a fixed sign the article has been stolen by some relation who is in the same house or living near by. He is not an outsider and as such the article has been hidden either in the same house or at some near place.

\(2\) If the ascendant and navamsa fall in a movable sign the thief is not a relative but a known person to the querist and the article has been taken or hidden at a distant place.

\(3\) If the ascendant and navamsa fall in a dual sign the thief is an outsider but not an unknown person. The lost article is hidden at a place which is not very far from the house.

Sage Badarayana in this regard says that the lost article does not go very far away from the house if benefics occupy the 2nd or 3rd or fourth house counted from the lagna of the horary chart.

Here the ascendant denotes the querist and the 7th house the thief. Because the house is 2nd to the 7th it denotes the article stolen.

Prasna Marga says that the colour etc., of the thief is to be judged from the decanate of the lagna and the lord of that decanate. Sloka 6 of Chapter 29 refers. Accending to Arya Saptati the appearance of the thief should be judged from the lagna lord. This is perhaps on the analogy that in the case of medical treatment the lagna represents the doctor treating the patient. Acharya Madhava says that the 6th house stands for the thief and as such that house and planets influencing that house should explain the physical appearance and other details of the thief.

NOTES: The same is written by Prithuyasas in his Shatpanchashika in the meter of an Anushtup ideaअंशका

ज्झायतेद्रव्यंद्रेष्काणैस्तस्कराः स्मृताः राशिभ्यः कालदिग्देशा वयजातिश्व लग्नपात्' । This requires elaborate explanation. We follow Bhattotpala in the interpretation of this verse.

The stolen property, whether it is a mineral (धातु), root (मूल) or animal kind (जीव)is decided from the rising Navamsha. The method is given in the next chapter under slokas 9 and 10. It is like this. If a planet occupying a Navamsha of his own should aspect his own Navamsha in the Lagna, 5th or 9th house, the query relates to a mineral. If the aspecting planet occupies the Amsha of another, the matter relates to animal kind. If the aspecting planet be in another's Navamsha and aspect the Navamsha of another the matter relates to some root or vegetable kind. Colour and size of the article can also be judged from the rising Navamsha. The colours are: red, white, green, pink, grey, variegated, dark, brown, mixed tawny and soiled respectively for the planets from Sun to Saturn.

अरुणसित हरितपाटल विचित्राः सितेतर पिशङ्गौ ।  
पिङ्गल कर्बुरबभ्रुकमलिना रुचयो यथासंख्यम् ॥

(लघुजातकम्)

**The size of the stolen article:** The navamsha signs Kumbha, Meena, Mesha and Vrishabha indicate shortness. Mithuna, Karka, Dhanu, and Makara are of medium length. Simha, Vrischika, Kanya and Tula are long.

If the lord of the rising Navamsha is strong, the lost article is a costly thing. If he is weak, it is valueless, chcap or useless.

**Form of the thief:** From the decanate rising the form of the thief is to be judged. In the drekkanadhyaya of Brihat Jataka are told the forms of the 36 drekkanas. From this, the form of the thief can be decided.

**Time of theft.** If Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Dhanus or Capricorn rise, theft has occurred during night. If any other sign rises, theft has occurred during day time.

Seeजातकपारिजात 1-10-12 in this connection for details.

The age and the caste of the thief are to be guessed from the nature of the lord of the ascendant. His age will be according to the

following rule:

Moon-suckling

child, Mars-boy, Mercury- celibate,

Venus-young

man,

Jupiter-middle aged,

Sun-old man,

Saturn-very old man.

वयांसि तेषां स्तनपानवाल्वव्रतस्थिता यौवन मध्यवृद्धाः ।  
अतीव वृद्धा इति चन्द्रभौमङ्गशुक्रजीवार्कशनैश्चराणाम् ॥ ५ ॥

The ages of the planets the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Sun and Saturn are respectively those of: (1) suckling child (2) boy (3) celibate (ब्रह्मचारी) (4) young man (5) middle aged person (6) old man (7) and a very old man.

*NOTES:* Roughly we can give estimates of age in years as below the Moon- below 4 years. Mars-4 to 8 years. Mercury-8 to 16 years. Venus 16 to 30 years. Jupiter-30 to 50 years, Sun-50 to 70 years and Saturn-70 and above,

The age of the thief will be equal to that assigned to the lord of the Navamsha in which the ascendant falls.

रवीन्दुयुक्ते शनिभीमदृष्टे सिंहोदकेन्धः किलतस्करः स्यात् ।  
वामेन काणः शशिनि व्ययस्थे स चक्षुषइन्येन रवी व्ययस्ये ॥ ६ ॥

If the ascendant falls in the sign Leo, and the Sun and the Moon are placed therein, and if the same is aspected by Saturn and Mars the thief will be blind. If weak Moon is placed in the 12th house, his left eye will be blind and if the weak Sun is placed in the 12th house, his right eye will be blind.

क्रूरः षष्ठः क्रूरराशी विलग्नाद्यस्मिन्द्राशी तत्प्रदेशे व्रणोऽस्य ।  
एवं प्रोक्तं यन्मया जन्मकाले चिन्हं रूपं तत्तदस्मिन्विधेयम् ॥ ७ ॥

If a malefic is placed in the 6th house in the limb represented by its sign or the Bhava where a malefic is placed injury is to be foretold. And whatever has been told by me at the time of birth,

regarding moles, marks and forms all that is to be suitably used here

in this enquiry.

NOTES: The word‘यन्मया जन्मकाले’seems to point out to whatever Varaha Mihira has

told in the Chapter Janma

Vidhanadhyaya in his celebrated work Brihat Jatakam.

आद्यो हृतं निपतितं तदनु द्वितीये  
द्रव्यं च विस्मृतमथो यदि वा तृतीये ।  
द्रेष्काणकेषुपरिकल्प्यमिदंक्रमेण  
वाच्यं हृतं तदपि वेश्ममुखेऽन्तरेऽन्त्ये॥८॥

If the ascendant falls in the first decanate (0° to 10°) the article has been stolen. In second decanate, it indicates that the article has fallen somewhere. The third decanate, indicates that the person has kept the article somewhere and then forgotten. Thus it is to be guessed. Even if lost, it is within the house and has not gone out of the door when the third decanate rises.

ग्रहैर्दिशः केन्द्रगतैर्विचिन्त्या विलग्नराशेस्तदसम्भवे वा ।  
विलग्नमध्याच्चलितैर्नवांशैर्विचिन्तनीयानि हि योजनानि ॥ ६ ॥

The direction where the stolen article has gone is to be told from the planet placed in the quadrants. If it is not possible, the direction is to be told from the sign of the ascendant. The distance is to be told from the number of Navamsha elapsed, country from the 5th Navamsha in the lagna. This number will give the distance in Yojana. One yojana may be taken roughly as equal to a mile.

NOTES: According to Madhava the direction of the lost article is indicated by the sign in the lagna of the horary chart if the lagna is strong. In case the lagna is weak the article can be found in the direction represented by the planet aspecting the lagna. If the sign in the lagna is a movable sign the lost article is in motion and if it be a fixed sign the article has reached its destination (through the thief).

शुक्रे धने देवगुरौ व्ययस्थे मूर्तौ शुभे वा

हतलब्धिरुक्ता ।  
होरेन्दुयुक्तालयदिङ्मुखेषु सूर्येण लग्नाधिपराशिभूमौ ॥१० ॥



If there is Venus in the second house and Jupiter in the 12th house with a benefic in the ascendant the stolen article is got back. If the Moon is in the ascendant, it is got in the direction of the sign of the ascendant and if the Sun is in the ascendant it is got in the direction of the ascendant.

पूर्णः शशी यदि विलग्नगतः शुभो वा  
शीर्षोदये यदि पुनः शुभदृष्टिदृष्टः ।  
लाभस्थितो बलयुतो यदि वा शुभः स्यात्  
नष्टस्य लाभमचिरेण ततः करोति ॥११॥

If there is full Moon in the ascendant or query or if there is a benefic in a Sirshodaya rasi aspected by a benefic or if there is a very strong benefic in the eleventh house, the lost article is got back quickly.

लग्नाद्द्वितीये यदि वा तृतीये शुभेन युक्ते हिबुकेऽथवा स्यात् ।  
सौम्यैः सुहृत्सप्तदशस्थितैर्वा निःसंशयं चोरितवस्तुलाभः॥१२ ॥

If there be a benefic in the second, third, or fourth house or if the same be in the fourth, seventh and the tenth houses, the stolen article is got back without any doubt.

लग्ने सम्पूर्णतनुजीवेन सितेन वीक्षितश्चन्द्रः ।  
केन्द्रोपचयस्यै वा यदि सौम्यैः स्वोपचयगैराप्ति॥ १३॥

If full Moon be posited in the ascendant and if it is aspected by Jupiter or Venus or if benefics be placed in quadrants and upachayasthanas ( 3, 6, and 11 ) or if benefics be placed in the second and Upachayasthanas the stolen articles are got back.

लग्ने पूर्णश्चन्द्रो जीवः शुक्रो बुधोऽपि वा भवति ।  
लभतेऽपद्धतं द्रव्यं शुभयुक्ते सप्तमे यदि वा ॥१४॥

If full Moon, Jupiter, Venus or Mercury is placed in the as cendant, the stolen article is got back. Or if benefics are placed in the seventh house, the stolen article is got back.

लग्नात्पातालाद्वा द्वितीयस्थोऽथवा तृतीयस्थः \।  
भवति शुभग्रहश्चेन्नूनं प्रश्ने नष्टं धनं लभते ॥१५ ॥

If there is a benefic in the 2nd or 3rd house from the ascendant or from the 4th house the stolen article is got back definitely.

NOTES: This means, there should be a benefic in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or 6th house from the ascendant of query.

पापविलग्नं पापे पश्यति नष्टं विनष्टमेव स्यात् ।  
शुभखगलग्ने तु शुभैईष्टे नष्टाप्तिरेष्टव्या ॥१६॥

If the ascendant of query falls on the sign of a malefic, aspected by a malefic the stolen article will not be got back. If on the ascendant there is a benefic, aspected by another benefic, the stolen aritcle will be definitely got back.

सिंहालिकुम्भा यदि पाप विक्षिता युताः समस्थाः स्वनवांशगामिनः ।  
तदा विनष्टं त्वथवा बलान्विते कुजोऽष्टमस्थे यदि तन्नवांशे ॥१७ ॥

If the 7th house falls in the signs Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarius and these signs contain in their own Navamshas and if the 7th house is aspected by malefics the article will not be got back. Or if Mars is placed in the 8th house in these Navamshas, the lost article will not be got back.

मनोमुष्टिचिन्ताध्यायः**

लग्नस्थ राशिबुधवीक्षितः सुधांशुश्चान्द्रिर्वा  

कथयति चिन्तितां कुमारीम् ।  

वृद्धां स्त्रीं शनिरिनगीपती प्रसूतां  
शुक्रारावथ तरुणीं नकेपि चैवम् ॥ १ ॥

If on the ascendant the Moon or Mercury is situated and if there is the aspect of the Moon or Mercury on the ascendant the querist is thinking about some girl. If Saturn is placed in the ascendant, the querist is thinking about an old woman. The Sun and Jupiter similarly placed indicate a middle-aged woman while Venus and Mars would indicate a young woman. If the query relates to a male, these combinations have to be interpreted as indicating boy, old man, middle-aged man and a young man.

Prithuyasas has also said the same thing in his Shatpanchashika. Chapter 7 sloka 6 may be referred. Generally Prithuyasas has always said what Varahamihira has said. This is so perhaps because the former is the son and the latter the father. Father in earlier days was also the preceptor and that is why anything about the father is considered from the 9th house.

अस्ते सितार्करविजैः परकीयजाया  

स्वीया गुरौ शशिनि तत्तनये च वेश्या ।  

वाच्या वयश्च शशिवत्परिचिन्तनीय  
सौरेन्त्यजातिरितरैरपि चिन्तिता स्यात् ॥२ ॥

If Venus, the Sun and Saturn are placed on the 7th house, the thought is about the wife of another person. Jupiter indicates one's own wife. Moon or Mercury would show a courtesan. Saturn, Rahu or Ketu will show that the query is regarding a woman belonging to a low caste. From the degree of the Moon, the age of the woman under query is to be judged.

*NOTES:* If the Moon is placed from 1ºto 6º a small girl is indicated. From 7º to12º a girl of 14 years. From 13° to 18º a young woman. From 18º to 25º a middle-aged woman and from 25º to 30º the Moon indicates a very old woman.

लग्ने ग्रहैरात्मसमो बलस्यैर्भ्राता तृतीयैस्तनयः सुतस्यैः ।  
माता चतुर्थैरथवा स्वसा स्याच्छत्रुस्थितैः शत्रुगतैव चिन्ता ॥३॥

The query relates to one's own self, brother, son, mother, sister or enemy according as the planet endowed with strength is situated in the ascendant, third house, fifth house, fourth house or the sixth house.

भार्या भवेत्सप्तमगैरमीभिर्धर्मःश्रितो धर्मसमाश्रितैश्च ।  
खस्थैर्गुरुः स्वांशपमित्रशत्रुस्थानेषु तद्वद्बलवत्सु वाच्यम् ॥४ ॥

The query is concerning one's wife, religion or proceptor, according as the strong planet is placed in the 7th, 9th or 10th house. The strength of the planet is to be guessed from its placement in own Navamsha, Navamsha of a friendly planet or the Navamsha of an inimical planet.

*NOTES:* Here a method is given for the strength of the planet to be judged from its Navamsha position. A planet is considered weak when posited in the Navamsha of a debilitated or inimical planet.

भागे चरे चरविलग्नगते च मध्याद्  

भ्रष्टप्रवासविषया भवतीह चिन्ता ।  

भ्रष्टः स चेद्भवति सप्तमतस्तवा तु  
व्यावर्तते यदि न वक्रगतो ग्रहकेसी ॥ ५ ॥

If on the ascendant, there rises a movable sign or the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Navamshas of a chara rasi, the query in the mind is regarding life abroad. If any planet moves further away from the 7th house and returns to the 7th house with retrograde motion, the person who has gone abroad will return. If the planet is not retrograde the person will not return.

*NOTES:* If the planet which moves away from the 7th house, does not come back with retrograde motion the person will not return.

This Chapter is about the questions that exist in the mind of querent and not spelt out by him. Such questions are called the Manasa Prasna (Question in the mind), Mooka Prasna (Silent question) or the Nashta prasna (questions that are not spelt out).

According to Prasna Marga the indication of the question is to be judged from the planets and their placement in the following

manner :

1\. If the lagna is occupied by the Jupiter or Moon the question relates to longevity.

2\. If Saturn is located in the 12th, 8th or 7th house the question is about theft.

3\. If Jupiter occupies the Prasna lgna, Venus the lagna or Mercury the 10th house the question relates to completion of some work already undertaken.

4\. The question relates to loss or theft of wealth if a natural malefic occupies a quadrant or 6th house from lagna or Aroodha lagna or Moon sign.

Neelakantha has dealt with this in a more scientific way. He has classified the questions into three categories according to the nature. It may pertain to Jeeva or Moola or Dhatu. The astrologer has to classify the question first. Jeeva, Moola and Dhatu may be interpreted in English as living beings, roots and minerals respectively. Some of the combinations are given below:

1\. If strong Sun and Mars occupy the quadrants the query is about Dhatu.

2\. If a strong Saturn happens to occupy a quadrant the subject is about Moola.

3\. If strong Moon, Jupiter and Venus are in quadrants the subject of the query is Jeeva.

4\. If Aries, Scorpio or Leo happens to be the lagna and occupied by Mars or Sun the worry is about Dhatu.

5\. If Mercury Conjoined with Saturn aspects Gemini, Aquarius or Virgo happening to be the lagna the worry is about Moola.

6\. If conjoined Moon, Jupiter and Venus aspect the lagna which happen to be Taurus Libra, Leo, Pisces, Cancer or Sagittarius the worry is about Jeeva.

7\. The cause of worry is indicated by the house occupied by Moon counted from ascendant lord or the eleventh lord who-so-ever is stronger of the two.

There are other combinations and indications of planets also. They are all very similar to the ones given here.

|            |      |           |         |
|:----------:|:----:|:---------:|:-------:|
|           | Mars | Sun Venus |        |
|           |     |          |        |
|  Sat (R)   |     |          | jup (R) |
| Rahu Ascdt |     |   Moon    |        |

The method devised by Krishnamurti depends upon the position of Moon, who is also identified as Mathi or mind. Representing the mind of the querist the position of Moon in the horary chart discloses the question. As this is slightly off the traditional track the case can better be explained by an example. The horary chart is as under: Moon representing the mind of the querent is the 8th lord. He stands both for debts as well as the in-fighting. He

aspects the 5th house as well as its lord Mars. The house and its lord indicate the luck. Further, Moon occupies the 10th house in the Bhava chart. This house is the house of profession. If we take them all together we get the picture of the question very clearly. The querent is concerned with some worry of profession.

Perhaps he wants to start some project. He may have to take some persons as his partners. The 7th house being Gemini and its lord Mercury indicate business. It is significant that both the ascendant and the 7th house are afflicted by Rahu and Ketu respectively. All this clearly indicates that there is some proposal to take loan and float some new company with some persons as partners. The querent wanted to know about its ultimate regult on the luck of the querent. When he was asked the question he said that he proposed to start some undertaking and wanted to know how luck would favour him. The question was justified by Moon. More details can be obtained if we go deeper still in the question of Constellations and their lords. Here it will suffice to say how Moon can indicate the nature of the question or even the cause of worry.

दीर्घास्तुलालिमृगनायककन्यकाः स्यु-  
मध्या धनुर्मकरकर्कटयुग्मसंज्ञाः ।  
हस्वारच मेचवृषमीनघटाः प्रदिष्टा  
वस्तुप्रमाणमपि राशिसमानमेव ॥ ६॥

The signs Libra, Scorpio, Leo and Virgo are long. Sagittarius, Capricorn, Cancer and Gemini are of medium length. Aries Taurus, Pisces and Aquarius are short. The length (or size) of an article is to be predicted from the length of the respective signs.

रक्तौ सूर्यमहीसुतौ शशिसितौ श्वेतौ साधुदीधितेः

सूर्यः स्याच्चतुरस्रकः क्षितिसुतो वृतस्तथा रन्धवान्  
सौम्यो दीर्घतनुस्तथा शशधरो दीर्घाकृतिः सुन्दरः॥ ७॥

The Sun and Mars are red in colour. The Moon and Venus are white. Mercury is green. Jupiter is yellow and Saturn is black.

जीवो वृत्तवपुः सितस्त्वतिकृशः सौरिश्च दीर्घाकृतिर्मध्ये  
रन्धसमन्वितश्च कथितं रूपं ग्रहाणामिदम् ।  
इत्येवं कृतचिंतितादिविषयप्रश्नेषु वर्णाकृती  
द्रव्यस्यापि बलान्वितग्रहवशान्निःसंशयः निर्दिशेत् ॥ ८॥

The Sun is square in form, Mars is round. Mercury is tall. TheMoon is also tall. Jupiter is round. Venus is thin. Saturn has a long form. Thus has been told the forms and shapes of the planets. In the case of silent queries, the shape, colour and form of the article is to be divined from the shape, colour and form of the strongest planet at the moment of query.

लग्ने वाभ्युदितं त्रिकोणभवने स्वांश निजांशस्थितो  

यः कश्चिद्ग्रह ईक्षतेतदिह वा स्याद्धातुचिन्ता ध्रुवम् ।  
अन्यांशेसमवस्थितः पुनरसौ जीवस्य चिन्ताकरो  
मूलस्यापि परांशके परिगतः पश्यन् परांश ग्रहः॥ ९॥

**Query regarding mineral, vegetable or animal:** If a planet situated in its own Navamsa aspects its own Navamsa falling in the ascendant or a triangular house or is placed therein the query is relating to a mineral (धातु) and this is certain. If the planet be situated in the Navamsa belonging to another planet but aspects its own Navamsa, falling on the ascendant or a triangular house, the query concerns a living being (जीव). If the planet is placed in the Navamsa of another planet and is aspecting the Navamsa of another planet falling on the ascendant or a triangular house, the query relates to a vegetable (मूल).

*Notes:* Please refer to Navamsa Prasna Chapter in the Tajika Neelakanthi.

विद्याद्ग्रहे तु विषमे किल धातुमूलजीवान्  
समे तु विपरीतमिदं विचिन्त्यम् ।  
लग्नांशकक्रमवशाद्गणनीयमेवं  
संक्षेप एष विवृतिस्त्वतिचिन्तनेन ॥१०॥

If the planet is placed in an odd sign the Navamsas denote query about mineral, vegetable and animal respectively. If the planet is posited in an even sign, this should be considered in the reverse order i.e., the first Navamsa represent, animals, the second vegetables and the third minerals. This in short is the method to be adopted in silent queries.

|      |      |     |           |           |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---------:|:---------:|
|     |     |    | Odd sign  |          |
| 1st, | 4th, | 7th |  Navamsa  |  mineral  |
| 2nd  | 5th  | 8th |  Navamsa  | vegetable |
| 3rd  | 6th  | 9th |  Navamsa  |  animal   |
|     |     |    | Even sign |          |
| 1st, | 4th, | 7th |  Navamsa  |  animal   |
| 2nd  | 5th  | 8th |  Navamsa  | vegetable |
| 3rd  | 6th  | 9th |  Navamsa  |  mineral  |

The correct judgement needs intellegence, ingenuity and

maturity.

बलिनौ भास्करभौमौ धातुकरौ संस्थिती प्रश्ने ।  
मूलकरी शनिसौम्यी शशिगुरुभृगुजास्तथा जीवाः ॥११ ॥

If the Sun and Mars are strong, they indicate a query regarding some mineral. If the Saturn or Mercury is strong, the query relates to vegetables. If the Moon, Jupiter and Venus are strong the query is regarding some animal.

मेषे सिंह वृश्चिके वा विलग्ने भौमार्काभ्यामन्विते वीक्षिते वा ।  
धातोरिचन्तां सौरिचन्द्रात्मजाभ्यां मूलं युग्मे कुम्भकन्यामृगेषु ॥१२ ॥

If Aries, Leo or Scorpio rises as ascendant and the same is conjoined with or aspected by Mars or the Sun, the query relates to some mineral. If Gemini, Virgo, Capricorn or Aquarius rises as ascendant and the same is conjoined to or aspected by Saturn or Mercury the query relates to a vegetable.

मीनकर्कवृषचापतौलिभिश्चन्द्रशुक्रगुरुभिर्युतेक्षितैः ।  
जीवमाहुरिति मिश्रितं धनं मिश्रितग्रहयुतेक्षणात्तथा ॥१३॥

If Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius, Libra or Pisces rises as ascendant and the same is conjoined with or aspected by the Moon, Venus and Jupiter the query will be concerning some animal. If planets of different kinds conjoin or aspect the ascendant, the query will be concerning mixture of the corresponding categories. (i.e. mineral, vegetable, and animal).

relating to objects held in the mind or in the Fist."



ELEVENTH

**Queries regarding Rains  
वृष्टिनिर्णयः**

चन्द्रार्कयोः शनिसितौ यदि सप्तमस्थौ  
तुर्येऽष्टमे च भवतो यदि वा विलग्नात्  
स्यातां धने च सहजे यदि सौ विलग्ना–  
वर्षासु वर्षमचिरेण तदा विधत्तः ॥ १॥

If Saturn and Venus happen to be placed in the 7th house from the Sun and the Moon or in the 4th or 8th houses from the ascendant or in the 2nd or 3rd house from the ascendant rain-fall occurs immediately without any delay, during the rainy season.

*NOTES:* If the query is put during rainy season, and if the said combinations occur, rainfall is to be predicted without any delay.

It may be noted that the maximum distance to which Venus can go away from Sun is 48 degrees. It is never possible for Venus to be in the 7th house from Sun or in opposition to Sun.

According to sage Badarayana Sun, Mars and Saturn are dry planets, Moon and Venus are watery planets and Jupiter and Mercury become watery if they are posited in watery signs or are conjoined with the watery planets. According to Dr. Suresh Chandra Mishra the planets Jupiter and Mercury are taken to be watery planets only when they are posited in watery signs or are conjoined with watery planets. This is so because they are not without water though they are not watery

पक्षे सिते सलिलराशिगताः शुभाश्वेत्  
केन्द्रद्वितीयसहजालयगाश्चसम्यक् ।  

चन्द्रोऽथवासलिलराशिविलग्नगरचेत्  
वृष्टिं वदेन्नियतमेव तदा धरित्र्याम् ॥२ ॥

During the bright fortnight (शुक्लपक्ष) of the month, if benefic planets occupy watery signs and be placed in an angular house, the second house or in the third house or if the Moon is placed in the ascendant identical with a watery sign it should be predicted that rainfall is sure to occur.

*NOTES:* According to the classification of rasis into fiery, earthy, airy and watery only Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are the three watery signs. In the context of rainy season Taurus, Libra, second half of Capricorn and Aquarius are also included in the list of watery signs. This is according to sage Badarayana. According to the Jataka Parijata Cancer, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces are watery signs. Taurus Gemini, Virgo and Aquarius are the signs depending upon water and hence they are also included in the list of watery signs.

Prasna Marga also agrees with the above classification. Reference may be made to sloka 90 of chapter 25 for the rasis that are watery. The Prasna Marga says that the quantity of water in them goes on decreasing with every quarter. This is to say that in the first part that is upto 7.30 the rasi contains maximum water. This may also be interpreted in another way. If the bhava (cusp) falls at 7.30 of a watery sign maximum rain can be predicted.

कर्कटमृगमीनानामुदये चन्द्रः सितोऽपि वृष्टिकरः ।  
तद्वत्केन्द्रोपगतौ सितचन्द्रौ वा शुभैर्दृष्टी ॥ ३ ॥

If the Moon or Venus is placed in the ascendant identical with Cancer, Capricorn, and Pisces rainfall occurs. Similarly, Venus and the Moon placed in an angular house aspected by benefics, produce rains.

शीतद्युतिः सलिलराशि विलग्नगामी  

वीर्यान्वितेन भृगुजेन निरीक्ष्यमाणः ।  
दृष्टि करोति महतीं भृगुजोऽपित--  
च्छीतांशुना बलयुतेन विलाकितश्येत् ॥४ ॥

If the ascendant falls in a watery sign and if the Moon is placed there, aspected by Venus, heavy rains occur. Venus also similarly placed and aspected by the Moon produces heavy rains.

॥इति श्री देवज्ञवल्लभायाध्यायः एकादशः ॥

Thus ends the chapter XI of Dalvajnavallabha entitled "Queries  
Regarding Rains"



TWELFTH

**Query relating to Marriage  
विवाहलाभः**

लग्नाच्छशी त्रिमदनायसुतारिसंस्थः  

सूर्यामरेज्यशशिजैरवलोक्यमानः ।  

प्रष्टुर्भवेन्नियतमेव विवाहदाता  
केन्द्रत्रिकोण भवनेष्वथवा शुभाश्च ॥१॥

If the Moon is placed in the houses 3, 5, 6, 7 or 11 from the ascendant aspected by the Sun, Jupiter and Mercury the querist is to be told that marriage is sure to take place. Similarly benefics placed in quadrants and trines cause marriage to occur.

*NOTES:* The Prasna Marga in reply to the question "Will there be the marriage" says that if at the time of query it is the dark fortnight and Moon occupies an even sign from ascendant, marraige cannot take place. The point for consideration is that mere presence of a planet at a particular place is not a sufficient condition to arrive any firm conclusion. This is more so about Moon and Mercury. The former is both a malefic as well as a benefic planet according to its waning and waxing position. There are various other factors that go to confirm the conclusion.

अत्रैव यदि योगे स्याच्छुभः सप्तमवेश्मनि ।  
तदा समेत सज्जायां पापश्चेद्रूपवर्जिताम् ॥२ ॥

Under these combinations, if a benefic is posited in the 7th house, he will get a good (beautiful) wife. If a malefic is in the 7th house, he will get a woman devoid of any beauty.

समस्थिते सूर्यसुते वरस्य लभ्या भवेन्निश्चितमेव कन्या ।  
अतोऽन्यथात्वं विषमस्थितेस्मिन्निःसंशयं प्रष्टुरुदाहरन्ति ॥३ ॥

If Saturn is placed in the 7th house identical with an even sign, the querist is sure to get a damsel for marriage. If it be in an odd sign he will not get any girl. So say the masters on this subject.

सप्तमवित्तोपचयस्थानस्योगुरुनिरीक्षितश्चंद्रः ।  

विदधाति युवतिलाभं तन्नाशं पापयुतदृष्टः ॥ ४ ॥

If the Moon is placed in the 2nd, 7th or the Upachaya houses aspected by Jupiter, he gets a young woman. If the same Moon is associated with a malefic planet or is aspected by malefic planets, he will not get any woman.

In our opinion the second house is quite relevant to the problem of marriage, because the second house standing as it does for "family" is instrumental in creating a family (marriage). In this connection attention is invited to "Brihat Parashara Horasastra."

*NOTES:* In slokas 2, 3 and 4 the sage has given the description of the counter-part. Seventh house stands for the partner. The plancts occupying the house will therefore influence the physcial appearance etc. of the partner. Another point that is worth consideration in this respect is the question of aspects and conjunctions etc. with the 7th lord and the 7th house.

यस्य प्रश्नविलग्नात् षष्ठाष्टमराशिगो भवेच्चंद्रः ।  
व्यूढस्य तस्य नूनं मृत्युः स्यादष्टमे वर्षे ॥ ५ ॥

If at a query (relating to marriage), the Moon is placed in the 6th or 8th house, the person dies in the eighth year after marriage.

*NOTES:* The death of the native is divined here merely on the basis of Moon occupying houses 6 or 8. In Sanketa Nidhi, Sanket 8 sloka 27 adds something, more for the same effect. One thing is that Moon's occupation of the ascendant will also bring about the same results as his occupation of houses 6 or 8 does. There is, however, a condition for widowhood. The condition is that malefics should be posited in the 7th house from Moon of from the ascendant.

Moon in the 8th house gives early death is a fact recognised by all standard works through their chapters on "Arishta". Moon reduces the longevity considerably when located in the 6th house

from the Ascendant. This is a fact perfectly in consonance with the authoritative texts but less known and practised.

यदि लग्नगतः क्रूरः पापस्तस्माच्च सप्तमे भवति ।  
सप्तभिरेव तदयैः पुंसो निधनं विनिर्देश्यम् ॥६॥

If a malefic is placed in the ascendant, and another malefic is placed in the 7th house therefrom, the person dies within seven years after marriage.

एवं लग्नोपगते चन्द्रे तस्माच्च सप्तमे भीमे ।  
परतो विवाहकालाज्जीवेन्मासाष्टकं स पुमान् ॥७॥

If the Moon is placed in the ascendant and Mars is placed in the 7th house, the person lives just for eight months after marriage.

उदयाष्टमराशिसंस्थिते भृगुपुप्यथवेन्दुनंदने ।  
विधवाक्षितिजे तु सप्तमे प्रियते निश्चितमेव कन्यका॥८॥

If Venus or Mercury is placed in the ascendant or the 8th house, in a query relating to marriage, the girl will surely become a widow. If Mars is placed in the 7th house the girl dies before marriage.

The location of a strong Mars in the 7th house of a female nativity where it is not exalted or in his own sign is dangerous for the longevity of the husband..This is quite understandable as Mars in the 7th house harms the house of the husband (7th) as well as the house of his longevity (8th from 7th) i.e. the second. We should therefore, examine both the 2nd and the 7th houses for this purpose.

दिवामणिः सप्तमगो लग्नात्कन्यां नृतप्रजां कुरुते ।  
कुलटामुदयोपगतः कुरुते नैवात्र संदेहः ॥६॥

If the Sun is placed in the 7th house, the children born to this girl will die. If the Sun is placed in the ascendant, he will make her immoral and unchaste. There is no doubt regarding this.

One of the contributory causes for the birth of dead issues can be the location of Sun in the 3rd the house from that of the progeny (5th). The 3rd from 5th is as much the house of longevity of progeny as the 8th, from 5th on the principle of "Bhavat Bhavam". Hence Sun in 7th is capable of producing abortion.

सक्रूरौ कुरुतोऽमृतांशशशिजौ षष्ठे स्त्रियं दुर्भगां  
कुर्वात शशिभार्गवौ च कुलटामाये च जायास्थितौ  
अत्रैवेन्दुजभार्गवी जनयतो वैधव्यमावश्यकं  
प्रत्येकं च सपापकैर्यदि ततोऽवश्यं तु वेश्या भवेत् ॥ १०॥

If Moon and Mercury placed in the 6th house are associated with malefics will make the girl ill-tempered and unlucky. If the Moon and Venus are placed in the eleventh or 7th house, the girl will become unchaste. If in these places, Mercury and Venus are associated with malefics the girl surely becomes a widow. In all the houses mentioned in the shloka if there exists association with malefics the girl becomes a prostitute.

लग्नात्स्मरेशत्रिसुतारिगश्चेद्गुर्वकंसौम्यैः शशभृन्न चान्यैः ।  
दृष्टो दिशेदाशु तदा विवाह चिरात्स विघ्नं त्वशुभेक्षितश्चेत् ॥११॥

If the Moon occupies any one of the house 3, 5, 6, 7 or 11 counted from the ascendant aspected by Jupiter, Sun and Mercury and not by other, it indicates that marriage is to take place immediately. If it is aspected by malefics, it will cause obstacles in the arrangement of the marriage.

लग्नगं शशिसुतं शशिनं वा वीक्षते बलयुतो यदि शुक्रः ।  
योषिदाप्तिरचिरेण तदा स्यात्पापदृष्टिसहितं तु न हीति ॥१२॥

If strong Venus aspects Mercury or the Moon placed in the ascendant, he will get a girl without any delay. If it is aspected by malefics, he will not.

चरालयस्थौ यदि लग्नचन्द्रौ विलोक्यमानौ भृगुनन्दनेन ।  
पापग्रहाः कण्टकसंगताश्चेत्प्रभूतकान्तां लभते तदानीम् ॥१३॥

If the ascendant and the Moon fall in movable sings and if both are aspected by Venus with a malefic placed in an angular house, he will get a good girl as bride.

॥ इति श्री दैवज्ञवल्लभायाध्यायः द्वादशः॥

Here ends chapter XII of Daivajnavallabha entitled "Acquisition of marriage"



THIRTEENTH

**Birth of Male or Female children  
स्त्रीपुंजन्माध्यायः**

स्थिरे विलग्ने स्थिरलग्नगामिभिग्रहैः शुभैश्चापि विलोकिते च ।  
नृतं युवत्या ध्रुवमेव गर्भ ब्रूयादिति श्रीयवनाधिनाथः॥१॥

In a query relating to pregnancy, if the ascendant falls in a fixed sign and is aspected by benefics it should be told that the woman is surely pregnant-This is the opinion of Yavanacharya.

NOTES:

Neelakantha has given certain planetary combinations in the horary chart indicating whether the lady is pregnant or not. The lady is pregnant if Moon and lagna lord are posited in the quadrants or they are posited in the 5th house.

The lady is not pregnant if Moon and the lagnesha are posited in houses 3, 6 or 9 and the 5th lord does neither aspect the lagna nor the 5th house.

लग्नतौ विषमराशिगः शनिः पुत्रजन्मनि भवेत्स कारणम् ।  
स्त्रीजनिश्च समगे शनैश्चरे प्राह दिव्यगणको बृहस्पतिः ॥ २ ॥

If Saturn occupies an odd sign, he causes the birth of a son. If he occupies an even sign, he causes the birth of a girl-Thus it has been told by Brihaspati, the great celestial astrologer.

*NOTES:* However, Saturn is not to occupy the Ist house. So says Varahamihira, "विहायलग्नं विषमर्क्षसंस्थः सौरोऽपि पुंजन्मकरो विलग्नात् in his Brihat Jataka, that ascendant is to be exempted in applying this rule.

पुरुषवर्गगते च यथोदये नरनभोगतिनाऽभिनिरीक्षिते ।  
बलिनि निश्चितमेव सुतोद्भवो वरमपीह शुभं लभतेऽगना ॥ ३ ॥



If the ascendant falls in a number of male vargas (rasi, drekkana, navamsa, dwadasamsa etc., are owned by a male planet) and be strongly aspected by male planets, surely a son will be born. If the query concerns marriage the girl will surely get a good bridegroom.

*NOTES:* The last condition pertains to the query regarding marriage of a girl.

उदयगतौ स्त्रीराशौ स्त्रीनवभागेपि पुंग्रहाऽदृष्टे ।  
स्त्रीजन्म भवति तद्वत्स्त्रीनेष्काणोदये यवनः ॥ ४ ॥

Yavanacharya has declared that if the ascendant falls on a female sign, or female Navamsa or female Drekkana and and is not aspected by any male planet a girl child will be born.

ओज पुरुषांशकेषु बलिभिर्लग्नार्कगुर्विन्दुभिः  
पुंजन्म प्रवदेत्समांशकगतैर्युग्मेषु तैर्योषितः ।  
गुर्वर्को विषमे नरं शशिसितौ वक्रत्व युग्मे स्त्रियं  
धीलाभोपगतैः शुभैरुदयतः स्त्री गर्भयुक्ता ध्रुवम् ॥५ ॥

If the ascendant, Jupiter and the Moon be placed in odd signs and in the signs and Navamsas owned by male planets and be endowed with strength, a son will be born. If these are placed in an even sign and the Navamsas owned by female planets, a girl will be", born. If Jupiter and the Sun be in an odd sign, birth of a son is to predicted.

If the Moon, Venus and Rahu are placed in

n even sign and an even Navamsa birth of a girl is to be predicted.

If there are benefics in the 5th and 11th houses, then the woman is pregnant.Varaha Mihira

andothers have discussed the role

of signs in this context. This is

being discussed below:

*NOTE:* Varaha

Mihira has included Sun also and done away wih the condition

at the navamsa rasi lord should be male or female says that a male child shall be born if the lagna, Sun,

supier and Moon are in odd signs or in the navamsas of odd signs or

if a strong Sun and Jupiter occupy odd signs. If the Lagna, Sun, Moon and Jupiter happen to be in even signs or in the navamsas of even signs the birth would be of a female child.

चन्द्रलग्नान्तरगतैर्ग्रहैःस्वरुपसूतिकाः ।  
बहिरन्तश्च चक्रार्थे दृश्याऽदृश्याऽन्यथा परे ॥६ ॥

The number of nurses attending the lady during delivery will be equal to the number of planets placed between the ascendant and Moon. So many nurses will be outside the delivery room as there are planets in the visible half of the zodiac and so many will be inside as there are planets in the invisible half.

*NOTES:-* According to Brihat Jataka the number of nurses attending the lady is the same as there are planets between the lagna and Moon. Saravali gives more details in this respect. The number of nurses inside and outside the delivery room depends upon the number of planets in the visible and invisible half of the zodiac, There are some acharyas who say that the number of nurses depends upon the lagna of the native birth chart. Following are the details:

|                       |               |
|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
|         Lagna         | No. of nurses |
|    Pisces or Aries    |      one      |
|  Taurus or Aquarius   |     four      |
| Sagittarius or Cancer |     Five      |
|      Other signs      |     five      |

The visible half extends (roughly) from the Navamsa of the 7th house to the Navamsa in which the ascendant falls. The invisible half extends from the Navamsa containing the ascendant to the Navamsa containing the 7th house.

बलयुक्तौ स्वगृहांशे

ष्यर्कसितावुपचयर्क्षगौ पुंसाम् ।  

स्त्रीणां वा कुजचन्द्रौ यदा तदा सम्भवति गर्भः ॥७ ॥

**Time of conception :-** If in a male nativity Sun and Venus are placed in Upachayasthanas identical with signs of their Navamsas and be endowed with strength conception will take place. (i. e., their

wives will conceive and child will be born). Similarly, if in the case of females Mars and the Moon are similarly situated conception will take place.

*NOTES:* If the query is put by a male person, the first condition should be applied. If by a female the second one is to be applied.

According to Brihat Jataka the conception is there leading to safe delivery:-

If the benefics are posited in lagna or Moon sign or in both the

houses.

or

If the benefics occupy the second, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th. houses from Chandra lagna or the lagna.

The essential condition to the above yogas is that the malefics are posited in the 3rd, or 11th house from Moon or the lagna and the Moon or the lagna at the same time is aspected by Sun. Here Mercury, Venus and Jupiter may be treated as the benefics.

According to Sh. K. S. Krishnamurti it is easier to find out whether the lady is pregnant. The 5th house stands for conception and children. It is the sub lord of the 5th cusp who has to be examined. The sub lord of the 5th cusp should be deposited in a fruitful sign and also should be in the constellation of planet who is the significator of the 2nd or 5th or 11th house. If the above two conditions are fulfilled the lady is pregnant and shall give birth to a child.

सौरांशेऽब्जांशे वा चन्द्रः सौरान्वितोऽथवा हिबुके ।  
शान्तो दीपो जन्मन्याधाने प्रश्नकाले वा ॥ ८ ॥

If Moon is placed in the Navamsa of Saturn or in its own Navamsa or be conjoined with Saturn in the 4th house, the lamp has been already extinguished. This condition can be applied to Natal and Prenatal (आघान कुण्डली) charts also.

*NOTES:* Brihat Jataka lays down some more Conditions which indicate that there was complete darkness at the time of the birth of the native. Sloka 17 of chapter 5 refers. The additional conditions are (a) Saturn aspects Moon or (b) Saturn and Moon are conjoined or (c) Moon is posited in the navamsa of a watery sign. If Moon is aspected by Sun the indications are that there was light and no darkness.

पापद्वयमध्यसंस्थितौ लग्नेन्दू न च सौम्यपीक्षितौ ।  
युगपत्पृथगेव वा वदेन्नारी गर्भयुक्ता विपद्यते ॥ ९॥

If the ascendant and the Moon are placed between two malefics without being aspected by benefics, the woman in pregnancy dies.

*NOTES:* The ascendant and the Moon may be together or may be situated in different signs. Vide Brihat Jataka Chapter 4 Sloka 7.

भृगुसुतो वसुधातनयो गुरुर्दिनपतिः शशभृद्रविनन्दनः ।  
शशिसुतोऽपि च लग्नपतीरविः शशधरोऽपि च मासपतिः क्रमात् ॥१० ॥

The planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, Mercury, the lord of the ascendant, the Sun, and the Moon are the lords of the Months of pregnancy starting from the time of conception.

NOTES : Vide Brihat Jataka Chapter 4 Sloka 16 for furtherdetails.

ऐते यदा शत्रुगृहे वसन्ति युद्धे जिताः शत्रुभिरस्तगा वा ।  
अन्यत्र वा पीडितदेहभाजो गर्भस्य पातं जनयन्ति खेटाः ॥११ ॥

These planets cause abortion in the months pertaining to them, when they are in enemy's camp, defeated in planetary war conjoined with enemies, placed in heliacal setting or are afflicted otherwise.

रक्तस्तीक्ष्णतनुर्दिनेश उदितः सौन्दर्यवान शीतगुः क्रूराक्षो  
धरणीसुतोऽतिविनयी सोमात्मजोऽपि स्मृतः ।  

जीव पंडितमण्डलीषु सहितः शुक्रश्च काणः शनिः  
खंजो लग्नसमन्वितो निजफलं दत्ते बलं चिन्त्यताम् ॥१२ ॥

**Colour and Shapes of Planets:** The Sun is red and cruel. The Moon is beautiful. Mars has fierce eyes. Mercury is extremely modest. Jupiter is ever in the company of learned men. Venus is one-eyed. Saturn is lame. (Saturn if afflicted gives trouble in legs. Hence called lame). These planets when placed in the ascendant produce similar results to the native. Due consideration must be given to their strengths, however.

*NOTES:* Physical features etc. are judged by the ascendant and the planets occupying and aspecting it. As one sign of the zodiac forming the ascendant remains in the horizon for about two hours. Many children are born during that period at any particular place. Experience does not show that all the children born on a particular date, time and place have the same physical features. In some cases the twins born with difference of 4 or 5 minutes are very different from each other. In the Krishnamurti Padhdhati they work out the cusps of the asscendant. As the cusp takes about 4 minutes to pass away we come very near to minute difference. The cusp will give us the constellation lord as well as the sub-lord of the constellation. Finer differences can be worked out on the basis of sub-lords. This detailed judgement explains the difference between the twins born with a difference of few minutes. To explain the point we may take an example. Twins were born with a difference of 6 minutes. While the ascendant remained Scorpio the cusps fell in the sign at 1.19 and 2.36. In both the cases the constellation remained the same Visakha. The sub-lord of the cusp changed. The earlier one was born in the sub of Mars and the later one is the sub of Rahu. These planets give the difference.

"Birth of Male or Female children'.



FOURTEEN

**Miscellaneous Matters  
प्रकीर्णाध्यायः**

च्युतिर्लग्नाज्ज्ञेया हिबुकगृहतो वृद्धिरुदिता  
प्रवासः स्यान्मध्याद्भवति विनिवृत्तिः स्मरगृहात् ।  
गृहैरेतत्प्रश्नोदयसमयगैर्वाच्यमखिलं  
प्रविष्टः स्वं गेहं हिबुकगृहगे प्रोषितपुमान् ॥१॥

Fall is to be divined from the ascendant, prosperity from the 4th, exile from the 10th and return from 7th house. All these matters are to be judged from the position of plancts at time the of query in these houses. If a strong benefic planet is placed in the 4th house, say that the person who had gone out has entered his house.

*NOTES:*च्युतिः= fall signifies matters such as resignation of a post, demotion, loss of status, transfer, dwnfall, release of a person under arrest. If the query-ascendant falls in a movable sign, and it is combined with or aspected by benefics, these results take place, otherwise they do not.

Promotions, increase of power, prestige and money and other matters of this nature are signified byवृद्धिः=prosperity. They are to

be read from the 4th house.

Travel, going to foreign places, happiness or troubles during travel are to be studie from 10th house.

Return from travel, freedom from discases and troubles, recovery of lost atrieles are signified byनिवृत्ति= fight return and they are to be studied from the 7th house.

लग्नादद्वितीयनिधनास्तमयेषु सौम्यैः  
पापैस्त्रिषष्ठभगतैश्च शुभ फलं स्यात् ।  
व्यत्यासतः सपदि सेवकसेव्ययोश्च  
नित्यं प्रवासकलही प्रतिपादनीयौ ॥ २ ॥

**Query Relating to Servant and Master:** There will be good results to both servant and the master if benefics are placed in houses 2, 8 and 7 and malefics in the 3rd and 6th house. But if the situation be reverse i. e., if houses 2, 7 and 8 are occupied by malefics and houses 3 and 6 are occupied by benefics there will be discord and strife between the master and the servant and there will be staying away from the home.

सौम्यैरष्टमसंस्थैर्द्वितीयसंस्थैस्तथैव दीर्घायुः ।  
भवति प्रष्टुर्नित्यं तदन्यथात्न्यथात्वं स्यात् ॥ ३॥

If benefics occupy the 8th and 2nd house, long-life is to be predicated for the querist. But if malefics occupy these houses, his life will be short.

*NOTES:* The 8th house indicates longevity of the native as per the well-known dictum of Parashara "अष्टमं ह्यायुषः स्थानमष्टमादष्टमं तथा ।" Conjunction and aspect of benefic planets to the 8th house produce long life to the querist.

दशम चतुर्थैरेभिः सुखसंपत् क्षतिस्तु विपरीते ।  
वित्तैकादशसंस्थैर्विताप्तिःप्रष्टुरादेश्या ॥४॥

If benefics occupy 10th and 4th houses there will be happiness and prosperity. If these houses are occupied by malefics, happiness and prosperity of the native will suffer. If benefics are placed in the 2nd an 11th houses, acquisition of wealth is to be predicted.

पापैर्विलग्ने परिपृच्छतस्तु शरीरपीठा कलहत्य वाच्यः ।  
सुखक्षतिः स्यात्सुखगैगृहस्य भेदस्तथा बांधवविग्रहश्च ॥ ५ ॥

If malefics occupy the ascendant of query, there will be bodily ailments and strifes to the querist. If malefics occupy the 4th house, he will not be happy. There will arise quarrels in the house and enmity with relatives.

अस्तस्थितैः स्याद्गमनस्य बाधः कर्मस्थितैः कर्मविनाशमाहुः ।  
सर्वत्र चामुत्र शुभैर्नदृष्टे कृच्छ्रेण संसिद्धिमुदाहरन्ति ॥ ६ ॥

Planets placed in the 7th house produce obstacles during travel. The wise declare evil results for Karma if malefics are posited in the tenth house. The desired object (d) will be accomplished with great difficulty if the concerned houses are not aspected by benefics.

शीतद्युतौ पापयुतेक्षिते वा नारीजनैः स्यात्सह विप्रहस्तु ।  
सुखस्थितैर्द्यूनगतैश्च यद्वा तथैव पापैरवधारणीयः ॥७॥

If the Moon is conjoined with or aspected by malefic plancts, there will be quarrels with womenfolk. Or if there be malefic planets placed in the 4th and 7th houses the same result is to be understood.

*NOTES:* The Moon always represents women. Malefic influence on the Moon therefore indicates quarrels with some woman. Similarly 4th house signifies mother. The 7th house indicates one's wife. Both are female houses.

लग्नादष्टमगेऽर्के शुभयुक्ते या शुभेन संदृष्टे ।  
तस्माद्देशादन्यं देशं गत इति पिता तस्य ॥८॥

In a query regarding the whereabouts of one's father if the Sun is placed in the eighth house from the ascendant, combined with or aspected by a benefic his father has already gone away from the place where he was residing previously to some other place.

*NOTES:* पृथुयशस् has also mentioned this combination in षट्पंचाशिका sloka No. 12, Chapter VII.

सूर्यः कटुः शशधरो लवणो महीज-  
स्तिक्तो विमिश्रितरसश्च शशांकसूनुः ।  
जीवो भवेच्च मधुरोऽम्लकषायकौ च  
शुक्रार्कजौ च बलवानिह केन्द्रगामी ॥९॥

(Now the tastes pertaining to the planets are told : This is useful in a query regarding diet. i. e. भोजनप्रश्न).

The Sun indicates pungent taste, the Moon saltish, Mars bitter, Mercury mixture of various tastes, Jupiter sweet, Venus sour, and

Saturn astringent. The planet placed in an angular house, is to be taken as strong and the taste indicated by the same is to be told as being predominant in the food taken by the querist.

*NOTES:* It is said that in the past kings used to test the ability of astrologers by putting queries regarding the food taken by them during the day. Such questions are treated under the head. "**भोजनप्रश्न"** in ancient treatises. One can be easily convinced about the truth of this science by putting these principles to test.

यस्तत्र काले किल लग्नदृग् वा ग्रहो रसस्तस्य तु यः प्रदिष्टः ।  
स एव तावत्प्रतिपादनीयो बलक्रमेण द्वितये रसात्च ॥१० ॥

The taste ascribed to the planet that aspects the ascendant or failing it the one placed in a quadrant is to be proclaimed.

Other tastes are to be told in the order of the powerful planets according to their strength.

*NOTES:* Vide Prasna Jnana Sloka 37.

सौम्यर्कसंस्थस्य स शोभनः स्यात्पापर्शसंस्थस्य तु नीरसः स्यात् ।  
ग्रहस्य वक्रस्य रस न भोक्ता भुक्तं च पात्रे च पुनः प्रदत्तम् ॥११॥

The taste will be good if the planet is placed in a sign belonging to a benefic planet. It will be without any taste if the sign belongs to a malefic, If the planet is retrograde, the person who is dining will not eat things of that taste already placed in the plate. But will taste it when given afterwards.

*NOTES:* The Prasna Marga says that the things eaten should be judged from 3rd house and drinks taken from the 4th house. In other words the qualities of planets may have to be taken into consideration if they influence the 3rd and 4th houses for the purposes of food and drinks respectively.

According to some other acharyas the caste of the querent is to be judged from the sign in the 4th house and the planets influencing it and qualities of person taking meals from the 5th house. The dishes like chatni (sauce) and achaar (pickles) etc. should be determined by 6th house. The 7th house in the context, according to these acharyas, stands for drinks of various types. Eighth house shows the quality of food. The 9th house will give the number of persons taking meals, the

result of food, that is, satisfaction or non satisfaction can be judged form 10th house and subject discussed from the 11th and rest from the 12th house. Briefly speaking we can say that lagna indicates the eater, the second shows the utensils in which food was served, the 3rd house eatables, 4th drinks, 5th house the mood of the eater, 6th the dishes served, 7th house the drinks etc., 8th the condition of meals, 9th the parsons who dined, 10th the satisfaction or non satisfaction, 11th the talks at the table, and 12th house the rest or sleep after food.

स्थिरे विलग्ने न गमागमौ स्तो न रोगशान्तिनं च वित्तनाशः ।  
मृतो न नष्टो न पराभवोऽपि चरे विलग्ने विपरीतमेतत् ॥१२ ॥

When the ascendant falls in a fixed sign and the query relates to travel or return of a person gone abroad, there will be neither travel nor any return. The disease will not subside in a query relating to disease. There will be no loss of wealth in a query relating to money matters. The patient will not die, in a query concerning disease. If it concerns a person gone abroad, he will not be lost (i. e., he will come back safe.)

If the query is regarding victory or defeat, there will be no defeat. But if the ascendant falls in a movable sign, all these results will be reverse.

*NOTES:* Videषट् पांशिका 1 and 2 chapter II.

विमिश्रितं स्याद् द्वितनौ तदंशद्वये चरस्थावरवदन्ति ।  
शुभेक्षणाल्लग्नशशांकयोर्वा भवेच्छुभं चाशुभमन्यथा तु ॥ १३ ॥

If a dual sign rises, mixed results will happen. Similar results are to be told when movable and fixed navamsas rise.

If there is benefic aspect over the ascendant and the Moon, all types of good results will happen. If both are aspected by malcfic planets, bad results will occur.

कंदृक्श्रोत्रनसाकपोलहनवो वक्रं च होरादयस्ते  
कण्ठांसकबाहुपार्श्वहृदयक्रोठानिनाभिस्ततः ।  
वस्तिः शिश्नगुदे ततश्च वृषणा

वूरु ततो जानुनी  
जंघांघीत्युभयत्र वा समुदितैद्रेष्काणभागस्त्रिधा ॥ १४॥

The houses, ascendant onwards, represent head, eyes, ears, nose, cheek, chin and the face respectively. The same houses are representatives of the limbs neck, shoulders, hands, sides (flanks), heart, bosom and navel. They also signify the houses bladder, genitals, anus, thighs, knees, and the feet. In this way, the representation of the limbs of the human body by the various bhavas according to the rising of the 1st, 2nd and the 3rd drekkanas of the risig sign respectively is to be underestood.

*NOTES:* If the 1st decanate rises, the ascendant signifies the head. The 2nd and 12th houses represent the two eyes and so on. If the 2nd decanate rises, the ascendant represents neck. The 2r. house denotes shoulders and so on. If the 3rd decanate rises, the ascendant signifies the urinary bladder. For details see Brihat Jataka Chapter V Sloka 24.

तस्मिन्पापयुते व्रणः शुभयुते दृष्टे च लक्ष्मादिशे-  
त्स्वर्क्षशस्थिरसंयुते च सहजः स्यादन्यथाऽगंतुकः ।  
मन्देऽश्मानिलजोऽग्निशस्त्रविषजो भौमे बुधे भूभवः  
सूर्ये काष्ठचतुष्पदेन हिमगी रंगाब्जजोऽन्यैः शुभः ॥ १५ ॥

There will be a wound or sore on that part of the body signified by the house which is conjoined with or aspected by a malefic. There will be a mole etc., on the house combined with or aspected by a benefic planet. If that planet happens to be placed in its own sign or navamsa or a fixed sign, the wound or mole will be from the time of birth. Otherwise, it will be one caused at a later stage. The cause of the scar would be as follows: Saturn-through stone, or wind-trouble; Mars-fire, weapons or poison; Mercury-through wood or some animal: Moon-through being pierced by horns of an animal or by water. Other benefic planets produce the scar through some good

cause.

समनुपतिता यस्मिन्भागे त्रयः सबुधा ग्रहा  
भवति नियमात्तस्यावाप्तिः शुभेष्वशुभेषु वा ।  
व्रणकृदशुभः षष्ठो लग्नात्तनौ भसमाश्रिते  
तिलकमसकृदृष्टः सौम्यैर्भवेत्स च लक्ष्मवान् ॥१६॥



The house wherein three planets along with Mercury are situated, produces invariably a wound or a mole in the part of the body signified by that house. If a malefic is situated in the 6th house, in the part of the body signified by sign in which the sixth house falls, wounds are caused. If that planet is aspected by benefic planets, there will be a mole or mark on that part. If it be only conjoined with benefic planets there will be just a mark.

NOTES : Vide Brihat Jataka Chapter V Sloka 26 for details.

क्रियः शिरोवक्रगमी वृषोऽन्यः पादांसकौ पृष्ठमुरोऽथपार्श्वे ।  
कुक्षिस्त्वपानोऽधयथ मेद्रमुष्कौ स्फिकपुच्छमित्याह चतुष्पदांगे ॥१७॥

In the body of beasts, the signs Aries onwards represent the head, face, legs, shoulders, back, breast, sides, belly, rectum, feet, genitals, buttocks and the tail.

As shown in the table below:

|           |     |      |      |         |         |       |        |

| Remainder |  1  |  2   |  3   |    4    |    5    |   6   |   7    |
|  Planet   | Sun | Moon | Mars | Mercury | Jupiter | Venus | Saturn |
| Gunakara  |  5  |  21  |  14  |    9    |    8    |   3   |   11   |

Ascertain the measure in Anguls of the shadow of the shanku at the time of the query. With the help of this shadow find out the longitude of the Ascendant at the time according to the rules given in "GRAH LAGHAV" (We can find out straight away also the Ascendant)-Leave the signs and degrees of the Ascendant and taking only the minutes multiply the minutes by the lenght of the shadow. Divide the product by 7 and find out the remainder. In the Table given above multiply the figure of the remainder with its corresponding figure shown under it (under 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.). Divide the product by 71. Take the remainder. Deduct from this remainder the figure 5, 21, 14 etc., shown under Sun, Moon, Mars etc. Go on deducting these figures until further deduction is not possible. The number that cannot be deducted will show the number of days etc. in which work will be accomplished. The Number will be days if the non-diminishable number falls under Sun or Mars.

It will be so many fortnights if the undiminishable number falls under Venus or Moon. It will be so many months if the undiminishable number falls under Jupiter. It will be so many years if it falls under Saturn.

*Example:* Suppose with the head of Shanku or the Ephemeris we find that the Ascendant at the time of the query is 5-6-15 and the shadow of the shanku is 6.5 Anguls. Multiplying 15 minutes by 6.5 we get 97.5 dividing it by 7 we get 6.5 as the remainder. This is more than 6, hence we will take it as 7. (For Saturn) multiplying 7 by 11 (shown under 7) we get 77. Dividing it by 71 we get 6 as the remainder. Deducting 5 from 6 we get 1 as undiminishable figure. This falls under Moon. Hence we would say (if Moon is away from Sun by more than 72 degrees and is well aspected) that the work would be accomplished in a fortnight's time.

Divide the product of the length of the shadow of the shanku and the number of minutes in the longitude of the ascendant by 71 (i.e., the sum of the multipliers). Find the remainder. From this

remainder go on reducing the progressive totals of Sun onwards. The remainder finally obtained indicates the planet. (The planet whose number cannot be reduced from the remainder is thus be taken).

If the remainder indicates Mars or the Sun, the object will be accomplished in so many days. If it indicates Venus or the Moon, the matter will be completed in a period of fortnights. If it be jupiter, it will be achieved in a period of months. Mercury denotes Ritus (Ritu= a period of two months) Saturn denotes years.

*NOTES.*Suppose the remainder is 44 on dividing the product referred to in sloka 21 by 71.

44–5=39, 39-21 (Moon) = 18.

18–14 (Mars)=4. Next we have to subtract 9th figure of Mercury but we cannot. So Mercury determines the time period. Mercury is a benefic planet. So, we have to declare that the undertaking will be accomplished in so many seasons.

आधाने तदनु जये पराजये वा शत्रूणां  
निधन विधौ समागमे वा ।  
अर्थाप्तौ शुभमशुभं च सर्व कालं पृच्छायां  
समयमिमं विचिन्त्य वाच्यम् ॥२३ ॥

At a query regarding conception, victory, defeat, destruction of enemies, meeting with new persons, and acquisition of wealth, the time of fruition of good and bad results is to be declared in this way after careful thought.

*NOTE:* The time when these matters will be accomplished is to be decided by the rule given in sloka 22 of this chapter.

रवी विलग्ने ज्वलनः प्रदीपो रक्तं च वस्त्रं नृप-दर्शनं च ।  
श्वेतं च वस्त्रं सितपुष्पगंधा नारी च पीयूषमयूखगर्भे ॥ २४ ॥

**Query relating to Dreams**. In a query relating to dreams, if the Sun is placed in the ascendant he has seen fire, a lamp, red cloth or a king in the dream.

If the Moon is placed in the ascendant, he has seen white cloth, white flower, scent or a woman in the dream.

महीसुते विद्रुमहेमरक्त स्नावस्तथैवार्द्र मृगादिमांसम् ।  
शशांकपुत्रे नमसि प्रयाणं जीये सुरैर्बन्धुजनेन योगः ॥२५ ॥

Mars placed in the ascendant indicates that he would have seen coral, gold, blood, or fresh meat of an animal, Mercury in the ascendant denotes dreams about travel by air. Jupiter there, would point to dreams of meeting gods and relatives.

शुक्रे सलिलोत्तरणं तुंगाक्रमणं खरांशुपुत्रे च ।  
लग्नस्ये वक्तव्यं स्वप्नप्रश्ने विमिश्रितं मिश्रः ॥२६ ॥

Venus in the ascendant tells about dreams regarding swimming in water. Saturn therein indicates climbing mountains and lofty places. If many planets are placed in the ascendant mixed results are to be told.

*NOTE:* It was common for the kings to test the ability of an astrologer through queries relating to the dreams they had during the night. Many ancient works treat this topic in detail.

शत्रुग्रहनीचगृहर्दुःस्वप्नो निर्जितैग्रहैर्वाच्यः ।  
रविकिरणलुप्तकायैः स्वप्ने प्रष्टुर्भवेद्भंगः ॥२७॥

If there is a planet in the ascendant placed in ir mical sign or in debilitation or defeated in planetary war, the pers a has seen a bad dream. If there is a planet in setting (

अस्तंगता) piaced in the ascendant, the querist will meet with defeat.

लग्नचन्द्रान्तरालसंखया फल ककालो वाच्यः ।  
स्वस्वप्नांतरेरूप्यं पूर्वपूर्ववदित्येवं प्राह यवनेश्वरः ॥२५॥

The time of

fuctification of the results is to be told from the

numberof signs between the ascendant and the Moon. The results of

one's own dreams are to be guessed as told above. Thus Yavaneshwara has declared.

अकचटतपयशवर्गा रविकुज सितसौम्यजीवसौरीणाम् ।  
चन्द्रस्य च निर्दिष्टा प्रश्ने प्रथमोद्भवं वर्णम् ॥२६॥

The seven classes of letters beginning with (1) अ (2) क (3) च (4) ट (5) व (6) प and ( 7 ) य and श are allotted to the planets the Sun, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and the Moon respectively. From the first letter of the query, the ascendant should be determined.

ज्ञात्वा तस्माल्लग्नं संगृ

ह्यशुभाशुभं वदेत्प्रष्टुः ।  
वर्गादिमध्यचरमैर्वर्णैः प्रश्नोद्भवैर्विषमम् ॥ ३० ॥

The good and bad results are to be told to the querist. If the letter is the first, third or the fifth of the class (वर्ग), the odd sign belonging to the planet is to be fixed as the ascendant.

शशिं लग्नं प्रवदेच्छेषैर्युग्मं सितझजीवानाम् ।  
कुजरविजयोश्च नैव रविशशिनोरेकराशित्वात् ॥३१ ॥

By the rest i. e., the second and fourth letters, the even sign belonging to the planet is to be taken as the ascendant. This process is to be applied to find out the lagna belonging to Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn, but not for the Sun and the Moon for they own one sign each. Letters of Sun give Leo and those of Moon Cancer as the ascendant.

तस्मात्प्राग्वत्प्रवदेत्पृच्छासमये शुभाशुभं सर्वम् ।  
कालस्याविज्ञानादेतच्चिन्त्यं सदा प्रश्ने ॥३२॥

From that ascendant all the good and bad results are to be proclaimed as before. If the time of query cannot be determined exactly this method is to be adopted for fixing the ascendant in dealing with queries.

NOTES :

[TABLE]

*Example :* If the query is : मम कार्यं कदा सेत्स्यति ? When will my work be accomplished? The 1st letter uttered by the querist is म. It belongs to Saturn, Saturn owns 10th and 11th rasis. Becauseम is the 5th letter, we should take the odd sign. Thus Kumbha will be the sign to be taken as the ascendant.

**Judgement from Ascendant  
लग्नचिन्ताध्यायः**

देहः कोशो योधो बाह्यं मन्त्रः शत्रुर्मार्गीऽथायुः।  
चित्तं कर्म प्राप्तिर्मन्त्री प्राग्लग्नाद्या भावाश्चिन्त्याः ॥१ ॥

The twelve houses ascendant onwards represent body, treasure fighting, vehicles, counsel, enemies, path, longevity, mind, occupaton, gains and minister.

त्रिलाभवर्जं रविसौरिभौमा निघ्नन्ति नो कर्म च सूर्यभौमौ ।  
पुष्णन्ति सौम्या रिपु राशिव

ज्यं नास्तं भृगुर्मृत्युमिनमिन्दुः ॥२॥

The Sun, Saturn and Mars spoil occupied house excepting the 3rd and the eleventh houses. The Sun and Mars do not spoil the 10th house by their occupation. The benefics cause all the houses to flourish by their placement except the 6th house. But Venus is not good in the 7th house. The Moon is not auspicious in the 8th house. Nor is it good for the house falling in the sign of Leo.

लग्नोपगतैः सौम्यैरारोग्यं वित्तसौख्यं च ।  
अर्थस्थैरथचयो योधविवृद्धिस्तृतीयस्यैः ॥ ३ ॥

Benefics placed in the ascendant bestow good health, riches and comforts upon the native. While placed in the second house, they cause acquisition of wealth. In the third house, they cause increase in the strength of the army.

वाहनसुहृदां वृद्धिश्चतुर्थगैः पंचमैस्तु मंत्रबलम् ।  
रिपुनाशं षष्ठस्था भृगुवज्यं सप्तमेऽध्वहिताः॥४॥

If benefics are posited in the fourth house, there will be increase in the prospects of vehicles and friends. While situated in the fifth house, they cause the benefits of good counsel. In the sixth

house, benefics destroy the enemies. Excepting Venus all other planets are favourable for travel when placed in the 7th.

रक्षत्यायुर्निधने शशिवज्यं नवममे यशः संपत् ।  
कर्मणि सिद्धिर्लाभो बलसंघातश्च दशमाद्यैः ॥५ ॥

In the eighth house, benefics excepting the Moon protect the life of the person (i. e., they cause prolonged life for the person). In the ninth house they give fame and wealth. In the tenth house they produce victory in one's undertakings. In the eleventh, they cause much gains. In the twelfth, they cause increase in the strength of the army.

भौमार्कार्किशशांकैर्लग्ने वधबंधमरणसंत्रासाः ।  
अर्थक्षयो द्वितीयैस्तृतीयसंस्थैर्यशो द्युतिमत् ॥६ ॥

If Mars, the Sun, Saturn, and the Moon are placed in the ascendant, there will arise murder, confinement in jail, death and fear respectively. If they are in the second house, they cause decay of wealth. In the third house they produce fame.

वाहनमित्रवियोगो मंत्रस्नावो रिपुक्षयश्चेति ।  
हिबुकादिषु सप्तमगैः स्वविषयनाशो भृगुसुते च॥७ ॥

In the 4th house, there will be loss of vehicles and friends. In the 5th house, they will cause leakage of secret counsel. In the 6th house, they are good. They will cause the destruction of enemies. If they be in the 7th house, they do not give good results. Same (bad) is the result if Venus occupies the 7th house.

मृत्युर्निधनोपगतैः सेनाव्यसनं महन्नवमस्थैः ।  
दशमस्थौ कुजसूर्यौ जयदौ भंगप्रदः सौरिः ॥ ८ ॥

In the 8th house, the aforesaid malefics cause early death, When they are placed in the 9th house, they produce troubles to the army. In the tenth house Mars and the Sun produce victory. But Saturn therein will cause defeat.

जय एकादशसंस्थैः क्रूरैरन्त्योपगैः स्वबलभेदः ।  

उपचयवर्ज सौम्यैर्यत्तत्पापैर्विपर्यस्तम् ॥ ६ ॥

In the eleventh house all of them indicate victory. In the 12th house, they cause division and betrayal in the army. The results produced by the malefics in the house other than the Upachaya ones (ie, 3, 6, 10 and 11 ) are exactly opposite in nature to those produced by the benefics in these houses.

क्रूरेऽप्यनुकूलस्थः शस्तो लग्ने शुभोऽपि नानिष्टः ।  
वक्री न शुभः केन्द्रे तदहस्तद्वर्गलग्नं च ॥ १० ॥

Even if a malefic is happily posited in the ascendant it is praiseworthy. A benefic planet, if afflicted, is not good in the ascendant. A retrograded planct is not good if it is placed in an angular house. Its day, Vargas (Decanate, Navamsha etc.) and its stay in the ascendant also will not prove to be auspicious.

**Interpretation of Decanates.** The matters to be judged from the first decanate of the ascendant of query upto the last decanate of the 12th house are respectively : ( 1 ) The king, (2) his

commander-in-chief (3) royal astrologer, (4) priest and doctor, servants (5) status and prowess, (6) dealings and army (7) food (8) sleeping (9) sitting (10) vehicles (11) seat and couch (12) eating and drinking (13) prince (14) counsel and strength (15), (16), (17), and (18) enemy, (19) resting of the army (20) wealth (21) magistrate imposing punishments on the guilty (22) troubles to the army (23) mutiny in the army (24) commander-in-chief (25) health of the army (26) soldiers (27) four-fold strength (28) actions (29) treasury (30) fructification of results (31) meritorious deeds (32) actions (33) wealth (34) soldiers (35) worship (36) end of travel.

इत्युदयाद्या भावा द्रेष्काणैर्ये मयाऽऽदिष्टाः ।  
सदसत्फलमादेश्यं सदसद्युतवीक्षणात्तेषाम् ॥१८॥

These are the matters relating to the 36 decanates beginning from the ascendant of query. Good and bad results relating to the matters which I have declared is to be foretold according to conjunction and aspect on decanates of benefic and malefic planets.

नवमांशे तिग्मांशोर्वाहननाशो विलग्नसम्प्राप्ते ।  
कृच्छ्रात् स्वगृहगमनं प्रतापमृदुला च चन्द्रांश ॥१६॥  
कौजेऽग्निभयं बौधे मित्रप्राप्तिर्धनागमो जैवे ।  
भोगविवृद्धिः शौक्रे भृत्यविनाशो रविसुतांशे च ॥ २० ॥

**Results from Navamsas.** The results arising from the ascendant falling in the Navamsas of the seven planets beginning from the sun and ending with Saturn are: (1) loss of vehicles, (2) loss of prowess and return to home with difficulty, (3) fear from fire, (4) acquisition of friends, (5) gain of wealth, (6) various material pleasures and (7) death and destruction.

यदुदयति फलं प्रदिष्टं जनयति तस्य नवांशको विलग्ने ।  
शुभभवननवांशके सहायं रिपुबलभाग उपैति यातुरर्थात् ॥२१॥

Whatever has been declared as the result for a particular planet in ascendant the same is generated by the corresponding planet represented by the lord of the Navamsa sign. If the Navamsa is

owned by a benefic a portion of the army belonging to one party renders help to the army of the king who has come to attack.

शुभर्क्षेतन्नवांशे च यो याति मनुजेश्वरः ।  
शत्रुबलान्नेता साहाय्यमुपगच्छति ॥२२॥

The king who goes to conquer in the sign and Navamsa belonging to a benefic gets help from the army of the enemy.

यत्प्रोक्तं राश्युदये द्वादशभागेऽपि तत्फलं वाच्यम् ।  
यच्च नवांशकविहितं त्रिंशांशस्योदये तत्स्यात् ॥२३ ॥

Whatever has been declared as the results for the rising sign, the same is to be told as the result of the rising dwadasamsa. (dwadasamsa is 1/12th portion of a sign extending over 2° 30' ). What has been said as the result for the Navamsa, the same is to be told for Trimsamsa (1/30th portion of a sign extending over 1°) also.

उदयमुदयपं वा जन्मपं जम््म
र्भ वा  
तदुपचयग्रहं वा वीक्ष्य लग्ने यियासोः ।  
विनिहतमरिपक्षं विद्धि शत्रोरिदं वा  
यदि हिदुकसमेतं पृच्छऽतोस्तस्थितं वा ॥ २४॥

**Combinations Leading to Destructon of Enemies.** If the query lagna of the invader falls in the sign of his Janmalagna, or the Janmarasi, or an Upachayarasi counted from his natal ascendant or Moon sign or contains the lord of the ascendant at birth or the lord of the Moon sign, destruction of the enemy will be the result. If the said yoga in Ascendant falls in 4th house from the Ascendants etc. of the enemy or in the 7th from that of the querist the enemy is destroyed.

रात्रोर्हेरा राशिस्तदधिपतिर्जन्मभं तदीशो वा ।  
यद्यस्ते हिबुके वा तथापि शत्रुर्हतो वाच्यः ॥ २५॥

If the sign of the ascendant, its lord, janma rasi, or its lord in the horoscope of the enemy falls in the seventh or the fourth house of the chart of query, the death of the enemy is to be foretold.

क्षुत्तृष्णार्तिमार्गनाशोऽक्षिरोगः क्लेशस्याप्ति स्तिग्मगोः प्राग्विलग्ने ।  
शस्तं चान्द्रे देवतार्थं स्वदेशे कौजे पित्तव्यालशस्त्राग्निपीडाः ॥ २६ ॥  
बौधे तुष्टिवांछिताप्तिर्यशश्च जैवेऽर्थाप्तिः स्थानलाभरिनाशः ।  
स्त्रीरत्नाप्तिः कार्यसिद्धिश्च शौक्रे मान्दे वह्निव्याधिनीचापमानाः ॥२७॥

If the rising sign is possessed by the Sun, the traveller will be troubled by hunger and thirst, will lose his way, will have eye trouble etc. If by Moon travels in connection with worship of some deity, alone should be undertaken. The signs of Mars there will cause troubles from disorders of bile, serpents, weapons and fire. The signs of Mercury in the ascendant, will produce happiness, acquisition of desired objects and fame. The signs of Jupiter in the first house produce gains of wealth, status, and destruction of enemies. The signs of Venus on the ascendant cause acquisition of wife and gems and success in undertakings. If the rising sign is possessed by Saturn, there will be danger from fire and insult from low people.

वृषवृश्चिककर्कटैर्नृणामनुकूलैरपि लग्नमाश्रितैः ।  
गमनं च वदंत्यशोभनं मुनयोऽत्यर्क्षसमाश्रितैरपि ॥ २८ ॥

The sages have declared thus-Even though Taurus, Scorpio and Cancer are favourable for journeys they are inauspicious while falling on the ascendant or the 12th house.

मीने कुटिलो मार्गो भवति तदंशेऽन्यराशिलग्नेऽपि ।  
नो यानामाप्यलग्ने कार्य तेषां नवांशेऽपि ॥२६ ॥

If the ascendant, falls in the sign of Pisces or its Navamsa in any sign in lagna there will be confusion as to the direction of the destination or the correct path to be taken or there may arise other types of troubles and difficulties. One should not undertake a journey when the ascendant of travel falls in a watery sign or a watery

Navamsa.

*NOTE :* Cancer, Scorpio, capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are considered to be watery signs.

सर्व प्रमाण मुनिनोदितत्वात् किं त्वत्र होराबलमेव योग्यम् ।  
यस्मिन्सहस्रांशुरवस्थितोऽर्धतिर्यमुखी सागणयेत्ततोऽन्याः ॥३० ॥

**Discussion Regarding Hora:** All the rules discussed above, being the verdicts of sages are authentic by themselves. But it is worth while to consider the strength of Hora at the time of travel. \[Hora is of three kinds: (1) Tiryang mukhi = facing across, (2) Urdhvamukhi = facing upwards, (3) Adhomukhi = facing downwards. Hora is 1/2 a sign and extends over 15°. Each sign contains two horas\]. The hora in which the Sun is placed is to be reckoned Tiryangmukhi and the next horas in the order Urdhvamukhi, Adhomukhi, again Tiryangmukhi and so on.

*Illustration:* Suppose the Sun is in Kumbha Rasi 26°, and lagna in Aries 16°. What kind of Hora is the one in which the lagna falls?

Sun is to be assumed in T-hora. Then the horas of Pisces will be U and A. The first hora of Aries is again T. Lagna falls in the second hora of Aries. Therefore it falls in Urdhvamukhi hora.

धत्ते वांछितकार्यमूर्ध्व वदना क्लेशाद्विना लग्नगा ।  
क्लेशायासपरिक्षयांश्च कुरुते तिर्यमुखी गच्छतः ।  
सैन्यभ्रंशमधोमुखी प्रकुरुते कृच्छ्राद्गृहे चागमं  
सर्वाः पुष्टफलप्रदाः स्वपतिना दृष्टा पापग्रहैः॥३१॥

\[The results of Yatra Lagna falling in different kinds of hora are told now\]. If the lagna falls in U-hora[^3], objects are achieved with ease without any difficulty. T-hora[^4] there produces difficulties, efforts and losses. A-hora[^5] causes defeat and destruction of the army and makes return to home difficult. All the horas produce good results if they are aspected by their lords and are not aspected by malefic planets.

[^3]: "U-hora=Urdhvamukhi hora."

[^4]: "T=Tiryangmukhi hora. These abbreviations are adopted to avoid continuousrepetition."

[^5]: "A= Adhomukhi hora"

आरुद्रमीशारविभौमजीव  
विद्भार्गवैनीन्दव इत्यतोऽगुः ।  
यामार्धमिन्द्रानिलकालशंभु  
तोयाग्निचंद्रासुरमध्यतोऽन्यत् ॥३२॥

The lords of the directions from East to North are respectively the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn and the Moon. Yamardha Rahu resides during the first half (=duration of 3 hours) i.e. for 1¹/₂ hour in the direction of the lord of the day. In the nextप्रहर it moves to the sixth direction there from and so on.

*Illustration:* During Sunday, for the first 1¹/₂ hours Yamardha Rahu resides in the East. Then for the next 1¹/₂hours it will be in the sixth direction counted from East i. e., in North-West. Then for the next 1¹/₂ hours in the South. Next in the order North-East (ईशान कोण), West (तोय), South-East (अग्निकोण), North (चन्द्र) and Sough-West (असुर).

वार प्रवृत्तेर्घटिका द्विनिघ्नाः  

कालाख्यहोरापतयः शराप्ताः ।  
दिनाधिपाद्यारविशुक्रसौम्य  
शशांकसौरीज्यकुजाः क्रमेण॥३३ ॥

The time from the commencement of the day to the time in question is to be expressed in ghatikas and the same is to be multiplied by 2 and then divided by 5. From the quotient the number of hours elapsed, will be known. The lord of the next hour is the lord of the hour of query. Others are to be reckoned in the order the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars.

**ग्रन्थान्तरे**

वारादेर्घटिका द्विघ्नाः स्वाक्षत्दृच्छेषवर्जिताः ।  
सैका तष्टा नगैः कालहोरेशा दिनपात् क्रमात् ॥

Find out the number of ghatis elapsed from the Sun-rise to the moment of the query. Multiply it by 2 and divide it by 5. Deduct the remainder from the doubled number referred to above and add to the answer. Divide the answer by 7 and find out the remainder. The

remainder counted from the day of the query will give the planet governing the hour of the query.

**Example:** Suppose we desire to know the planet governing the Prashna with 6 ghatis as the Ishta on a Sunday. Six into two gives 12 which divided by 5 leaves 2. Deducting 2 from 12 we get 10. Adding 1 to 10 we have 11. Dividing 11 by 7 we get 4 as the remainder. 4 counted from Sunday gives us Mercury as the lord of the hour of query.

In reality the basis for the lordship of the planets over the hours of the day is the order of the planets in the heavens. Every day the duration of the first hour from the sun rise is governed by the planet governing that day. That of the 2nd hour belongs to the planet 6th to the governing planet and so on. For example, the first hour after sun rise belongs to the Sun on all Sundays. The 2nd belongs to Venus-the planet 6th to Sun, the 3rd to the planet 6th from Venus is to Mercury. The 4th to the planet 6th to Mercury is to Moon, the 5th to the planet 6th to Moon is to Saturn, the 6th to the planet 6th to Saturn is to Jupiter, the 7th to the planet 6th to Jupiter is to Mars. The 8th, 15th and 22nd hour will be governed by Sun, the 23rd by Venus, the 24th by Mercury.

The 25th hour belongs to the first hour of the next day and its lord will be one 6th to Mercury i. e. Moon. That is why Monday follows Sunday. Similarly the 25th hour on Monday will belong to Mars and so on. This is the rationale behind the naming of the days.

व्यतिपातविष्टिवैधृति पापग्रह लग्नदिवसेषु ।  
चौर्यावस्कंदानृतसंग्रामाः सिद्धिमायान्ति॥३४ ॥

A person gets success in such undertakings as theft, robbery, cheating and war if the same are performed during the Karanas Vyatipata, Bhadra and Vaidhriti, rise of ascendant possessed by a malefic planet and during the days of malefics.

*NOTE:* These times, mentioned above, are not considered auspicious for doing any auspicious work.

प्राच्यादि दिक्षु मेषाद्याः स्वपंचनवमैर्युताः ।  
तत्रगे वामिनीनाथे तदाशागच्छतोऽग्रतः ॥ ३५ ॥

The signs Aries, Leo and sagittarius are reckoned as representing the eastern direction; Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn in the South; Gemini, Libra and Aquarius in the West; and Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces in the North. In whatever sign is the Moon posited, that sign is considered to be facing the person on the

journey.

ओजदंडे पुरश्चन्द्रे पृष्ठे राहौ रणे जयः ।  
सिद्धिर्दक्षिणगे चन्द्रे हानिर्वामे परे मृतिः ॥३६ ॥

If परिघदण्ड is on the left, the Moon in the front, Rahu at the back, there will be victory in the war. If the Moon is on the right the object will be achieved. If it is on the left, there will be troubles and losses. If it be on the backside, death is sure in the war.

*NOTE :* For details, please refer to books on Muhurta.

If there is a strong planet in the 5th house to the planet who is the lord of the direction of journey that planet will prevent his travel in the desired direction but will make him travel in the direction ascribed to it.

न्न  

कुजात्रिकोणे रवितोऽथवेन्दुः ।  
यत्रोद्यतस्तंत्र न याति याता

Even if one among Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Saturn is placed in the 5th house from Mars or if the Moon is placed in the 5th or 9th house from the Sun, the person will not be able to go in the desired direction. The stronger of the two planets mentioned above will take him in the direction ascribed to it.

परस्परं सौरिकुजौ रवीन्दू त्रिकोणगौ भार्गवलोहितौ च ।  
फलं यदुक्तं तदशेषमेव विनाश्य पश्चात्स्वदिशं नताम् ॥ ३९ ॥

Saturn and Mars, or the Sun and the Moon, or Venus and Mars if placed mutually in trines (5th and 9th from each other) they destroy the results told previously but will make the person travel in their directions.

ताराग्रहश्चेत्सितिजात्रिकोणे सूर्यादपि स्वाद्यदि वा शशांकः ।  
दिगीश्वरात्पंचमगो बलीवा ग्रहः स्वकाष्ठां नयति प्रसत्य ॥४०॥

If Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are placed in trine to Mars or if the Moon is placed in trine to the Sun or if a strong planet is placed in the fifth place to the lord of the direction in which the querist desires to go, the person performs journey comfortably in the other direction.

One of the reasons can possibly be that we often read of the influence on the ascendant of the planets in the Kendras and the Konas. Hence the influence of the planet in the 5th Kona on the lord of the direction (lagna) is in consonance with the standard texts.

दष्टदृष्टफलाप्त्यै शास्त्रं हृदये निधाय मिहिरस्य ।  
दैवझवल्लभाख्यं दृष्ट्या प्रश्नं वदेत्तज्झः ॥४१ ॥

In order to discern the results visible and invisible, an astrologer should interpret queries after understanding the work on Horary science, bearing the name "Daivajnavallabha" composed by Mihira.

यदुपचितमन्यजन्मनि शुभाशुभं तस्य कर्मणः पक्तिम् ।  
व्यंजयति शास्त्रमेतत् तमसिं द्रव्याणि दीप इव ॥४२ ॥

This science of Astrology clearly shows the results of whatever merit and demerit has beenearned throngh one's actions in previous. birth, like a lamp which makes different things visible in darkness.

*NOTE:* Astrology is compared to a lamp. Our own ignorance of past actions is likened to darkness.

The illustrious Varahamihira, who was the son of Adityadasa, who got instructions and knowledge of the science of Astrology from his father (Aditya), who belonged to the gotra called Kapiththala, who got boons and blessings from the Sun God, and who was a native of the country of Avanti, composed this work after careful scrutiny of the opinions of different sages with great effort.

॥ २ ॥

Whether the result of the query will materialise in years or months etc., should be decided from the fact whether the lord of the Navamsa of the lagna at the query time represents hours, or months or fortnights etc. How many years, months etc., would be involved should then be decided on the basis of the number of Navamsas traversed in the lagna.
