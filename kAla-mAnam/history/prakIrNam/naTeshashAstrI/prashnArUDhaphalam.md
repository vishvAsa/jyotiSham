(Based on the axioms of Indian sages in PRAGNAANA DEEPIKAA (Sanskrit Classic) and JINENDRA MAALAI (Tamil Classic), this book helps answer questions and offer solutions regarding war and armies, wells and swimming pools, travel and ships, omens and dreams, cure of diseases, love, marriage and conjugal felicity, profit and loss, and misfortunes, and recovery of lost property. This will be of great interest to the West too.)**———————————————————————————————————————————————————**

***"Cowards die many times before their deaths;***





***The valiant never taste of death but once."***





 How true these words of Shakespeare in the mouth of Julius Caeser were in the case of Revered Pandit Brahmasri Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri. Here was a valiant man who braved poverty, braved the ridicule of the atheists; braved the obstruction of the orthodox, and the prejudice against Sanskrit, and with unique and single minded devotion rendered a signal service in the spread of the supreme Bhaaratiya wisdom.  
 Revered Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri, whose birth centenary was celebrated in 1978, had a great share in the religious and cultural Renaissance since his main work was in bringing the valuable treasures enbedded in the ancient literature to the attention of the general public and making them available in a language understood by the layman. It is an evidence of the broad culture and a significant sign of the changing times that he put before one and all without distinction of caste or community of religion, Vedic Madras such as the Taitreeya Aaranyakam. He had dedicated his life to this noble cause by translating the almost entire religious classics into Tamil and publishing more than 50 books along with the original texts in Devanaagari script.  






***BIRTH AND EDUCATION:***  
 Born on 5th October 1878 of the couple Rama Sastri and Meenaakshi Ammaal at Kadalangudi Village near Kumbakonam in Tanjaavur District in Tamil Nadu (India), he learnt Kaavyas, Naatakas, Alankaaras, Vyaakarana, Vedaanta, Astrology and Mantra Saastras. His Guru Bhakti was such that in very publication of his he got it printed that the rendering was by Mahaamahopaadhyaaya Vedaantakesari Brahmaasri Paingaanaadu Ganapati Sastri's disciple Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri.  






***ROLE OF EDUCATOR:***  
 In 1908 he started giving discourses at Tirunelveli on Advaita Vedaanta. From 1914 to 1916 he gave Vedaanta lessons in Travancore Samasthaanam. During the period he specialized in the study of and discussion on Bhaagavatam and Hindu Astrology. He was honoured by the Mahaaraajah of Travancore. On 25th July 1910 he was honoured by the Mahaaraja of Mysore. While introducing him to the Mahaaraajah, Dewaan V.P. Madhava Row remarked:





"Though young he is a man of exceptionally brilliant parts and wonderful grasp of the principles of the Vedaanta. I derived much benefit from his discourses. What I consider to be a special merit in the young man is his spirit of tolerance."  
The Sankaraachaaryaa of Kaanchipuram and Sringari Mutts also had conferred titles on him.




***THE TIMES IN WHICH HE EMERGED:***  
 As the beginning of the century Hindu orthodoxy was, to Shelley's words about catholicism, "only adoration, faith, submission, blind admiration, not a rule for moral conduct"; and Hindu Dharma was "a passion, a persuasion, an excuse, refuge, never a check according to the temper of the mind which it inhabited." The stalwards of the Hindu fold were unwilling to deal in a sympathetic spirit with the growing desire of those educated in English schools and colleges to get at the rationable of Hindu custom and usages; and in fact, they refused to encourage any such quest.  
 These led to the depforable result of alienating the English–educated Hindu altogether from that interest in ancient Indian knowledge which one would gladly have seen in their mental equipment and from the observance of those rites and ceremonials which from the indispensable discipline making for purity of thought and body, necessary for any spiritual development. Their example easily began to spread this lack of interest even among non–English educated men; for the former were taken to be the repositories of modern wisdom whom it would be unfashionable not to follow. But, fortunately, the tide has turned.  
 National leaders like Swami Vivekananda, Tilak, Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhi highlighted the salient points of India's hoary civilization and glorious culture inspired by the spiritual insight of her sages, and showed how a departure from which had resulted in her slavery to foreign domination. At such a time emerged on the scene the great Kadalangudi.

***JOURNALIST PAR EXCELLENCE:***  
 Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri settled down in Madras on 27th November 1917. Without much capital on hand he set up his own press and launched his monthly journal AARYAMATA SAMVARDHANEE, which met a long–felt need of the public. He popularized through his journal the rare ancient religious classics through the medium of reliable Tamil translation and propagated a knowledge of the significance of Hindu rituals, method of worship etc.


***GRAND PUBLICATIONS:***  
 The period 1923 to 1928 saw the publication of 9 Vedic books. 6 Upanishads. 4 Vols of Brahmasuutra Sankara Bhaashyam, 7 Vols. of Srimad Bhaagavatam, 12 Astrology books and more than 12 Stotra books. Each book carried a scholarly perface as lengthy as Bemard Shaw's detailed contents and an Index of Slokas to be of help to the users of the book; the Rt. Hon'ble Srinivasa Sastri echoed the thought of the otehr readers when he said Kadalangudi's footnotes were imaginative and considerate of the reader's difficulty.  
 The value of each book was enhanced by the author's collateral references which bring together all the learning on the subject and critical commentary at once admirable and most helpful. In the astrology books judgement based on the author's experience is also given wherever there are conflicting schools of thought. The meaning of the text is clearly andsuccinctly explained; the exposition is complete and authoritative.  
 No wonder his books are used for research guidance. His astrology books continue to be used as basic reference books by Tamil–knowing people all over the world.


***THE GREATNESS OF KADALANGUDI's  
TRANSLATION***

 Only those who are engaged in translation work can realize how arduous the work is; while the difficulty of communicating the ideas in one language through the medium of another is always difficult, it is still more difficult to translate a valuable abstruse work from Sanskrit into Tamil. Thiru Vi. Ka. opines thus:–  
 "Many will flinch from even undertaking the translation of such abstract and scholarly treatises. But this is what the learned Kadalangudi Sastriji has dared to do in a spirit of dedication and service, regardless of praise or blame. And it is wonderful how well he has done this superhuman task. Our mind does not permit us to state that Aachaarya Kadalangudi Natesa Sastriji is working at the translation purely from the standpoint of learning. But we can confidently affirm that he is labouring also from the standpoint of love that transcends all knowledge."  
 This swelling flood of translation flows from a source full of knowledge and love an it is the bounden duty of every Tamilian to drink it... South India was all the poorer for want of accurate translation of the great classics. But this want has now been supplied and the ideas in the classics, made accessible to the Tamil public by the Tamil translation so nobly undertaken by Aachaarya Kadalangudi Nate sa Sastri, that veteran scholar. We in the South owe him a deep dept of gratitude for this labour of love."  
 What is not widely known is that he was a great poet; he had left behind him a large number of Sanskrit verses which constituted his diary.  
 Around 1940 Kulapati K.M. Munshi invited him to become Principal of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Sanskrit College in Bombay, Kadalangudi declined it with thanks since he wanted to be self–employed and enjoy the accruing freedom to pursue his studies.




***RAJAJI'S TRIBUTE:***  
 While speaking at Kadalangudi's 'Sataabhishekam' function (completion of 81 years 4 months of age equivalent to 100 lunar years) at Siva–Vishnu Temple in Madras on October 11, 1958 Rajaji (who was of the same age) expressed as follows:





"The public need not bother to arrange another grand celebration of my 'Sataabhishekam'. Ideem it to have been celebrated along with this function in honour of the veteran scholar Revered Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri."  
Such was the mutual admiration and affection between the two intellectual giants.



***HIS END***  
 The Revered Pandit who laid the Indian public under deep obligation to him by publishing and propagating ancient works and making the most valuable contribution to the study of Advaita Vedaanta, Srimad Bhaagavatam, and Hindu Astrology attained immortality at the holiest of holy moments: at 11–30 p.m. on Mahaasivaraatri in 1961 (on Feb 14, 1961 at the Lingaavirbhava Lagna).  
***HIS MISSION***  
 Both in the several books and in his numerous lectures he had stood for the consolidation based on the vedas of the Hindu Dharma by ensuring social unity along with individual purity. He had been and continues to be a source of inspiration to many of his disciples who have profited by learning the gems hidden in the ancient classics, both philosophical and didactic, and which have a direct bearing on the practical conduct of everyday.  
***Dr. K.N. Saraswathy his Daughter and Disciple***  
 He had no sons and therefore he chose to give intensive training in the practice of Astrology to his youngest daughter K.N. Saraswathy, and training in exposition of epics and Naaraayaneeyam to his eldest son–in–law Anantaraama Deekshitar.  
 The great Pandit had no patience or time to lose with indifferent disciples or those without intuition, as far as astrology was concerned. Astrological study requiredmore intense concentration, capacity for application and intuition. So the only desciple who completed the course and internship in astrology under Kadalangudi was K.N. Saraswathy. Even after the course he was happy to have her as apprentice and collaborator in republishing the astrology books.

 The Science of Astrology is usually divided into three categories: calculation, horoscopy and inquiry. Determining the rising star at the time of birth and preparing the horoscope of the native and on this basis predicting the good and the bad effects that may ensue in the course of his life is called the art of horoscopy. But the Science of Inquiry (or 'PRASNA') is a more intriguing one.  
 A man loses his property all of a sudden; how does it happen? can he ever recover it? A person hides an object in his hand and inquires the astrologist whether he can declare what it is. Or he thinks of some object or idea; can the astrologist predict its nature, quantity and characteristics? That science which solves these enigmas is named Prasna. The means by which one is able to determine exactly the various configurations of the planets at one particular moment, whether in the present, past or future is called the science of calculation, All these three aspects of the science of astrology had to be mastered, if one is to make predictions correctly.  
 Having brought out publications on the science of horoscopy by translating ancient classical Sanskrit books on the subject, we now undertake the work of transcreating another classic entitled **Pragnaana** **Deepikaa** which deals with predictions in relation to questions asked now. We have supplemented this work by quoting from a Tamil classic on the subject under the title **JINENDRA** **MAALAI** at appropriate places.





 We will be failing in our duty if we do not acknowledge the encouragement given to us by the KARC Advisory committee.  
 We are particularly indebted to Professor B. Ardhanareeswarar for all his help and encouragement.  
 We are highly appreciative of the expeditious and efficient service done by the enthusiastic publisher Mr. M. A. Jaishankar, grandson of Revered Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri.

***PRASNA AAROODHAPHALA***  
**or**  
***PROBLEM–SOLVING ASTROLOGY***  




Chapter I






***INTRODUCTION***






 The first few verses of **Prasnaaroodha Phala** (**Pragnaana Deepikaa**) are an invocation to the deities:  






**शुक्लांबरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजम्।**





**प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत्सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये॥ १॥**






 It is essential to pray to the white–robed, the Moon–coloured, tusk–bearing God GaNapati who can clear all obstacles in the way. 1






**श्रीमद्गङ्गाधरसुतं चन्द्रलेखावतंसकम्।  
सिद्धिदं सर्वविद्यानां वन्दे दन्तावलाननम्॥२॥**






 I bow to the elephant–faced God GaNapati, beloved son of Lord Siva who carries the river Gangaa in his locks and the crescent (the Moon) on his head. This God will confer the gift of the fruits of all knowledge to the devotee. 2






**ज्ञानप्रदीपकं नाम शास्त्रं लोकोपकारकम्। **





**प्रश्नादर्शंप्रवक्ष्यामि सर्वशास्त्रानुसारतः॥३॥**






 I begin to narrate the Science of prediction entitled **Gnaana Deepikaa** which, like a mirror, reflects the truth and a knowledge of which is beneficial to the world. 3






**भूतं भावि वर्तमानं शुभाशुभनिरीक्षणम्।**





**पञ्चप्रकारमार्गञ्च चतुः केन्द्रबलाबलम्॥४॥**






 This science has a direct bearing on the following five categories, namely, the past, the present, the future, theaspects of good and bad planets, and the relative strengths of the four Kendras. 4






**आरूढछत्रवर्गञ्चाप्युद्गत्यादिबलाबलम्।  
क्षेत्रदृष्टिं नरं नारीं युग्मं वंशञ्च वर्णकम्॥५॥**  

 It talks of the divisions of 'AarooDha' and 'Chhatra the relative strengths of the ascendants, the aspects of the signs, the three genders masculine, feminine and neuter and also of ancestry and colour.  
* Note*: Just as planets have aspects, in this science of prediction, even signs aspect one another: 5






**मृगादिनर रूपाणि किरणानि च योजनम्। **





**आयुरासनमाद्यन्तं परीक्ष्य कथयेद्बुधः॥६॥**  

 A wise man therefore has to take into consideration all these indications and to investigate the forms of beasts and men, the degrees of planets and their distances, etc. before giving the prediction. 6






**चरस्थिरोभयं राशिं तत्प्रवेशस्थलानि च।  
निशा दिवस संध्याश्च काल देश स्वभावकान्॥७॥**






**धातुं मूलञ्च जीवञ्च नष्टं मुष्टिञ्च चिन्तनम्। **





**लाभालाभौ गदं मृत्युं भुक्तिं स्वप्नञ्च शाकुनम्॥८॥**











**जातकर्मायुधं शल्यं कूपं सेनागमं तथा। **





**सरिदागमनं वृष्टिटमर्धं नौसिद्धिमादितः॥९॥**











**कमेण कथयिष्यामि शास्त्रे ज्ञानप्रदीपके। **





**ज्ञानप्रदीपके शास्त्रे हिउपोद्धातः प्रकीर्तितः॥१०॥**






 The science of PraSna (Inquiry,) as narrated in **GNAANA PRADEEPIKAA** considers the peculiarities attributed to every Zodiacal sign, whether moveable, fixed or common and also the time of enquiry, whether day, night or twilight, and the place and other characteristics. It is able to give answers to the following issues, namely, loss of articles, hidden things, the idea or object one is thinking about, profit or loss, diseases, death, food, dreams, omens, past events, weapons, the arrival of armies, flow of rivers, rain, commodity prices, state of ships etc. etc. (7 to 10)

*Chapter II*  
***FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS***  


 I shall now declare the planetary relations–friendly or inimical.




**अथ वक्ष्ये विशेषेण ग्रहाणां मित्रनिर्णयम्। **





**भौमस्य मित्रे शुक्रज्ञौ बृगोर्झराऽ र्कमन्त्रिणः॥११॥**






MARS ... Venus and Mercury are friends; VENUS... Mercury, Mars, the Sun and Jupiter are friends; 11






**आङ्गारकं विना सर्वे ग्रहाः मित्राणि मन्त्रिणः। **





**आदित्यस्य गुरुर्मित्रं शनेर्विद्गुरुभार्गवाः॥१२॥**






JUPITER ... All planets except Mars are friends;  
SUN ...Jupiter is friend;  
SATURN ... Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are friends; 12






**भास्करेण विना सर्वे बुधस्य सुहृदस्तथा।  
चन्द्रस्य मित्रे जीवज्ञौ मित्रवर्ग उदाहृतः॥१३॥**






MERCURY ... All are friends except the Sun;





MOON ... Jupiter and Mercury are friends. 13











* Note*: Note that there is a contradiction between the planetary relations mentioned here and those in the scienceof horoscopy.






**मेषवृश्चिकयोर्भीमस्तुलावृषभयोस्सितः।**





**कन्यामिथुनयोस्सौम्यः शनिर्मकरकुम्भयोः॥१४॥**

 The 24 hours of the day are divided into 8 Yaamas, cach Yaama being therefore 3 hours. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, the Moon and Rahu are transiting in the eight directions in this regular order. When the Sun has risen in the East, Mars will be in south–east; Jupiter in the south, Mercury in south–west, Venus in the west, Saturn in north–west, the Moon in the north, and Rahu in the north–east. In the second Yaama (*i.e.* 9 a.m. to 12 noon) the Sun would have moved to south–east, and likewise all other planets would have moved regularly till we find Rahu in direct east. The directions of the planets will likewise change in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Yaamas. The movements of the planets in terms of the signs too can be determined thus. Each sign is divided into 4 paadas, and the 12 signs have 48 paadas. In each Yaama every planet has 6 paadas to move, i.e. in the first Yaama (6 to 9 a.m.) the Sun will be in movement in 4 paadas of Aries and 2 paadas of Taurus; while Mars will be in 2 paadas of Taurus and 4 paadas of Gemini and so on for other planets. 87

  From east to north–east are the planets posited from the 1st Yaama to the 8th Yaama of the day. The lord of the day is the Sun for Sunday, the Moon for Monday, Mars for Tuesday etc. In the first Yaama is the lord of the day in the east and he passes on to the south–east in the second Yaama and so on. At the time of enquiry one has to find out in
what direction the lord of the day is situated. In the next direction would be the lord of the next day and to the next is the lord of the succeeding day. That is, if in the first Yaama on Sunday the Sun is in the east, the next is the Moon in south–east, Mars in the south, Mercury in thesouth–west, Jupiter in the west, Venus in the north–westand Saturn in the north. 88

 The lords of the weekdays are stated by some to be respectively the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. But others affirm (as stated in verse 87) they are successively: the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, the Moon and Rahu. These planets are serving as base to determine past events, current events and future events.  
 On the day of PRASNA (*i.e.* enquiry or a question,) one has to count the number of signs the Moon is from the ascendant sign at the time of enquiry, and it is stated by some that it will take as many days for the fruition of their desires. Others are of the opinion that the number of signs the Navaamsa of the Moon is from the lord of the Navaamsa of the ascendant sign at the time of enquiry denotes the number of days taken for the fulfilment of their desires. 89






**प्रश्रे निश्चित्य घटिकाः सार्धद्विघटिकाः क्रमात्। **





**सार्द्धाद्विघटिपर्यन्तमर्कलग्नं प्रचक्षते॥९०॥**






 From sunrise to sunset the first hour is called Arka Lagna; the second hour is Kaala Lagna and so on; alternately, the day is divided into these two Lagnas. And these Lagnas have to be posited in the east, south–east, south etc. in regular order. From this one can determine at the time of enquiry–which direction it implies either as Arka or Kaala Lagna. This direction is to be taken as the Aaroodha direction and the lord of the planet there at the time can also be determined (according to either the 87th or 89th verse).90

 Take for example, the enquiry made at 1.1.35 a.m. which means that it falls in the Kaala Lagna in the north–west direction: Then we have to take this as Aaroodha Lagna in the north–west direction. According to the 89th verse, the lord of Aaroodha is Venus. One has to find out where Venus is posited at the time of enquiry, and the loss of property is to be decided in terms of that direction. 91

 Here is given some calculation which the student has to learn from his teacher. Having found the PRASNA Lagna. The Sphuta is to be calculated, and from this figure the Sun's Sphuta is to be subtracted. The remainder has to be converted into minutes, and the answer written in two places. From one figure 159 is to be subtracted. This answer is to be divided by three and to the quotient is to be added to the number of the week day on which the enquiry is made; and the whole is to be divided by 7. The remainder gives the number of the planet counted from the Sun onwards which is the lord of the Kaala Hora.  
 Take for example: The remainder from Prasna Lagna Sphuta after subtracting the Sun's Sphuta is 160 minutes and the day when the enquiry is made is Wednesday. After subtracting 150 from 160, the remainder is 10. If this 10 is again subtracted from 160 the remainder is 150. Dividing it by 3 we get the quotient 50. If this is added to 4, the number of Wednesday from Sunday, 54 is the answer. Dividing it by 7, we get the remainder 5—which number gives Thursday from Sunday. Hence Jupiter is the lord of the Kaala Hora. 92

 If a male Raasi is aspected by or associated with a male planet then one can predict about the loss of ornaments worn by men. In other places appropriate prediction is to be made in accordance with the nature of the signs and planets. The colour of the article is to be judged according to the strength of the planet and sign. If both are of equal strength, the result also will be of a mixed nature. 101 & 102

 There are other views in this matter. All benefic planets are stated to be related to thornless trees, and malefic planets to thorny ones. Of these the Sun is related to twin thorny plants and trees; Mars to stunted thorny plants and Saturn and Rahu to bent and crooked thomy ones.





 All malefic planets are thorny trees; Mercury is thick bushy plant; and Venus is thorn less tree. Plantain is ascribed to the Moon; tress growing on mountains and hills to the Sun; tall trees with long leaves like the coconut to Jupiter Saturn and Rahu are related to date palms and trees with sap or without sap.  
 Saturn, the Moon and the Sun are related to weak trees; while Venus and Jupiter to strong plants and trees. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Rahu, if posited in their own houses, refer to trees which look seemingly strong outside All planets in their own houses refer to real strong trees, which in other signs related to apparently strong trees, say some astrologists. 106 to 109






**त्वक्कन्दपुष्पछदनफलपक्वफलानि च।

 It is stated that of the five elements, aakaasa has only one attribute, namely, sound; and Vayu (wind) has two attributes sound and touch; fire has three attributes, namely, sound, touch and sight; water has the four qualities of sound, touch, sight, and taste. Finally the 5th element earth has the five qualities of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell. Referring then to the parts of the body, Jupiter corresponds to body, Venus tongue. Mercury to nose, Mars to eyes and Saturn to ears. Further Jupiter is analogous to bipeds, Venus to quadrupeds, Mercury to multiple–legged creatures, Mars to birds and Satum to crawling insects crustacheans, and frogs are stated to have no legs. Lice and bugs are stated to have many legs. Tortoise and Iguana are crawling animals. 120–121

 As Capricorn and Pisces are airy signs and if Saturn and Mars are posited there, one can predict that enquirer is thinking of the wild fowl or the crow. 122











**तद्राशिस्थे सिते हंसः शुकः सौम्ये विधौ शिखी।**





**वीक्षिते च तथा ब्रूयात् ग्रहे राशौ विचक्षणः॥१२३॥**






 If in those signs (Capricorn and Pisces) Venus is posited, the idea thought about is the swan; if Mercury, then the bird is parrot; if the Moon, the bird is peacock. The same is to be predicted if the above planets aspect the two signs Capricorn and Pisces. 123











**तद्राशिस्थे रवौ तेन दृष्टे ब्रूयात्खगेश्वरम्। **





**बृहस्पतौ सितबको भरद्वाजस्तु भोगिनि॥१२४॥**











 If the Sun is either posited on those signs or aspects them, the eagle will be the bird thought about. If it is Jupiter (posited or aspecting the 2 signs Capricorn and Pisces; it is the white heron; if it is Rahu then the bird is the long–tailed cuckoo; if it is Mercury, the cock; and if it is Venus the bird is the owl. 124

**शङ्खच्छेदी धातुचूर्णान्वेषिणः स्वर्णकारिणः॥१२८॥**






 If an exaltated sign is rising in the horizon and the Sun is posited there or aspecting it, the person thought about will either be a ruler of the earth or one associated with him; if the Sun is in Aries (his exalted sign,) and aspects the rising sign, the person thought about is a king or emperor; if the Sun is in his own house and aspects the rising sign, the person will be commander–in–chief; if the Sun is in friend's house and aspects the rising sign, the person will be one attached to the king; if the Sun is in neutral house and aspects the rising sign, the person will be a warrior. But if the rising sign is in any house other than Aries and is aspected by the Sun, the person thought about should be predicted in an appropriate fashion according to what is stated above; *i.e.* as one doing work on bronze, or a potter; or one sellingbronze ware; or a breaker of shells; or one seeking chemical powders; or a gold, smith etc, etc.126–128

 If a male Raasi is rising and it is aspected by Jupiter, prediction is to be made as stated in previous verses for the Sun, with the provison that the man to be seen will be a brahmin; and in the case of a male Raasi rising aspected by or associated with Mercury, the person to be seen will be an ascetic. 129                    
                                   
                       











**तद्वच्छुक्रे तु वृषलाः सङ्कराश्शशिभोगिनौ। **





**किञ्चिदत्र विशेषोस्ति मीने भास्करकिङ्कराः॥१३०॥**






 If the rising male Raasi is aspected by Venus, the person will be of lower class; and in the rising male Raasi aspected by the Moon or Rahu, the person will be of depressed class. But there are some special cases as in the following; 130






**चन्द्रस्प भिषजो ज्ञस्य वैश्याश्चोरगणाः स्मृताः। **





**राहोर्गरदचाण्डालास्तस्कराः परिकीर्तिताः॥१३१॥**






 If Aries is rising and aspected by the Sun the person will be a servant; if aspected by the Moon the person willbe a doctor; if aspected by Mercury, the person will be vaisya and a gang of thieves; if aspected by Rahu (some will say, the Moon) the person may be a poisoner a Chanadala or a thief. 131






**शनैस्तरुच्छिदः प्रोक्ताः राहोर्धीवरमालिनः। **





**शङ्खच्छेदी नटः कारुर्नर्तकाः शिल्पिनस्तथा॥१३२॥**






 If aspected by Saturn, the person will be a woodcutter; if aspected by Rahu, the person will be a fisherman; a flower–seller, a breaker of shells, a dancer, a handicraftsman, a carpenter, a washerman, or a sculptor. 132

**तत्तद्राशिवशाज्जातिस्तत्तद्राशिस्थितैर्ग्रहैः।**





**तत्तद्राशिस्थ खेटानां बलतो नष्टनिर्गमः॥२३३॥**






 If aspected by Venus, the person may be a seller of snuff or pearl–diver. The caste of the person is to be determined by judging the signs and the occupants of the signs. From the strength of the different planets, the finding of lost articles is to be determined. 133

***THE FINDING OF LOST ARTICLES***






**मेषराशिस्थिते भौमे मेषमाहुर्मनीषिणः।**





**तस्मिन्नर्के स्थिते व्याघ्रं गोलाङ्गूलं बुधे स्थिते॥२३४॥**






 If Mars is posited in Aries, the thought is about the loss of a goat; if the Sun is there, the thought is a Bengal tiger; if Mercury, it is a monkey. 134











**शुके गौर्वृषभश्चन्द्रे गुरावश्वस्ततः परस्।**





**महिषस्सूर्यतनये राहो गवय उच्यते॥२३५॥**






 If Venus is in Aries, the idea is a cow, if it is the Moon, the idea is a bull; if it is Jupiter, it is a horse; if Saturn, it is a buffalo; if Rahu, it is a deer. 135

 If Venus is in Libra, the idea in the mind is about the loss of a calf; if it is the Moon, the idea is a cow, if Jupiter,the Moon and Mars are in Sagittarius, the idea is a horse; if along with Saturn the Sun is also in Aquarius; the thought is about a mad elephant, if Rahu is in Aquarius, it is a buffalo; and if Mercury and Jupiter are in Aquarius it is a monkey. 139–140






**शुक्रामृतांशुसूर्येषु स्थितेषु पशुरुच्यते।**





**जीवसूर्येक्षिते गर्भो वन्ध्या रविजवीक्षिते। **





**अङ्गारकेक्षिते शुष्कमिति ज्ञात्वा वदेत्सुधीः॥१४१॥**






 If in Aquarius are posited Venus, the Sun and the Moon, the idea is a cow; if Jupiter and the Sun aspect Aquarius, it is a pregnant cow; if aspected by Saturn, it is a barren cow; and if aspected by Mars, it is an old cow with no more calving. Such predictions can possibly be made by a wise man. 141






**वक्ष्येहं चिन्तनां सूक्ष्मां जनैस्तु परिचिन्तिताम्। **





**धिषणे कुम्भराशिस्ये त्रिकोणेवाथ पश्यति। **





**स्मृतो गजस्तथा मीनधनुषी वीक्षिते शुभैः॥ २४२॥**






 If a person has something in his mind and he asks the astrologist to predict it, the method of detecting it is called ‘chintanaa’, which is detailed below:






 This is a subtle subject which is going to be described. If Jupiter is in Aquarius or in its trines, *i.e*. in Gemini andLibra, or if Jupiter aspects these signs, the person has an elephant in his mind; and the same answer can be given if benefic planets aspect Pisces and Sagittarius. 142











**स्मृतः कपिर्मेषगते शनौ ब्रूयान्मतङ्गजम्। **





**कुजे मेषगते छागः बुधे नर्तकगायकौ॥२४३॥**






 If Saturn is in Aries, the idea thought about is a monkey or an elephant. If it is Mars in Aries, the thought is a goat. If Mercury, is in Aries, it is a dancer or a singer 143











**गुरुशुक्रदिनेशेषु वणिजं वस्त्रजीविनम्।  
चन्द्रे तथा वदेन्मन्दे सिह्मस्थे रिपुचिन्तनम्॥ १४४॥**






 If Jupiter, Venus and the Sun are in Aries, the idea is a textile merchant; and the same is the answer if the Moon is in Aries; if Saturn is in Leo, the person is thinking of his enemy. 144






**वृषस्थे महिषो तौलौ चक्रिणं वृश्चिके गदम्। **





**मेषगे सूर्यतनये मृत्युक्लेशादयस्तथा।**





**मिन्नादिपञ्चवर्गञ्च ज्ञात्वा ब्रूयात्पुरोक्तितः॥१४५॥**






 If Saturn is in Taurus, he is thinking about a buffalo; if Saturn is in Libra, the idea is about a man with a wheel; if Saturn is in Scorpio, he is thinking of illness; if Saturn is in Aries, he is thinking of death and pain.Along with these, the astrologist has to take into consideration these five categories of a planet's friend, exaltation, own house, neutral and enemy; he has to give predictions in accordance with what is stated in verses 127 and 128. 145  

**धातुराशौ धातुखगैर्दृष्टे तच्छत्रसंयुते।**





**धातुचिन्ता भवेत्तद्वन्मूलजीवौ तथा वदेत्।**





**धातुभस्थे मूलखेटे जीवमाहुर्विपश्चितः॥१४६॥**






 If the Dhaatu Raasis (Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricom) are aspected by Dhaatu planets (Mars, the Moon and Saturn) or become Chhatra Raasis, the thought is stated to be about Dhaatus. The same is the case with Moola Raasis and Jeeva Raasis too; *i.e*. if they are aspected by Moola or Jeeva Raasis respectively or become Chhatra Raasis. Some pandits affirm that even if Moola planets (the Sun and Venus) are in Dhaatu Raasis, they are stated to be Jeevas. 146






**जीवराशौ मूलखगैर्दृष्टे वा युजि मूलकाः।**





**मूलराशौजीवखगैर्धातुचिन्ता प्रकीर्तिता॥१४७॥**






 If Jeeva Raasis are aspected by Moola, planets or associated with them, the thought is only about Moolas. If the Moola Raasis are aspected by the Jeeva planets, or associated with them, the thought is about Dhaatu products. 147











**त्रिवर्गखेटकैः दृष्टे युक्ते बलवशाद्वदेत्।**





**पश्यन्ति चन्द्रञ्चेदन्ये वदेत्तत्तद्ग्रहाकृतिम्॥१४८॥**  

 As stated above, if the three kinds of Raasis Dhaatu Moola and Jeeva are aspected by or associated with any of the three kinds of planets, Dhaatu, Moola or Jeeva, prediction about the idea thought about should be made after considering the strength of the various planets. If other planets aspect the Moon, the size of the planets (as stated in verses 68 & 69) is to be considered and their respective products predicted. 148











**धातुं मूलञ्च जीवञ्च वंशं वर्णं स्मृतं वदेत्।**





**उदयारूढयोश्छत्रे ग्रहयोगेक्षणात्तथा॥१४९॥**






 One has to take into consideration the qualities and attributes of the rising sign, the Aaroodha Raasi, and the sign where the Moon is posited and the nature of the planets associated with or aspecting these. Then prediction is to be made in respect of the idea thought about in terms of Dhaatu, Moola, Jeeva, caste colour etc. described in verses 97 to 101. 149











**ज्ञात्वा नष्टञ्च मुष्टिञ्च चिन्तनां क्रमशो वदेत्। **





**कण्टकादिचतुष्के तु स्वोत्वमित्रग्रहैर्युते। **





**दृष्टे वा सर्वकार्याणां सिद्धिं ब्रूयाच्च चिन्तिताम्॥ १५०॥**











**उदये धातुचिन्ता स्यादारूढे मूलचिन्तनम्।**





**छत्रेषु जीवचिन्ता स्यादिति कैश्चिदुदाहृतम्॥१५१॥**











**केन्द्रं पणफरं प्रोक्तमापोक्लिममिति क्रमात्। **





**चिन्तनामुष्टिनष्टानि कथयेत्कार्यसिद्धये॥१५२॥**






 The loss of an article, the hidden article in the fist or the idea thought about are to be predicted thus; If the planets are in quadrants (the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places) and if the planets are in their own houses, or in. friendly signs or in exaltation or if they aspect the quadrants (the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places; the desired result will come into effect. From the rising Lagna, all ideas about Dhaatus from Aaroodha Lagna and thoughts about Moola and from Chhatra Raasi everything about Jeeva can be predicted. By studying the quadrants (the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) the idea thought about can be predicted by studying the Panapharas (the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses), the article hidden in the fist can be stated, by studying the Aapoklimas (the 3rd, 9th, 6th and 12th places) the loss of an article can be traced from these, the success of the venture can be determined.  
 From verse 122 to verse 152 the methods of determining the loss of property or the idea thought about are detailed, and one has to apply them appropriately as the occasion demands before prediction. 150–152

**Chapter VI**






***ON AAROODHA***








**तत आरूढगे चन्द्रे न नष्टं रुद्धशाश्वती।**





**आरूढाद्दशमे वृद्धिञ्चतुर्थे पूर्ववद्वदेत्।  
नष्टद्रव्यस्य लाभश्व सर्वहानिश्च सप्तमे॥१५३॥**  

 If the Moon is in the Aaroodha Raasi, there is no loss of property; it is only hidden from sight for the time being; it is indestructible and can be found.  
 If the Moon is in the 10th house from the Aaroodha Lagna there will be increase of profit; if it is in the 4th house, the prediction is as stated earlier, *i.e.* lost property can be recovered but if it is in the 7th house, loss of property is to be predicted. 153











**उदयाद्वादशे षष्ठेऽष्टम आरूढके सति।  
चिन्तितार्थो न भवति धनहानिर्द्विषद्वलम्॥१५४॥**






 If the rising Lagna is either in the 12th, 8th or 6th house from Aaroodha Lagna, the lost property cannot be recovered. In addition to financial loss, the enemy will be strengthened. 154











**तनुं कुटुम्बं सहजं जननीं तनयं रिपुम्।**





**कलत्रं निधनं चैव गुरुं कर्म फलं व्ययम्। **





**उदयादिक्रमाद्भावं तस्य तस्य फलं वदेत्॥१५५॥**






 The respective effects of the position of the rising Lagna, in relation to the Aaroodha Lagna are as follows: in the first house, it is related to the body; in the 2nd, family; in the 3rd, brothers; in the 4th, mother; in the 5th, children; in the 6th, enemy; in the 7th, spouse; in the 8th, death; in the 9th, perceptor; in the 10th, work; in the 11th, gain; and in the 12th expenses. 155






**रवीन्दुशुक्रजीवज्ञा नृराशिषु यदा स्थिताः।**





**मर्त्यचिन्ता ततः सौरिदृष्टे नष्टं कुजे तथा।**





**कुजस्य कलहः सौरेस्तस्करं गरलं वदेत्॥१५६॥**






 If the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Jupiter and Mercury are male Raasis, the idea thought about is men; if the rising Lagna is aspected by Saturn and has relations with Mars, the idea is about lost property; if the rising Lagna is only having relation with Mars, the idea is about strife or conflict; if it is only aspected by Satum, the idea is about thieves or poisoning. 156











**रविदृष्टे तथायुक्ते चिन्तना देवभूपयोः।**





**शुभचिन्ता गुरौ ज्ञेया विवाहो बुधशुक्रयोः॥१५७॥**






 If the rising Lagna is either associated with or aspected by the Sun, the idea in the enquirer's mind is about a king or god; if aspected by or associated with Jupiter, the idea is about noble and good things; and if associated with or aspected by Mercury or Venus, the person is thinking about marriage matters. 157

**Chapter VII**






***ON CHHATRA RAASI***






**द्वितीये द्वादशे छत्रे सर्वं कार्यं विनश्यति।**





**गुरौ पश्यति युक्ते वा तत्र कार्यं शुभं वदेत्॥१५८॥**











 If the Chhatra Raasi is in the 2nd place or the 12th place to Prasna Lagna or Aaroodha Lagna, all undertakings will fail. But if Jupiter is in Chhatra Raasi or aspects it, all work will be successful. 158






**तृतीयैकादशे छत्रे सर्वं कार्यं शुभं वदेत्।**





**तस्मिन्पापयुते दृष्टे विषयं भवति ध्रुवम्॥१५९॥**






 If the Chhatra Raasi is in the 3rd or 11th place to Prasna Lagna or Aaroodha Lagna all undertakings will be successful. But if a malefic is posited in or aspects the Chhatra Raasi there will be certain failure of any work undertaken. 159






**तस्मिन्सौम्ययुते दृष्टे सर्वं कार्यं शुभं वदेत्। **





**मिश्रे मिश्रफलं ब्रूयाच्छास्त्रे ज्ञानप्रदीपके॥१६०॥**






 If a benefic planet is posited in or aspects the Chhatra Raasi all enterprises will meet with success. If both benefic and malefic planets have connection with the Chhatra Raasi,the science of Pragnaana Pradeepikaa teaches that the results will be of mixed nature. 160











**पञ्चमे नवमे छत्रे सर्वसिद्धिर्भविष्यति।**





**तद्वच्छुभाशुभैर्दृष्टे मिश्र मिश्रफलं भवेत्॥१६१॥**











 If the Chhatra Raasi happens to be the 5th or the 9th sign all undertakings will be successful. If it is associated with a benefic planet, success will corne; and if with a malefic planet failure would be the result. But if both malefic and benefic planets are there, the result will be of a mixed character. 161











**द्वितीये चाष्टमे षष्ठे द्वादशे छत्रसंयुते।**





**नष्टद्रव्यागमो नास्ति न व्याधिशमनं भवेत्।**





**न कार्यसिद्धिर्नद्वेषशान्तिर्गृहवशाद्भवेत्॥१६२॥**











 If the Chhatra Raasi is in the 2nd, 8th, 6th or 12th house, the lost property cannot be recovered; diseases also will not be cured; the wished for fruit cannot be attained; and enmity will not cease. 162

**Chapter VIII*  
**ON THE RISING RAASI***






**वृहस्पत्युदये श्रेयो धनं विजय आगमः।**





**द्वेषशान्तिस्सर्वकार्यसिद्धिरेव न संशयः॥१६३॥**






 If Jupiter is posited in the rising Raasi, good will result; more property and victory wiill come; ill–will and enmity die; and all enterprises will certainly succeed. 163






**सौम्योदये रणोद्योगी जित्वा तद्धनमाहरेत्।**





**पुनरेष्यति सिद्धिस्स्याच्चन्द्रसन्दर्शने तथा।**





**व्यवहारे च विजयश्छत्रे प्येवमुदाहृतम्॥१६४॥**











 If Mercury is in the rising Raasi, the warrior will defeat his foe and come back with the ( victor's) spoils. If the Moon aspects the rising Raasi, the man who goes out to accomplish a work will come back with achievement, he will succeed in litigation. The same good result will be there if Jupiter, Mercury and the Moon are in Chhatra Raasi. 164






**चन्द्रोदयेऽर्थलाभश्वोपायेनागमनन्तथा।  
चिन्तितार्थस्य लाभश्च छत्रारूढस्थितेपि च॥१६५॥**






 If the Moon is posited in Udaya (rising) Raasi, the person will gain property by many ways and get his desiredends. The same prediction can be given if the Moon is in Chhatra Raasi or Aaroodha Raasi. 165











**शुक्रोदयेऽर्थसिद्धिस्स्यात् स्त्रीलाभो व्याधिमोचनम्।**





**चयो यान्त्यरयस्स्नेहं छत्रेप्येवमुदाहृतम्॥१६६॥**











 If Venus is in Udaya Raasi, there will be gain in property, acquisition of woman, curing of illness, victory and friendliness with erst–while foes. The same will happen if Venus is in Chhatra Raasi. 
166











**उदयारूढछत्रेषु शन्यर्काङ्गारका यदि।**





**अर्थनाशं मनस्तापं मरणं व्याधिमादिशेत्॥१६७॥**











 If Saturn, the Sun or Mars is in Udaya, Chhatra or Aaroodha Raasi, there will be loss of property, ill–will and unfriendliness, illness and death.                                
               167











**एतेषु फणियुर्क्तेषु बन्धं चोरभयं गरम्।  
मरणं चैव दैवज्ञो न सन्दिग्धो वदेत्सुधीः॥१६८॥**






 If Rahu is associated with the Udaya, Chhatra or Aaroodha Raasi, there will be bondage, fear of thieves, poisoning and even death. 168






**निधनारिभ्रनस्थेषु पापेष्वशुभमादिशेत्।  
एषु स्थानेषु केन्द्रेषु शुभास्स्युश्चेच्छुभं वदेत्॥१६९॥**






 If malefics are in the 2nd, 9th or 8th places, misery is to be predicted. But if benefics are posited in those places or in Kendras, prosperity is to be predicted. 169

***ABOUT LOST PROPERTY***












**तुलोदये क्रियारूढे नष्टसिद्धिर्न संशयः।**





**विपरीते न नष्टाप्तिर्वृषारूढेऽलिभोदये।**





**नष्टसिद्धिर्महालाभो विपरीते विपर्ययः॥१७१॥**






 If Libra is Udaya Raasi and Aries the Aaroodha Raasi, the loss of property will certainly be recovered. If it is the reverse, i.e. Aries is Udaya Raasi and Libra the Aaroodha Raasi, the property cannot be recovered.  
If Scorpio is Udaya Raasi and Taurus the Aaroodha Raasi not only will the lost property be recovered but additional gains will accrue. If it is otherwise, *i.e.* Scorpio, the Aaroodha Raasi and Taurus the Udaya Raasi, the lost property cannot be regained. 171











**चापारूढे नष्टसिद्धिर्भविता मिथुनोदये।  
विपरीते न सिद्धिस्स्यात्कर्कारूढे मृगोदये। **





**सिद्धिश्च विपरीते तु न सिद्ध्यति न संशयः॥१७२॥**






 If Gemini is Udaya Raasi and Sagittarius the Aaroodha Raasi one can regain the lost property. In the reyerse case, the lost property cannot be traced. If Capricom is AaroodhaRaasi and Cancer the Udaya Raasi, "there will be success in the venture. In the reverse case, *i.e.* Cancer the Aaroodha and Capricom Udaya Raasi, failure will be the result. 172






**सिह्मोदये घटारूढे नष्टसिद्धिर्न संशयः। **





**विपरीते न सिद्धिस्स्याज्झषारूढेङ्गनोदये। **





**नष्टसिद्धिर्विपर्यासे दृष्टादृष्टे निरूपयेत्॥१७३॥**











 If Leo is Udaya Raasi and Aquarius the Aoroodha Raasi, there will be certainty of regaining lost property. In the reverse case of Leo being Aaroodha and Aquarius the Udaya Raasi, one cannot regain the property. If Virgo is Udaya Raasi and Pisces Aaroodha there will be success in regaining the property. In the reverse case of Virgo the Aaroodha and Pisces Udaya, failure will be the result. 173











**स्थिरोदये स्थिरारूढे स्थिरच्छत्रं भवेद्यदि।  
न मृतिर्नच नष्टञ्च न रोगशमनं तथा॥१७४॥**






 If the Udaya, Aaroodha and Chhatra are in fixed Raasis, and the enquirer asks about death, there will be no death; if he asks about lost property, he will get back that property; and if he asks about illness, he will not be cured of it. 174











**द्विदेहभोदयारूढे छत्रे नष्टं न सिद्ध्यति।  
न व्याधिशमनं शत्रोत्सन्धिं विद्यान्नचस्थिराम्॥१७५॥**











 If the Udaya, Aaroodha and Chhatra are in common Raasis, and the querist asks about lost property, he will not get back that property; if about illness, it will not be cured; and if about enmity, the truce arrived at between the parties cannot last long. 175











**चरराश्युदयारूढछत्रेषु स्त्र्यादिसिद्धयः।  
नष्टसिद्धिश्च भवति व्याधिशान्तिश्च जायते॥१७६॥**











 If Udaya, Aaroodha and Chhatra are in moveable Raasis, there will certainly he success in all fields; gain of a woman, recovery of lost property, curing of diseases, and accomplishment of all enterprises undertaken. 176  

**सर्वागमनकार्याणि भवन्त्येव न संशयः।**





**ग्रहस्थितिबलेनैव सर्वं ब्रूयाच्छुभाशुभम्।  
चरोदये स्थितास्सौम्यास्सर्वकार्यार्थसाधकाः॥१७७॥**











 Good or bad results are to be predicted by proper assessment of the strength of the various planets in the different Raasis. If the Udaya Lagna is in moveable Raasis and benefic planets are posited therein, all kinds of work undertaken will succeed. 177











**आरूढछत्रलग्नेषु क्रूरेष्वस्तङ्गतेषु च।**





**परेणापहृतं ब्रूयात्तत्सिद्ध्यति शुभेषु च॥१७८॥**






 If malefics or eclipsed planets are posited in Aaroodha, Udaya or Chhatra Raasis, the lost property must have been taken away by some one and no hope is there of recovery. But if benefics are there, hope of recovery can be predicted. 178  

**नवमे पञ्चमेस्ते च नष्टलाभः शुभोदये।**





**एषु पापे न नष्टाप्तिरुदयादित्रिकेषु च॥१७९॥**











 If benefics are in the 5th, 7th or 9th place from Aaroodha, Udaya or Chhatra Raasi, the lost property can be recovered. By determining the condition of the planets, benefic or malefic, weak or strong, in the Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra Raasis, the possibility of recovery or otherwise of lost property can be predicted. 179






**भ्रातृस्थानयुते पापे पञ्चमे वाशुभेक्षिते।**





**नष्टद्रव्याणि केनापि दीयन्ते स्वयमेव च॥१८०॥**











 If even a malefic is in the 3rd house or a benefic in the 5th house from the Udaya, Aaroodha or ChhatraRaasi the man who has taken the property will, of his own accord, return it. 180  

**प्रश्नकाले शुभेपापे धूमेन परिवेष्टिते।**





**नष्टं नष्टे न भवति तत्तदाशासु तिष्ठति॥१८१॥**



 If a benefic or a malefic planet is associated with the Upagraha Dhooma at the time of Prasna the alleged lost property is not lost but is intact in the direction indicated by the planet. 181




**पृष्ठोदये शशाङ्के तु नष्टद्रव्यं न गच्छति।**





**तद्राशिश्शनिदृष्टश्चेन्नष्टं व्योम्नि कुजे न तत्॥१८२॥**






 If at the time of Prasna the Moon is in the Prishthodaya sign (Arics, Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius or Capricorn) the alleged 'lost' property is not lost but is somewhere in the house itself. If that sign is aspected by Saturn the article is in a high place, and if that sign has any relation with Mars it is not in the high place. 182  

**वृहस्पत्युदये स्वर्णे नष्टं नास्तीति निर्दिशेत्।**





**शुक्रे चतुर्थगे रौप्यं नष्टं न भवति धूवम्॥१८३॥**



 If Jupiter is in the Udaya Lagna, the lost property is a golden article, but really it is not lost; if Venus is in the 4th place from Udaya Lagna, the alleged lost article is a silver one, and really it is not lost. 183



**अस्ते कुजे शनौ कृष्णलोहं नष्टं न जायते।**





**वुधोदये त्रपु प्रायो नष्टं नास्ति चतुर्थगे॥१८४॥**











 If Saturn or Mars is in the 7th place, the lost article is an iron one, and it is not lost; if Mercury is in the UdayaRaasi or in the 4th place from it, the lost article is a tin or zinc one, and it is not lost. 184






**कांस्यं नष्टं न भवति पङ्कनाभौ च सप्तमे।**





**आरकूटं पञ्चमस्थे भानौ नष्टं न जायते॥१८५॥**






 If the Moon is in the 7th place, the lost article is a bronze one and really it is not lost; If the Sun is in the 5th place, the lost article is made of brass and really it is not lost. 185  

**दशमे पापसंयुक्ते न नष्टाश्च चतुष्पदाः।  
चतुष्पदोदये राहौ स्थिते नष्टाश्चतुष्पदाः॥१८६॥**











 If malefics are associated in the 10th place, the lost one is an animal and really it is not lost; and if the Udaya Raasi is a quadruped sign and Rahu is posited therein, the animal is to be considered as lost. 186











**बन्धनस्था भवेयुस्ते तद्वद्विपदराशयः।  
बहुपादुदये राहौ बहुपान्नष्टिमादिशेत्।  
पक्षिराशौ पदा नष्टमेतेषां बन्धनं भवेत्॥१८७॥**  

If the Udaya Raasi is a biped sign and if Rahu is posited therein a human being is in jail (or in bondage) and if the Udaya Raasi is a multifooted sign and if Rahu is posited there the animal is lost. If the Udaya Raasi is a bird signand Rahu is there, the above predictions have to be stated namely, that the man will be in jail and the animal in the pound. 187






**कर्कवृश्चिकयोर्लग्ने नष्टं सद्मनि कीर्तयेत्।**





**मृगमीनोदये नष्टं कपोतान्तरयोर्वदेत्॥१८८॥**











 If Cancer or Scorpio is the Udaya Lagna, the lost article is in a loft or in the middle of the house. 188











**कलशे भूमिजस्सौम्यो घटे रक्तघटे गुरुः।  
शुक्रश्च करके लग्ने घटे भास्करनन्दनः॥१८९॥**






**आरनालघटे भाण्डे चन्द्रो लवणभाण्डके।**





**नष्टद्रव्याश्रितं स्थानं सद्मनीति विनिर्दिशेत्॥१९०॥**











 If Mars is in the Udaya Lagna, the lost article will be in a pot; if it is Mercury it is certainly in a pot; if it is Jupiter the article is in a red–clay pot; and if it is Venus, it is in the water jug; and if it is Saturn the article is in rice–cleansed water; and if it is the Moon the article will be in the salt jug. 189–190






**पुंराशिः पुङग्रहैर्दृष्टः पुरुषस्तस्करो भवेत्।  
स्त्रीराशिः स्त्रीग्रहैदृष्टः तस्करी च वधूर्भवेत्॥१९१॥**






 If male Raasis are aspected by male planets, the thief is a man. Likewise if female Raasis are aspected by female planets, the thief is a woman. 191






**उदयादोजराशिस्थे पुङ्ग्रहे पुरुषो भवेत्।**





**समराश्युदये चोरी समस्थे स्त्रीग्रहे वधूः।**





**उदयारूढयोश्चैव बलाबलवशाद्वदेत्॥१९२॥**











 If from the Udaya Raasi a male planet is in an odd number sign the thief is a man. If the Udaya Raasi is an even number sign, and if from that a female planet is in an even sigin the thief is a woman. What is stated is to be considered in the light of the strength of the Udaya and Aaroodha signs. 192











**कर्किनक्रपुरन्ध्रीषु नष्टद्रव्यं न सिध्यति।**





**तुलाबृषभकुम्भेषु नष्टद्रव्यं च सिध्यति।  
जीवं विना सर्वखगे सपत्नस्थे न सिध्यति॥१९३॥**











 If Cancer, Capricorn and Virgo are the Udaya signs, the lost property cannot be recovered. If Libra, Taurus and Aquarius are the Udaya signs, the lost property can be restored. Excepting Jupiter if any other planet is in an inimical sign, the lost article cannot be obtained. 196











**पश्यन्ति ये ग्रहाश्चन्द्रं चोरास्तत्तुल्यरूपिणः।**





**द्रव्याणि च तथैव स्युरिति ज्ञात्वा वदेत्सुधीः॥१९४॥**






 Whatever planet aspects the Moon, the thief will havethe features of that planet. The stolen article too will have some semblance to that planet. 194











**यस्यामारूढभं याति तस्यां दिशि गतं वदेत्।**





**तत्तद्ग्रहांशुसङ्ख्यानि तत्तत्सङ्ख्यादिनादिकम्।**





**स्वभावकवशादेव मन्यदृष्टिंवशाद्वदेत्॥१९५॥**











 The lost article will be in that direction in which the Aaroodha sign is situated. The time taken to recover the lost property can be reckoned in terms of days according to the rays of the planets concerned, or the months and years of the planets according to the circumstances of the case. Accordingly prediction is to be made taking into consideration the nature of the planets and of those aspecting the Aaroodha, Udaya and Chhatra signs. 195











**चन्द्रस्थर्क्षादुदयभं यावत्तावत्फलं वदेत्।**





**चरस्थिरोभयवशादेकद्वित्रिगुणो भवेत्॥१९६॥**











The number of signs separating the Udaya Raasi from the house in which the Moon is situated gives the number of days by which success will be effected. If the signs of the Moon and the Udaya Lagna are moveable signs, the above number gives the days for fruition of the prediction. If they are fixed signs, the number has to be trebled. 196

***OF GAIN AND LOSS***











**सुवस्तुलाभं राज्यञ्च राष्ट्रलाभं स्त्रियः पतिम्।**





**उपायनं स्वकार्याणां लाभालाभौ वदेत्सुधीः॥१९७॥**











**उदयादित्रिकान्खेटाः पश्यन्त्युश्चेश्वरा यदि।**





**चिन्तितार्थागमाश्चैव स्त्रीलाभो राज्यसिद्धयः॥१९८॥**











**तान्नीचद्वेषिणो खेटाः पश्यन्ति यदि नाशयेत्।**





**एवं विवाहकार्येच शुभाशुभनिरूपणम्॥१९९॥**






 If planets in exaltation aspect the Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra signs, gain of valuable goods, even of, kingdoms is to be predicted. For females, gain of a husband, rewards, achievement of tasks undertaken and obtaining of desired things can be predicted. For males, gaining a wife and obtaining a job will be predicted by wise men. If however planets in debilitation or inimical planets aspect the Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra signs the reverse of the above predictions is indicated. That is, there will be loss all around. Likewise, prediction is to be made regarding marriage. 197–199











**उदयारूढछत्राणि पश्यन्ति सुहृदो यदि।**





**शत्रुर्मित्रत्वमायाति रिपुः पश्यति चेद्रिपुः॥२००॥**











 If the lords of the Udaya, Aaroodha and Chhatra signs are aspected by benefic planets, even an enemy will become a friend. If however, malefic planets aspect them, even a friend will become an enemy. 200











**उदयञ्चन्द्रलग्नञ्च रिपुः पश्यति वा युतः।  
आयुर्हानी रिपुस्थानं गतश्चेद्बन्धनं भवेत्।**





**गतो न यदि नष्टञ्चेब्दहिरेव गतं वदेत्॥२०१॥**











 If a malefic planet either occupies or aspects the Udaya Lagna or the Moon's sign, there will be decline in longevity; if they occupy an inimical sign, there will be bondage (*i.e.* imprisonment). If the Moon does not reach an inimical sign, the lost property has been taken out. 201











**बलवच्चन्द्रजीवाभ्यां केन्द्रेषु सहितेषु च।**





**नष्टप्रश्नेन नष्टं स्यात् मृत्युप्रश्नेन नश्यति।**





**पापदृष्टे युते केन्द्रे ब्रूयात्तस्य विपर्ययम्॥२०२॥**











 If a strong Moon or Jupiter is in Kendra and a query is asked at that time, if it is with regard to loss of property, prediction can be made that there is no loss. If it is about death, it can safely be said that there will be no death. Ifhowever, malefics are either posited in or aspecting the Kendras, the reverse prediction is to be made *i.e.* the property cannot be recovered, and death may take place. 202






**शत्रोरागमनं नास्ति चतुर्थे पापसंयुते।  
दशमैकादशे सौम्यग्रहाश्चेत्सर्वसिद्धयः॥२०३॥**






 If malefics are in the 4th place, the enemy dare not come. If benefics are in the 10th an 11th places, all enterprises undertaken will be successful. 203






**उदयारूढछत्रेषु केन्द्रेषु भुजगो यदि।**





**दूरस्थितो नचाऽऽयाति बद्धो भविष्यति॥२०४॥**











 If Rahu is posited in Udaya, Aaroodha and Chhatra Paasis or in their trines, the person who has gone far away from home will not return. He may be in bondage there. 204






**विषादिपीडा प्रश्नेतु रोगिणो मरणं भवेत्।**





**गमनं विद्यते प्रष्टुर्नास्तीति कथयेद्बुधः।**





**प्रारब्धकार्यहानिस्स्याद्धनस्यापत्तिरीरिता॥२०५॥**











 If in the above case, questions relating to poison are asked, the person will die. The enquirer would go to the place where the person is confined, but his presence wouldbe of no avail; there would be loss of property and all undertakings would fail. 205






**चन्द्राद्व्योमस्थिते शुक्रे जीवाद्व्योमस्थिते रवौ**





**तल्लग्ने कार्यसिद्धिस्स्यात्पृच्छकानां न संशयः॥२०६॥**











 If Venus is in the 10th place from the Moon and if the Sun is in the 10th place from Jupiter at the time of Prasna all kinds of work undertaken by the enquirer would succeed. 206











**उदयात्सप्तमे व्योम्नि शुक्रश्चेत्स्त्रीसमागमः।**





**धनागमश्च सौख्यञ्च चन्द्रेऽप्येवं प्रकीर्तितम्॥२०७॥**











 If Venus is in the 7th or 10th place from the Udaya Lagna, there will be conjugal bliss, addition to wealth and prosperity. The same good results will accrue if the Moon is in the 7th or 10th place from the Udaya Lagna. 207











**मित्रस्वात्युच्चमायान्ति यदा खेटास्तदेष्टदाः।**





**नीचारिबलयोगाभ्यां सर्वकार्यविनाशनम्॥२०८॥**











 When the planets reach their friend's house, or are in own house or in very high exaltation then they confer all good benefits; and when they are in debilitation or in their enemy's house, all kinds of work will meet with failure. 208

**ChapterXI**






***ON DISEASES***






**पूर्वशास्त्रानुसारेण व्याधिमृत्युविनिर्णयः।**





**षष्ठो य उदयाद्व्याधिरष्टमो मृत्युसंज्ञकः।  
तत्र षष्ठे व्याधिचिन्ता निधने मृत्युचिन्तना॥२०९॥**






 Predictions about diseases and death are made in terms of the Saastraic rules. The 6th sign from Udaya Lagna indicates disease, and the 8th sign, death. 209











**तत्तदूग्रहयुते दृष्टे व्याधिं मृत्युं वदेक्रमात्।**





**पापनीचारयः खेटाः पश्यन्ति यदिसंयुताः।  
न व्याधिशमनं मृत्युं प्रविचार्य वदेत्सुधीः॥२१०॥**











 Whatever planets are in association with or aspecting the 6th and 8th signs, predictions regarding diseases and death are to be made. Even if malefics or debilitated planets or inimical planets are posited in or aspecting the 6th; and 8th houses, diseases would not be cured, nor death prevented. 210











**एतयोश्चन्द्रभुजगौ तिष्ठतो यदि चोदये।  
गरादिना भवेद्व्याधिर्नशाम्यति न संशयः।**





**पृष्ठोदयर्क्षे तच्छत्रे व्याधिमोक्षो न जायते॥२११॥**






 If the Moon or Rahu is in Udaya Lagna or in the 6th or 8th house, disease will occur due to poisoning or witchcraft but will not be cured. Even if the Moon sign in Udaya Lagna is in Prishthodaya Raasi, the illness will not be cured. 211











**व्याधिस्थानमिदं प्राहुर्मूर्ध्नि वक्त्रे भुजे करे।**





**वक्षसि स्तनयोः कुक्षौ कक्षे मूले च मेहने।  
ऊरौ पादौ च मेषाद्या राशयः परिकीर्तिताः॥२१२॥**











 In terms of the bodily organs, Aries is regarded as the head, Taurus the face, Gemini the arms, Cancer the hands, Leo the chest, Virgo the breasts, Libra the stomach, Scorpio the armpits, Sagittarius the arms, Capricorn the genitals, Aquarius the thighs, and Pisces the legs. In terms of the signs, the affected parts of the body can be predicted. 212











**कुजो मूर्ध्नि मुखे शुक्रः कण्ठे राहुर्भुजे वुधः। **





**चन्द्रो वक्षसि कुक्षौ च भानुर्नाभेरधो गुरुः। **





**ऊरौ शनिरहिः पादे ग्रहाणां स्थानमीरितम्॥२१३॥**  






 In terms of the planets, the bodily organs are distributed thus; Mars is the head, Venus the face, Rahu the neck, Mercury the arms, the Moon the chest, the Sun the stomach, Jupiter the lower portion below the navel, Saturn the thighs, and Ketu the feet. 213











**एतेष्वेव स्थलेषु स्यान्नष्टमेतेषु राशिषु।**





**पावयुक्तेषु दृष्टेषु नीचारिस्थेषु रुग्भवेद्॥२१४॥**











 If at the time of Prasna any sign is rising in the horizon, the lost property will be in the place assigned to that sign. Likewise, if malefics are posited in or aspecting or, if weak or inimical planets are in any sign, the corresponding parts of the body in terms of the sign and planet will be affected by disease. 214











**पश्यन्ति ये ग्रहाश्चन्द्रं व्याधिस्थानावलोकिनम्।**





**पूर्वोक्तमासवर्षाणि दिनानि च वदेद्बुधः॥२१५॥**






 The time taken for cure of the illness will be in terms of the days, months, and years of the planets (given in verses 84 and 85) aspecting the Moon which sees the oth house. 215











**षष्ठाष्टमे पापयुते रोगशान्तिर्न जायते।**





**षष्ठाष्टमे शुभयुते तदा व्याधिविमोचनम्॥२१६॥**











 If malefics are posited in the 6th and 8th houses from the Udaya Lagna, the disease will not be cured. But if, however, benefics are there, the disease will be cured. 216











**किञ्चिदत्र विशेषोऽस्ति रोगमृत्युस्थिते शुभाः।**





**यावद्भिर्दिवसैर्यन्ति तावद्भिर्व्याधिमोचनम्॥२१७॥**






 But there is one special feature to be noted. The time taken for cure of the illness will be the number of days taken by the benefics to transit the 6th and 8th houses. 217






**रोगस्थानाद्भवेऽस्ते वा पापखेटयुते तथा।**





**षष्ठाष्टमे चन्द्रयुते मरणं रोगिणां भवेत्॥२१८॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, malefics are in the 7th or 11th place from the 6th house (called the house of illness), or if the Moon is posited in the 6th or 8th house, death is certain. 218











**रोगस्थानं कुजः पश्येच्छिरस्तोदो ज्वरो भवेत्।**





**भृगुविषूचिस्सौम्यश्चेत् कक्षे ग्रन्थिर्भविष्यति॥२२०॥**











 If Mars aspects the house of illness (the 6th place), the person will have headache and fever. If Venus aspects it, he will get cholera; it Mercury aspects it, he will get boils in his armpits. 219











**रविश्चेदुदरव्याधिः शनिर्वातश्च पङ्गुता।**





**राहुर्विषं शशी पश्येन्नेत्ररोगो भविष्यति॥२२०॥**











 If the Sun aspects the house of illness (the 6th), the person will suffer from stomach–ache; If Saturn aspects it he will have wind–diseases or become lame; If Rahu aspects it, he will suffer from poisoning; and if the Moon aspects it,he will have eye–affliction. If Jupiter aspects it, he will have piles; and the effects of Venus will be like that of the Moon, say some. 220











**मूलव्याधिः गुरुः पश्येज्वन्द्रवत्स्याद् भृगुः परे।**





**परिघाविन्द्रकोदण्डदृष्टे प्रश्न ते सति।**





**कुष्ठव्याधिमिति ब्रूयाद्धूमे भूताहतं वदेत्। २२१॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, the Upagraha Indradhanus aspects or associates with the Parivesha ("another Upagraha), the person will be afflicted by leprosy. If Indradhanus associates with or aspects the Dhoomagraha (another subplanet), the person will be tormented by ghosts and devils. 221











**सर्वेऽपस्मारमादित्ये पिशाचपरिपीडनम्।  
काशं श्वासं च शूलं च शनौ शीतज्वरः कुजे॥२२२॥**











 If Indradhanus is associated with or aspects.any planet, the person will suffer from epilepsy; and if the Sun is aspected by or associated with Indradhanus, affliction by ghosts is to be predicted. If Saturn is afflicted by Indradhanus, either by association or aspect, the person will suffer from consumption; and Mars is similarly affected, the person will suffer from malaria. 222











**शुक्रे कोदण्डपरिधिदृष्टे प्रश्नेतु रोगिणाम्।**





**न व्याधिशमनं किञ्चिद्यदि नेक्षन्ति चेच्छुभाः।**





**रोगशान्तिर्भवेच्छीघ्रं मित्रस्वात्युच्च संस्थिताः॥२२३॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, Venus is aspected by the sub–planets Indradhanus and Praivesha and not by any benefic, there will be no cure of the disease. But if a benefic is in a friendly house, own house, or in very high exaltation, the disease will be cured very soon. 223











**शिरोललाटभ्रूनेत्रनासिकाश्रुतयोऽधरः।**





**चुबुकञ्चाङ्गुलिश्चैव कृत्तिकाद्या नवोडवः॥२२४॥**











 If at the time of the Prasna, anyone of the following nine stars is rising in the horizon – Krittikaa, Rohini, Mrigasira, Aardraa, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Aasleshaa, Makha and Pubba, the parts of the body afflicted will be respectively head, forehead, brow, eye, nose, ear, lower lip, chin, and finger. 224











**कण्ठवक्षःस्थलकुचोदरमध्यनितम्बकाः।  
शिश्रमण्डोऽधरः प्रोक्तश्चोत्तराद्या नवोडवः॥२२५॥**











 If the next nine stars are rising, namely, Uttaraa, Hasta, Chittaa, Swaatee, Visaakhaa, Anuraadhaa, Jyeshthaa, Moolaa and Poorvaashaadhaa, the afflicted parts arerespectively, neck, chest, breast, stomach, waist, buttocks, genital, the scrotum, and the upper lip. 225

**उदयर्क्षवशादेवं ज्ञात्वा तत्र गदं वदेत्।**





**अर्कनक्षत्रकं ज्ञात्वा नष्टद्रव्यं तथा वदेत्॥२२७॥**











 From the stars, the respective affected parts can be predicted as above. Finding the star near the Sun the lostarticle can also be predicted. 227






**त्रिकोणलग्नदशमे शुभश्चेद्व्याधयो नहि।**





**तेषु नीचारियुक्तेषु देहपीडा भविष्यति॥२२८॥**











 If a benefic occupies Trikona, Lagna or the 10th house, diseases will not afflict. If the planet is debilitated or inimical, disease will afflict. 228

**Chapter XII**






***ON DEATH***











**मरणस्य विधानानि ज्ञातव्यानि मनीषिभिः।**





**वृषस्य वृषभश्छत्रं सिह्मश्छत्रं हरेर्भवेत्॥२२९॥**






 Wise men can predict the time of death as in the following: 229











**अलिनो वृश्चिकश्छत्रं कुम्भश्छत्रङ्घटस्य च।**





**उच्चस्थानमिति ज्ञात्वाऽऽरूढे स्यादुदये यदि।**





**मरणं न भवेत्तस्य रोगिणो नात्र संशयः॥२३०॥**











 If the Aaroodha or Udaya Lagna synchronizes with the Chhatra Raasi, i.e. Scorpio for Scorpio, Leo for Leo, Taurus for Taurus, and Aquarius for Aquarius, and hence declared to be in exaltation, the person concerned about when the enquiry is made will not certainly die.






*Note*: In Prasna Saastra, if the same Raasi becomes Chhatra Raasi to itself, it is stated to be in exaltation. 230











**तुलाया कार्मुकं छत्रं नीचं मृत्युर्विपर्यये।  
मेषस्य मिथुनं छत्रं नीचं मृत्युर्विपर्यये॥२३१॥**











 If Libra happens to be Chhatra Raasi for Sagittarius (as either Aaroodha or Udaya) it is stated to be in debilitation, and the person's life will be in danger. One cannot be certain of death here, but if, however, Sagittarius happens to be Chhatra for Libra, death is certain. Likewise, if Gemini is the Chhatra Raasi for Aries, it is debilitated, the person will be in danger, but in the reverse case Aries being Chhatra for Gemini, death is certain. 231






**कन्या छत्रं कुलीरस्य नीचं मृत्युर्विपर्यये।**





**नक्रस्य मीनच्छत्रं च नीचं मृत्युर्विपर्यये।  
नीचे न शाम्यति व्याधिर्मृत्यो मरणमादिशेत्॥२३२॥**











 If Virgo is Chhatra for Cancer, it is in debilitation, and hence the person's life is in danger. But if Cancer is Chhatra Raasi for Virgo, death is certain. If Pisces is Chhatra for Capricom, it is in debilitation and hence life is endangered; but if Capricorn is Chhatra for Pisces, death is certain. The debilitated Raasi indicates danger to life and no cure of disease. But the Mrityudasaa foretells certain death. 232











**ग्रहेषु बलवान्सूर्यो यदि मृत्युस्तदाग्निना।**





**मन्दः क्षुधा जलेनेन्दुः शीतेन कविरुच्यते॥२३३॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, the Sun is strong, death by fire is likely; if Saturn is strong, death by hunger; if the Moon is strong, death by water; and if Venus is strong, death by freezing. 233






**बुघस्तुषारवाताभ्यां शस्त्रेणारो बली यदि।**





**राहुर्विषेण जीवस्तु कुक्षिरोगेण नश्यति॥२३४॥**











 And if Mercury is strong at the time of Prasna, death will take place by snow and storm; if Mars is strong, death by weapons; if Rahu is strong, death by poisoning; and if Jupiter is strong, death by some disease in the stomach is to be predicted. 234











**विधोः षष्टाष्टमे पापास्सप्तमे वा यदि स्थिताः।**





**रोगमृत्युस्थलाभ्यां वा रोगिणां मरणं ध्रुवम्॥२३५॥**











**आरूढं मरणस्थानं तस्मादष्टमगश्शशी।**





**पापाः पश्यन्तिचेन्मृत्युं रोगिणां कथयेत्सुधीः॥२३६॥**











 By finding the malefics in the 6th, 8th or 7th from the Moon at the time of Prasna, the nature of death of the diseased person is to be predicted. If, as stated above, the Aaroodha Lagna happens to be the house of death and from there in the 8th place is the Moon aspected by malefics, death to the diceased one is to be told by the wise. 235–236











**तृतीये भानुसंयुक्ते दशमे पापसंयुते।  
दशाहान्मरणं ब्रूयाच्छुक्रजीवौ तृतीयगौ।**





**सप्ताहान्मरणंब्रूयाद्रोगिणामतिबुद्धिमान्॥२३७॥**






 If the Sun is at the third place from the Udaya Lagna, or a malefic in the 10th place death in 10 days is likely. If Venus or Jupiter is in the 3rd place from Udaya Lagna, death to the diceased person in 7 days is to be predicted. 237











**उदये चतुरस्रे वा पापास्त्वष्टदिनान्मृतिः।**





**लग्नाद्वितीयगाः पापाश्र्चतुर्दशदिनान्मृतिः॥२३८॥**











 If malefics are in Udaya Raasi or in the 4th or 8th place, death in 8 days is likely. If malefic is in the 2nd place from Udaya Lagna death in 14 days is likely. 238











**त्रिदिनान्मरणं किन्तु दशमे पापसंयुते।**





**तस्मात्सप्तमगे पापे दशाहान्मरणं भवेत्।**





**निधनारूढगे पापे दृष्टे वा मरणं भवेत्।**





**तत्तद्ग्रहवशेनैव दिनमासादिनिर्णयः॥२३९॥**











 If a malefic is in the 10th place, death in 3 days is to be predicted. If a malefic is in the 7th place from Udaya Lagna, death in 10 days is likely. Along with this, one has to reckon the days and months given for various planets and give the prediction accordingly.  
* Note:* Some other text books affirm that if the bouse of death is a fixed sign, death will be in the native country; if it is a moveable sign, death will be in a foreign country; and if it is a common sign, death will be in the neighbouring country. 239

***ON HEAVENLY ABODE***











**ग्रहोच्चेस्वर्गमायाति रिपौ मृगकुले भवः।**





**नीचे नरकमायाति मित्रे मित्रकुले भवः।**





**स्वक्षेत्रे स्वजने जन्म मृतानां कथयेद्बुधः॥२४०॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, the Udaya Lagna is in exaltation, the dead man will attain the heavenly abode. If it is in an inimical sign the dead man will be reborn as an animal. If it is in debilitation he will go to hell. If it is a friendly house he will be reborn in a friend's house. If it is in its own house he will be reborn among his family or relatives. 240

***ONFOOD***  












**कथयामि विशेषेण भुक्तद्रव्यस्य निर्णयम्।**





**पाकभाण्डानि भुक्तानि व्यञ्जनानि रसास्ततः।**





**सह भौक्तन्भाजनानि तद्दातृस्नेहिनो रिपून्॥२४१॥**






 I will now tell you about the kind of food eaten–about the vessels in which the meal was prepared, the articles of food like vegetables, pulses, etc., their tastes, the guestswith whom the meal was taken, the plates on which food was served, the friends of the host and his enemies too – all in detail. 241











**मेषराशौ भवेच्छागं वृषभे गव्यमुच्यते।**





**धनुर्मिथुनसिह्मेषु मत्स्यमांसादिभोजनम्॥२४२॥**






 If at the time of Prasna, Aries is rising, the food taken is mutton; if Taurus, it is beef, is Gemini, Leo or Sagittarius is rising, it is fish. 242











**नक्रालिकर्कमीनेषु परिपक्वफलादिकम्।**





**तुलाकन्याघटेष्वेव शुद्धान्नमिति कीर्तयेत्॥२४३॥**






 If it is Cancer, Capricorn, Scorpio or Pisces, the food eaten is ripe fruit; and if it is Virgo, Libra or Aquarius, the meal is good rice. 243











**भानौ, तिक्तकदुक्षारमिश्रं भोजनमुच्यते।**





**कृष्णान्नं क्षौद्रसंयुक्तं भूमिपुत्रस्य भोजनम्॥ २४४॥**






 If at the time of Prasna the Sun is rising, the food has salty, hot and bitter taste; if it is Mars rising, the food is mixed with honey and black in colour. 244






**भर्जितान्युपदंशानि सौम्यस्याहुर्मनीषिणः।**





**पायसान्नं घृतयुतं गुरोर्भोजनमीरितम्॥२४५॥**






If it is Mercury rising, the food is well–spiced and servedwith pickles. 245






**सतैलकोद्रवान्न च भवेन्मन्दस्य भोजनम्।**





**चणकं राहुकेत्वोश्च रसवर्ग उहाहृतः॥२४६॥**






If it is Jupiter the food is served with ghee and sweets; if it is Saturn, the food is rye mixed oil; and if it is either Rahu or Ketu, the food is made of some grams. 246






**जीवस्य मषवटकं सूपमिश्रं तु भोजनम्।**





**चन्द्रस्य कन्दप्रसवमत्स्याद्यैर्भोजनं भवेत्।**





**क्षौद्रापूपपयोयुग्भिव्यंजनैर्भोजनं भृगोः॥२४७॥**






 From Jupiter rising one can predict cutlets (or vada) and dhall–mixed rice; from the Moon to be predicted tubers, flowers and fish; from Venus rising is to be understood that the food consists of sweet, milk–products etc. 247











**ओजराशौ शुभैर्दृष्टे सुरुच्या भोजनं भवेत्।**





**समराशौ मन्दरुच्या भुंक्तेऽल्पं पापवीक्षिते।**





**केचित्पश्यन्ति पापाश्चेत्पुराणान्नं क्षुघार्दितः॥२४८॥**











 If an odd sign is rising and aspected by benefics the food is tasty and refreshing; and if it is a common sign aspected by malefics, the food will be moderate and little. But some predict that if a common sign is aspected by amalefic, the food will be old and rotten and; taken on ahungry stomach. 248











**अर्कारौ मांसभोक्तारावुशनश्चन्द्रभोगिनः।  
नवनीतघृतक्षीरदधिभिर्भोजनं भवेत्॥२४९॥**











 Non–vegetarian food is predicted by the Sun and Marsrising; food with butter, milk, curd and ghee if it is Venus, the Moon or Rahu rising. 249











**जलराशिषु पापेषु ससौम्येष्वीक्षितेषु च।  
सतैलभोजनं ब्रूयादितिज्ञात्वा विचक्षणः॥२५०॥**






**पूर्वोक्तधातुवर्गेण थाजनानि विनिर्दिशेत्।  
मूलवर्गेण शाकादिनुपदंशान्वदेद्बुधः॥२५१॥**






**जीववर्गेण भोक्तंश्च मत्स्यमाषादिकानपि।**





**सर्वमालोक्य निश्चित्य प्रश्नान्नृणां वुघो वदेत्॥२५२॥**






 If a malefic is posited in a watery sign and (even if) associated with a benefic or aspected by it, articles of food fried in oil are to be predicted. A wise man by reckoning the nature of signs and planets with regard to food articles (mentioned in verses 243–247), should predict appropriately by noting the rising sign and planet at the time of Prasna. All considerations have to be taken into account before giving a prediction. 250–252

**स्वप्ने यान् परिपश्यन्ति सर्वान्वक्ष्यामि सर्वथा।**





**मेषोदये देवगृहं प्रासादाः संभवन्ति च।**





**वृषोदये दिनाधीशे ज्ञातगेहस्य दर्शनम्॥२५३॥**











 Whatever things and events are seen in dreams shall now be narrated. If the Udaya Raasi is Aries, one will dream of temples and storeyed houses. If the Raasi is Taurus but aspected by the Sun, the same kind of dream can be predicted. 253











**वृश्चिकस्योदयेऽर्कारौ व्याकुलं मृतदर्शनम्।**





**मिथुनस्योदये विप्रं तपस्विवचनानि च॥२५४॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, Scorpio is rising, with the Sun and Mars posited therein, the dream will be full of sadness, and he may dream about a dead man too. If Gemini is rising, he will dream of brahmins and ascetics teaching scriptures. 254











**कुलीरस्योदये क्षेत्रे सस्यं दृष्ट्वा पुनर्गृहम्।**

If the Sun and the Moon are in the 12th place, from the Prasna Lagna, both the eyes of the child will be blind. 325–326











**षष्ठे वा पंचमे पापाः पश्यन्तीन्दुदिवाकरौ।**





**मातापित्रोस्तु मरणं तयोर्मन्दः स्थितो यदि।**





**भ्रातृनाशं तथा भौमो मातुलस्य मृतिर्वदेत्॥३२७॥**











 If the Sun and the Moon posited in the 6th or 5th place are aspected by malefics, death of the parents is certain. If Saturn is in the 6th or 5th place, death of the brother, and if Mars is there in either of those places, death of the uncle is to be predfcted. 327











**उदयादित्रिकानां तु कण्टकेषु शुभा यदि।**





**मित्रस्वात्युच्चवर्गेषु सर्वारिष्टं विनश्यति॥३२८॥**











 If benefics are in the Kendras of Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra Lagnas or if benefics are in friendly, own or very exalted, or exalted Vargas all kinds of disaster or accidents will be prevented. 328  

**लग्नं च चन्द्रलग्नं च जीवो यदि न पश्यति।  
पापाः पश्यन्ति चेत्पुत्रो व्यभिचारेण जायते॥३२९॥**











 If Jupiter does not aspect the Prasna Lagna or the Moon, but only malefics are aspecting; the two Lagnas, the child is born to a different father. 329

***OF KNIVES***

















**छुरिकालक्षणं सम्यत्मवक्ष्यामि यथातथम्।**





**राहुणा संयुते चन्द्रे शस्त्रभङ्गो भविष्यति॥३३०॥**






 I am now going to tell you all about the ownership and fate of knives. If the Moon is associated with Rahu, the knife will break. If planets in debilitated or enemy's signs aspecting the Moon, the knife will also break. 330






**नीचारिस्थाः प्रपश्यन्ति यदि शस्त्रस्य भञ्जनम्।**





**शुभग्रहयुते चन्द्रे दृष्टे वास्ते शुभं भवेत्॥३३१॥**











 But if the Moon is associated with or aspected by benefics and is posited in the 7th place all good will come to the knife. 331











**पापग्रहसमेतेषु छत्रारूढोदयेषु च।**





**प्रष्टाप्रश्नाश्रितः किन्तु तदस्त्रेण हतो भवेत्॥३३२॥**











**अथवा कलहात्खड्गं परेणापहृतं भवेत्।**





**तेषु स्थानेषु सौम्येषु खड्गस्तु शुभदो भवेत्॥३३३॥**











 If at the time of Prasna, the Aaroodha, Udaya and Chhatra signs are associated with malefics, the person will be killed by the same knife; or the knife will be taken away by an enemy during a quarrel. But if in the above places benefics are posited, all good will come of the knife. 332–333











**प्रदर्शितस्य खड्गस्य लग्नेऽस्ते पापसंयुते।**





**खड्गस्यादौ व्रणं ब्रूयात्त्रिकोणे पापसंयुते॥३३४॥**











**शस्त्रभङ्गस्ततो व्योम्नि चतुर्थे पापसंयुते।**





**खड्गस्य भङ्गो मध्ये स्यादितिज्ञात्वा वदेत्सुधीः।**





**एकादशे तृतीये च पापे शस्त्राग्रभञ्जनम्॥३३५॥**











 At the time the knife is shown to the astrologist (this is called the Khadga Lagna) if a malefic is posited in the 7th place from that Lagna, the knife will be broken at its lower portion. If malefics are in the 5th or 9th place, the whole knife will be broken at its lower portion. If malefics are in the 10th and 4th, places, the middle portion of the knife will be broken. If in the 11th or 3rd place, the pointed edge of the knife will be broken. 334–335  






**मित्रस्वात्युच्चनीचारिवर्गानधिगता ग्रहाः।  
तत्तद्वर्गस्थलायत्तं शस्त्रमित्यमिधीयते॥३३६॥**











 If plancts in a friendly house aspect the Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra Raasis, the knife belongs to a friend; if planets in their own houses aspect the above Raasis the knife belongs to the enquirer himself making the Prasna; if planets in exaltationaspect the above Raasis, the knife belongs to one higher than himself; if planets in debilitation aspect the Raasis, the knife belongs to one higher than himself; and if planets posited in inimical houses aspect the above Raasis (Udaya, Aaroodha and Chhatra), the knife belongs to his enemy. 336











**सन्मुखो यदि खेटस्स्यात्तदीयं खड्गमुच्यते।**





**तिर्यङमुखश्चेत्तच्छस्त्रमन्यदीयमितीरयेत्॥३३७॥**











**अधोमुखश्चेत्सङग्रामे च्युतमाहृतमुच्यते।**





**तत्तच्चेष्टानुरूपेण स्वान्याहरणविस्मृतिः॥३३८॥**











 If forward–looking planets (the Moon and Jupiter,) aspect the Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra Raasis, the knife belongs to the owner (i.e. the person making the Prasna,). If the obliquely looking planet (Mars) aspects the above Raasis, the knife belongs to another; and if the downward–looking planets (Venus and Mercury) aspect the above Raasis, the knife has been obtained after defeating the foe, and the knife has fallen down and been picked up by the present owner. By taking into consideration the various characteristics of the planets, the ownership or misplacement of the knife is to be determined.  
 Note: This is explained in verses 40 and 50 earlier. 337–338

**Chapter XXII**






***OF SHADOWS AND SHAFTS***

















**शल्यप्रश्ने तु तत्काले पादभा वसुनेत्रयुक्।**





**अभ्यस्ता नृपसङ्ख्याभि शेषाणां फलमुच्यते॥३३९॥**











 To answer some queries, the shadow of the person making the query is measured; and based, on its length certain calculations are made and predictions given. Measure the shadow, leaving the foot, by your pace, add 28, multiply by 12. and divide the sum by 16. The prediction is given on the basis of the quotient arrived at. This is called the Science of Salya. 339











**कपालास्थीष्टकालोष्टकाष्ठदेवविभूतयः।**





**शावाङ्गारकधान्यानि धनपाषाणदर्दुराः।**





**गोस्थिश्वास्थिपिशाचाश्च ऋमाच्छत्यानि षोडश॥॥ ३४०॥**











*Salya is of 16 kinds. They are:*






(1) the skull (2) bone ( 3 ) brick ( 4 ) tile (5) firewood (6) god's idol (7) ash ( 8 ) corpse (9) charcocal (10) ghost (11) wealth (in terms of silver and gold ) ( 12 ) granite (13) toad (14) cow's bone ( 15 ) dog's bone, and (16) ghost. 340











**एषु शल्येषु मण्ङूकस्वर्णगोस्थि च धान्यकम्।**





**दृष्ट चेदुत्तमं चान्ये सर्वे स्युरशुभावहाः॥३४१॥**  

 Of these, if (10) (11) (13) and (14) come' together (i.e. grain, toad and cow's bone); it is reckoned as excellent (Uttama) since the 'Salya' grain is there. But other 'Salyas' are reckoned as bad, malefic.






 An example is given here: The 'Salya' is determined by the quotient arrived at after the calculation given inverse 339. Let us take the length of the shadow as 16 paces. By adding 28, the sum is 44. Multiplied by 12, the product is 528. Divided by 16, the quotient is 33, remainder 0. Instead of 0 the remainder is taken as 16 as there are 16 'Salyas'. The 16th 'Salya' is 'ghost' ––which is bad or malefic. Let us take another example by measuring this shadow; we assume it is 13 paces. By the above calculation we get the final remainder 12. The 12th Salya is 'granite' which again is bad. By such calculations, if we arrive at the remainders, (10) (11) (13) or (14) i.e. 'grain', wealth, load or cows's bone, they are considered as being very good. 341











**अहिचक्रं प्रवक्ष्यामि यथासर्वज्ञभाषितम्।  
द्रव्यं शल्यं तथाशून्यं येन जानाति साधकः॥ ३४२॥**











What the wise men have stated as 'Ahi Chakra" I shall describe now. By this means, the student can learn about wealth, 'Salya' and 'Suunya' (i.e. Zero). 342











**ऊर्ध्वं रेखाष्टकं लेख्यं तिर्यक्पञ्च तथैव च।**





**अहिचक्रं भवेदेवमष्टाविंशतिकोष्ठकम्॥३४३॥**











 The 'Ahi Chakra' is drawn thus by 8 lines vertically and 5 lines horizontally making 28 houses. 343











**अष्टाविंशतिकोष्ठेषु वहिधिष्ण्यादिकं न्यसेत्।**





**यत्र भे तिष्ठति शशी तत्र शाल्यमुदाहृतम्॥३४४॥**











 These 28 houses have to be filled with the stars starting from Krittikaa. Wherever the Moon is found in these houses, it is to be noted there is 'Salya'. 344  

**उदयर्क्षादिकं न्यस्येदष्टाविंशतिकोष्ठके।  
गणयच्चन्द्रनक्षत्रं तत्र शल्यं प्रकीर्तितम्॥३४५॥**











 Taking the star rising in the horizon at the time of Prasna as the first, fill up the 28 houses with stars and counting the number up to the star where the Moon is, note the 'Salya' indicated by that number. 345






**निधेर्निवर्तनैकस्थस्संभ्रान्तो यत्र भूतले।  
तत्र चक्रमिदं स्थाप्यं स्थानद्वारमुखस्थितम्॥३४६॥**











He, who is anxious to find treasure and is searching, should make the ‘Ahi Chakra' at that place of his search. 346











**![](../books_images/1681907468.png)**





**तत्र पौष्णाश्वियाम्यर्क्षंकृत्तिकापितृभाग्यकम्।**





**उत्तराफल्गुनी लेख्यं पूर्वपङत्तयां भसप्तकम्॥३४७॥**











 Let him fill up the eastern 7 houses with the following stars (as shown in the figure above):






 (1) Revatee (2) Aswinee (3) Bharanee (4) Krittikaa (5) Makha (6) Pubbaa (7) Uttaraa. 347











**अहिर्बुध्न्यादिपादर्क्षंशतभं ब्रह्मसार्पभम्।  
पुष्यहस्तं समालेख्यं द्वितीयां पङ्क्तिमास्थितम्॥३४८॥**











 In the next seven, let him fill up the stars:





 (1) Uttarabhadraa (2) Poorvabhadraa (3) Satabhisha (4) Rohinee (5) Aasleshaa (6) Poorvaashaadhaa and (7) Hasta. 348











**विधि विष्णु धनिष्ठाख्यं सौम्यं रौद्र पुनर्वसू।**





**चित्राभान् च तृतीयायं पङ्कौ धिष्ण्यस्य सप्तकं॥३५९॥**











 In the third seven, let him fill up the following stars:





 (1) Abhijit (2) Sravana ( 3 ) Dhanishtha ( 4 ) Mrigasiraa (5) Aardraa (6) Punarvasu and (7) Chitta. 349











**विश्वर्क्षं तोयभं मूलं ज्येष्ठामैत्रविशाखके।  
स्वाती पङ्क्तौ चतुर्थ्यां तु कृत्वा चक्रं विलेखयेत्॥ ३५०॥**











 In the last line, the following stars are to be filled up:  
 (1) Uttaraashaadhaa ( 2 ) Poorvaashaadha (3) Moolaa (4) Jyeshthaa (5) Anuraadhaa ( 6 ) Visaakhaa and (7) Swaatee 350











**एवं प्रजायते चक्रे प्रस्तारा पन्नगाकृतिः**





**द्वारशाखे मखायाम्ये द्वारस्था कृत्तिका मता॥३५१॥**











 Thus is formed the Ahi Chakra. Opposite the stars Bharanee and Makha rise two branches and in between is the hole opposite Krittikaa. In the Ahi Chakra the Moon is posited in 14 houses and the rest belongs to the Sun. 351











**अश्वीशपूर्वाषाढादित्रिकं पञ्च चतुष्टयम्।  
रेवतीपूर्वाभार्द्वेन्दोर्भान्यन्यानितु भास्वतः॥३५२॥**











 As indicated in the figure, three stars from Aswinee, 5 stars from Aardraa, 4 stars from Poorvabhadraa and Revatee belong to the Moon i.e. Stars belonging to the Moon are: Aswince, Bharanee, Krittikaa, Aardraa, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Aasleshaa, Makha, Poorvabhadraa, Uttaraashaadhaa, Sravana, Dhanishthaa, Revatee and Poorvabhadraa. Stars belonging to the Sun are the remaining 14; Rohince, Mrigasiraa. Pubbaa, Uttara, Hasta, Chitta, Swaatee, Visaskhaa, Anuraadhaa, Jyeshthaa, Abhijit, Moolaa, Satabhisha and Uttarabhadraa. 352











**उदयादिगता नाड्यो भग्नाः षष्ट्याप्तशेषके।**





**दिनेन्दुभुक्तयुक्तोसौ भवेत्तत्कालचन्द्रमाः॥३५३॥**











 Find out the star where the Moon is at the time of Prasna and the time already gone in that star in terms of 'Naazhigai' (i.e. 24 minutes), multiply it by 25, and divide the product by 60. Leaving the quotient, the remainder is to be counted from the star where the Moon is, and the resulting star is called the 'dinentai". 353











**षष्टिघ्नं तं निशानाथं शरवेदाप्तकं पुनः।**





**युगैश्शेषं भवेद्यत्तत्प्रागादिचक्रवर्गगम्।  
चन्द्रवत्साधयेत्सूर्यमृक्षस्थं चेष्टकालिकम्॥३५४॥**






 Again taking the 'Naazhigai' already gone in that star by the Moon, multiply by 60 and divide by 45. The quotient is again to be divided by 4. The remainder indicates the direction in which the Moon will be station at the time of Prasna, taking East as 1, South as 2, West as 3 and North as 4.






 Example: Let us take the Moon is in Mrigasiraa; it has already spent 52 Naazhigais there. Multiplying 52 by 27, the product is 1404, which divided by 60 gives the remainder 24. Counting 24 stars from Mrigasira, we get Aswinee. The Aswinee star is called dinendu. Again multiplying 52 (time already spent) by 60 and dividing it by 45, we get the remainder 1; it means, the Moon is in the East. Likewise the calculation is to be made for the Sun. 354











**पश्चाद्विलोकयेत्तौ च स्वर्क्षेवाचान्यभे स्थितौ।  
चन्द्रऋक्षे यदार्केन्दु निधिस्तत्र न संशयः।**





**भानुऋक्षे स्थितौ तौ चेत्तदा शल्यं च नान्यथा॥३५५॥**











 Having made the tabular statement as described in the above calculation, one has to find whether the Sun and the Moon are in their own cubicles or in each other's interchanged. If both the Sun and the Moon are in the Moon's cubicle, the person well get a treasure in that place. If both the Sun and the Moon are in the Sun's cubicle, the same Salya will be noted. If, however, it is otherwise, it means that there is no Salya in that place. 355











**स्वस्वभद्वितयं ज्ञेयं नास्ति किञ्चिद्विपर्यये।**





**स्थितं न लभते द्रव्यं चन्द्रं क्रूरग्रहान्विते॥३५६॥**











 If either the Sun or the Moon is in its own cubicle or both in their own cubicles, the Salya regarding treasure is to be calculated. If it is otherwise, it means there is no Salya. Even if the Moon is in its own house, but aspected by a malefic, the person will not get the treasure inspite of the fact of his having that desirable ‘Salya'. 356











**पुष्टे चन्द्रे भवेन्मुद्रा क्षीणे चन्द्रेऽल्पको निधिः।**





**ग्रहदृष्टिवशात्सोऽपि विज्ञेयो नवधा वुधैः॥३५७॥**











 If it is a full Moon, the treasure will have a mudraa, (by this term, some infer that the treasure will be a large one), and if it is a partial Moon, the treasure will be meagre, if the Moon is aspected by the planet, the native of the treasure will be of 9 kinds 357











**हेम तारं च ताम्रारं रत्नं कांस्यायसं त्रपु।**





**नागं चन्द्रे विजानीयाद्भास्करादिग्रहेक्षिते॥३५८॥**











 If the Moon arrived at by calculation, is aspected by the Sun, the treasure will be gold. But this Moon is aspected by the Moon at the time of Prasna, the treasure will be silver or pearl; if the Moon is aspected by Mars, the treasure will be copper; if aspected by Mercury, it will be brass; if by Jupiter, the treasure will be gems; if by Venus, it will be bronze; if by Saturn it will be iron; if by Rahu it will be lead; and if by Ketu it will be tin. 358











**मिश्रैमिंश्रं भवेद्द्रव्यं शून्यं दृष्टिविपर्यये।**





**सर्वग्रहेक्षिते चन्द्रे निर्दिष्टोऽसौ महानिधिः॥३५९॥**











 If the Moon is aspected by two or more planets, the treasure also will be of a mixed character. If no planet aspects the Moon, the treasure too will be nothing. But if all plane aspect the Moon, the treasure will be a very large one. 359











**शुभक्षेत्रगते चन्द्रे लाभस्स्यान्नात्र संशयः।**





**पापक्षेत्रे न लाभोहि विज्ञेयः खगपारगैः॥३६०॥**











 If the Moon is in beneficial sign, there will be gain of treasure. But if it is in a malefic sign, there will be no gain, say those experts in this Science of Salya. 360  

**हेम तारं च ताम्ररं पाषाणां मृण्मयायसम्।**





**सूर्यादिगृहगे चन्द्रे द्रव्यभाण्डं प्रजायते॥३६१॥**











 If the Moon is in the Sun's house the treasure will be in a golden vessel; if the Moon is in its own sign, the vessel will be of silver or pearl; if in Mars' house it will be a copper vessel; if in Mercury's sign, the vessel will be of bronze; if in Jupiter's sign it will be stone vessel; if in Venus's sign, it will be a mudpot; if in Saturn's house it will be an iron vessel. 361











**भुक्तराश्यंशमानेन भूमानं कोविदैः करैः।  
नीचे विघ्नं परं नीचे जलस्थोऽसौ भवेन्निधिः॥ ३६२॥**











 The size of the plot of ground where the treasure is found can be determined by the 'amsas' (strength) in the Moon's sign or by the strength of rays in the planets in that sign. If the Moon is in a debilitated amsa, the treasure will be under water. 362











**स्वोचस्थ ऊध्वेगं द्रव्यं नवांशक क्रमेण च।**





**परमोच्चे परे तुङ्गे भित्तिस्थं त्वृक्षसंक्रमे॥३६३॥**











 If the Moon is in its own exaltation sign, or in exalted amsa the treasure will be found easily in the upper layer. If the Moon is in its highest exaltation, the treasure will be in still higher layers; and if the Moon is in the junction of the signs, the treasure will be inside a wall. 363











**चन्दांशभुक्तमानेन द्रव्यसङ्ख्या विधीयते।  
तस्या दशगुणा वृद्धिः षड्वर्गेन्दुबलक्रमात्॥३६४॥**











 The 16 kinds of Salyas are determined according to the strength of the cubicle in which the Moon dwells. The Shadvargas of the Moon give added strength and the number obtained by ordinary reckoning is increased tenfold. 364






**ग्रहो सुखं ग्रहश्चैव क्षेत्रपालञ्च मातृकाः।**





**र्दापेशं भीषणं रुद्रं पक्षं नागं विदुः क्रमात्॥३६५॥**











 Of this tenfold increase, the first increase is related to the planet concerned; the 2nd to the face; the 3rd to the planet; the 4th to the guardian of the field (Kshetrapaala); the 5th to the divine mothers; the 6th to the bright luminous gods; the 7th to the terrifying gods; the 8th to Rudra; the 9th to Yaksha; and the 10th to the Naagas. 365











**यहे होमः प्रकर्तव्यो सुखे नारायणो बलिः।**





**क्षेत्रपाले सुरां मांसं मातृकायां महाबलिः॥३६६॥**











 For the 1st increase, a ‘homa' sacrifice is to be done; for the 2nd increase, the Naaraayana sacrifice is to be performed; in the 3rd, an ordinary sacrifice is to be done; in the 4th increase, meat and wine are to be offered; in the Sth increase, a big sacrifice must be made. 366 
                            
**दीपेशे दीपजा पूजा भीषणे भीषणार्चनम्।  
रुद्रे च रुद्रजो जाप्यो यक्षे यक्षादिशान्तयः॥ ३६७॥**











 In the 6th increase regarding luminous gods the worship of lights is to be performed; in the 7th the worship of the frightful gods is to be done; in the 8th, one has to recite the mantras of Rudra; in the 9th the Yakshas have to be appeased by appropriate measures. 367











**नागे नागग्रहाः पूज्या गणनाथेन संयुताः।**





**लक्ष्मीधरदितत्वानि सर्वकार्येषु पूजयेत्॥३६८॥**











 In the 10th increase, worship to the serpentgods associated with the lord of the elementals (Gananaatha) is to be preformed. In every kind of worship, prayer to wealth–giving elementals is also to be offered. 368











**एवं कृते विधाने हि निरसाध्योपि सिद्ध्यति॥**





**निधिप्राप्त्या नरा लोके वन्दनीया न संशयः॥३६९॥**











 By doing such rituals, even the impossible kinds of work can be accomplished. Undoubtedly people respect those who have obtained treasure. 369











**शङ्कास्थलस्य विस्तारायामावन्योन्यताडितौ।**





**विंशत्यापहृतं शेषमरत्निरिति कीर्तितम्॥३७०॥**











**रनिं गुणित्वा नवभि र्निरिसन्तानमुच्यते।**





**तत्प्रदेशं गुणित्वाङ्कै र्हृत्वा विंशतिभिर्यदि॥३७१॥**






**शिष्टं अंगुलं एवोक्तं रत्नि प्रादेशं अंगुलं।**





**एवं क्रमेण रत्न्याद्यं अगाधं कथयेदघः॥३७२॥**






* Sishtam Angulam Eyvouktam*





* Ratni Praadesam Angulam  
 Eyvam Krameyna Ratnyaadyam  
 Agaagham Kathayeydagha :\।*






 The length and breadth of the reckoned place must first be determined. By multiplying one by the other and dividing the product by 20, the quotient obtained is called Aratni. The remainder is to be multiplied by nine and the product is called Nirisantaanam. Multiplying this again by nine and dividing it by 20, the quotient is to be left out, and the remainder is to be taken as Angula. This is called Ratnipraadesamangulam. This is the method by which the exact place of the treasure inside the earth in terms of Aratni and Angula is determined. 370–372






**केन्द्रेषु पापयुक्तेषु पृष्टं शल्य न दृश्यते।**





**शुभग्रहयुतेष्वेषु शल्यं तत्र प्रजायते।  
पापसौम्ययुते केन्द्रे शल्यमस्तीति निर्दिशेत्॥३७३॥**






 If malefics are in the Kendras, the ascertained Salya cannot be found out. But if benefics are posited in the Kendras, the Salya will be found there. But if both benefics and malefics are in the Kendras, one can only predict that the Salya is there. 373






**रविः पश्यति चेद्देवं कुजश्चेब्दह्मराक्षसम्।**





**केन्द्रे चन्द्रारसहिते कुजनक्षत्रकोष्ठके॥३७४॥**






**पिपीलिकाघः केन्द्रे तु जीवचन्द्रसमन्विते।**





**जीवस्थेडुगते कोठे स्वर्णं गोपुरुषास्थिनी॥३७५॥**











 If the Sun aspects a Kendra prediction is about gods; if Mars aspects the Kendra one that to refer to Brahmarakshasas (devils). If both Mars and the Moon are in a Kendra, and it happens to be the trough of a star belonging to Mars, one can find in the earth, only an ant–hill. If Jupiter and the Moon are in a Kendra and it happens to be a trough of a star belonging to Jupiter one can find in the earth either gold or the bones of a cow or man. 374–375  

**उदयारूढकेन्द्रेषु स्वर्भानुर्यदि तिष्ठति।  
राहुस्थर्क्षगते कोष्ठे वल्मीकमुपदीपयुक्॥३७६॥**






 If Rahu is in Udaya or Aaroodha Kendra and it happens to be the trough of a star belonging to Rahu, one has to predict the unearthing of an ant–hill with light nearby. 376






**शुभान् केन्द्रे युतान् पापाः पश्यन्ति बलिनो यदि।**





**तत्क्षेत्रे विद्यते शल्यमेषु पापाः यदि स्थिताः॥३७७॥**






 If benefic planets in a Kendra are aspected by strong malefics, one can predict a Salya (bone) in that place. 377






**देवयक्षपिशाचाद्यास्तत्र तिष्ठन्त्यसंशयम्।**





**ग्रहांशुसङ्ख्यया तेषां खातमानं वदेत्सुधीः॥३७८॥**






 If malefics are in Kendras, there is no doubt that in that place there will be ghosts, Yakshas or gods. In accordance with the number of rays of the planets will be these ghosts or gods down deep in the earth. 378






**चन्द्रे बुधेन संयुक्ते वुधनक्षत्रकोष्ठगे।**





**स्वशल्यं विद्यते तत्र केन्द्रे शुकेन्दुसंयुते॥३७९॥  

शुक्रस्थितर्क्षगे कोष्ठे रौप्यं श्वेतशिलापिवा।  
पञ्चषडसुभूतानि सपादैकं तथैव च॥३८०॥  

सार्धरूपाक्षिरवयः सूर्यादीनां करास्स्मृताः।**





**शल्यागाधमनेनैव करेण कथयेत्सुधीः॥३८१॥**  

 If Mars and Mercury are in the trough of a star belonging to Mercury there will be found a 'Salya' associated with Mercury. If Venus and the Moon are in a Kendra which is the trough of a star belonging to Venus, there will be found silver or white stone. The Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are respectively having 5,6,8, 5, 1¼, 1¼, 1½, 2 and 12 rays. In terms of these rays, one has to dig deep in the earth to find the Salya. 379–381

 Now I will tell you calculations about digging wells. Draw five lines across and 8 vertically (as stated in verse 346) forming 38 troughs or cubicles.The stars have to be filled up taking that particular star at the time of Prasna as the first. If it is morning, the cubicles have to face East first; if the Prasna is made at noontime, the cubicles of the South are to face forward; if the Prasna is made in the evening, the cubicles have to face West first; if it is made after mid–night, the cubicles have to face North first as in the following diagrams: 382–386






**मध्याह्ने पैत्रमारभ्य मैत्रमाद्यं निशामुखे।**





**अर्धरात्रेधनिष्ठाद्यं पूर्ववद्गणयेत्क्रमात्॥३८७॥**






**आग्रेय्यां दिशि नैर्ऋत्यां वायव्यां कोष्ठकद्वयम्।**





**त्यक्त्वा प्रत्येकमेवं हि तृतीयाद्यं विलोकयेत्॥३८८॥**






 If the Prasna is made at noon, leave out two troughs (cubicles) in the south–east and from the third beginning with Makha star fill up the rest as in the earlier table. If the Prasna is made in the evening, leave out two troughs (cubicles) in the south–west and from the third beginning with Anuraadha, fill up the rest with stars as in the earlier table. If the Prasna is made in the midnight, leave out the first two troughs (cubicles) in the north–east and from the third commencing with dhanishthaa, fill up the rest with stars as earlier. 387–388






**दिनार्धं सप्तभिर्हृत्वा यल्लब्धं नाडिकादिकम्।**





**ज्ञात्वा तत्तत्प्रमाणेन कृत्तिकादीनि विन्यसेत्।**





**यन्नक्षत्रं तदा सिद्धं प्रश्रकाले विशेषतः॥३८९॥**






 The length of half a day is to be divided among 7 stars commencing from Krittikaa and they have to be filled up in the cubicles as in Table 1: e.g., If a day is taken as 29 Naazhigais (24 minutes make one Naazhigai); half a day comes to 14%, and if this is divided by 7 we get for each star 2 Vs Naazhigais Which means 51 minutes. For the first 51 minutes from 6 a.m. if the Prasna is made, we. have to take the star as Krittikaa. Likewise we have to know which of the 7 stars is reigning at the time of Prasna, between 6 a.m. to 12 Noon. 389






**कृत्तिकास्थानमारभ्य पूर्ववद्गणयेत्सुधीः।**





**यत्कोष्ठे चन्द्रनक्षत्रं तत्रोदयक्रमाल्लिखेत्।**





**तदादीनि क्रमेणैव पूर्ववद्गुणयेत्सुधीः॥३९०॥**






 In a similar manner, from 12 Noon to 6 p.m., the 7 stars from Makha to Visaakhaa are ruling, each for 51 minutes.  
 From 6 p.m. to 12 midnight, the 7 stars Anuraadhaa to Dhanishthaa are ruling, each for 51 minutes; and one has to find out which star is to be considered at the time of Prasna.; From midnight to 6 in the moming, the 7 stars from Satabhisha to Bharanee are to be taken, and calculations accordingly made.  
 Further at the time of Prasna, one has to determine the star of the day according to the almanac, and fix it up in the cubicle, starting from Anuraadhaa if it is night from 6 to 12,and from Dhanishthaa if it is morning from 12 midnight to 6 a.m. That cubicle is called the house of the Moon's star. 389–390  

**यत्रेन्दुदृश्यते तत्र समृद्धमुदकं भवेत्।**





**शुक्रनक्षत्रकोष्ठे वा जलमस्तीत्युदाहरेत्॥३९१॥  

जीवनक्षत्रकोष्ठेतु तत्र स्वर्णमुदीरयेत्।  
तुलोक्षकर्ककुंभालिमीननक्राश्च राशयः॥३९२॥**






**जलरूपा स्तदुदये जलमस्तीति निर्दिशेत्।**





**तत्रस्थौ चन्द्रशुक्रौ चेदस्ति तत्र बहूदकम्॥३९३॥**






 Having constructed this, where the Moon is situated (namely the house of the Moon's star), it has to be noted that it is a watery place. If the cubicle happens to have a star associated with Venus, one has to predict that the place is watery. If the star happens to be associated with Jupiter, one can predict the finding of gold there.  
 The signs of Libra, Taurus, Cancer, Aquarius, Scorpio and Capricorn are stated to be watery signs. If the star happens to rise in any one of these watery signs, prediction about water being available (for digging wells) in that place should be made. If, in that place, the Moon and Venus are posited, prediction about a great volume of water can be made. 391–393






**बुधजीवोदये तत्र किञ्चिज्जलमुदीरयेत्।**





**एतान् राशीन् प्रपश्यन्ति यदि शन्यर्क भूमिजाः।**





**जलं न विद्यते तत्र फणिदृष्टे बहूदकम्॥३९४॥**











 If that rising sign belongs to the Mercury group, a little water can be predicted. But if Saturn or Sun aspects the above signs, there will be no water. If Rahu aspects them, there willbe water. 394  

**अधस्तादुदयारूढात्तच्छत्रेतूपरि स्थिते।**





**जलग्रहयुते दृष्टे चाधश्चेत्स्यादधोजलम्।**





**ऊर्ध्वदृष्टिर्ग्रहो राशावूर्ध्वमेवोदकं भवेत्॥३९५॥**











 If the Chhatra Raasi is above the Udaya and Aaroodha Raasis, and is aspected by a watery plane or associated with it, water will be found at a deep level. But if an upward–looking planet is in that Raasi, the water can be found at a higher level.  
 Note: The planets in the six signs commencing from that where the Sun is posited are called upward–looking planets. The planets after the six signs (i.e. from the 7th to the 12th) are called downward–looking planets. 395











**ऊर्ध्वाधः स्थलयोः पापास्तिष्ठन्ति यदि नोदकम्।**





**अधो जलं चतुस्स्थानादस्तान्नद्यागमो भवेत्॥३९६॥**  

 If malefics are found either above or below the Udaya Aaroodha and Chhatra Raasis, there will be no water in that place. But if a malefic is in the 4th place from Udaya or Aaroodha signs, water will be found at a deep level. 396











**दशमे नवमे वर्षे केचिदाहुर्मनीषिणः।**





**जलाजलग्रहवशाज्जलनिर्णयमीरयेत्॥३९७॥**











 Some astrologists predict that a river will flow in that place after 7 or 10 years. The availability of water is to be determined by finding out watery or non–watery planets in the place. 397











**केन्द्रषु तिष्ठतश्चन्द्रजीवौ यदि शुभोदकम्।**





**चन्द्रे शुक्रयुते केन्द्रे पर्वतेऽपि जलं वदेत्॥३९८॥**











 If the Moon or Jupiter is posited in a Kendra, good potable water is available there. If Venus and the Moon are in a Kendra, water will be in plenty even if it happens to be a mountainous place. 398











**चन्द्रसौम्ययुते केन्द्रे जीर्णञ्च लवणोदकम्।**





**आरूढात् केन्द्रगे चन्द्रे परिध्याद्यभिवीक्षिते॥३९९॥**






 If the Moon and Mercury are in a Kendra, old salt water will be available in that place. If the Moon is in a Kendra to the Aaroodha Lagna and is aspected by Parivesha or other Upagrahas, water will be at a deep level. 399











**अधो जलं ततोगाधं पूर्वोक्तग्रहरश्मिभिः।**





**शुक्रेण सौम्यो युक्तश्चेत्कषायं जलमादिशेत्॥४००॥**











 The depth in which water will be available is determined by counting the rays of the respective planets detailed above. If Mercury and Venus are associated and posited in a Kendra the water will be brackish. 400











**कन्यामिथुनभे सौम्ये जलं स्यादन्तरालगम्।**





**वृहस्पतौ राहुयुते पाषाणो जायतेऽन्तरा॥४०१॥**











 Water will be at a middle level (neither too high nor too low), if Mercury is in its own signs of Gemini or Virgo. If Jupiter is associated with Rahu, granite stones will be in the middle level. 401











**शुक्रचन्द्रयुते राहावगाधे जलमेधते।**





**भास्करे क्षारसलिलं परिवेषे धनुर्यदि।  
राहुणा संयुते मन्दे जलं स्यादन्तरालगम्॥४०२॥**











 If Rahu is associated with Venus and the Moon, there will be gush of water at a deep level. If the Sun or Parivesha is there in Sagittarius, the water will be salty in taste. If Saturn is associated with Rahu, water will be available at a middle level. 402






**अर्कस्योषरभूमिस्स्यात्पापाद्वा कंटकस्थली।**





**नारिकेलादिपुन्नागपूगयुक्ता क्षमा गुरोः॥४०३॥**






**शुक्रस्य कदली वल्ली बुधस्य पनसो भवेत्।**





**वल्मीकं राहुकेत्वोश्च त्वितिज्ञात्वा वदेद्बुधः॥४०४॥**






 The kind of soil a place would be, where one wants to dig a well is determined thus. If the Sun is there, the soil would be barren with saline content; the malefics–Saturn and Mars–indicate a soil where only thorns and brambles can grow. Jupiter indicates coconut, dates and arecanut groves; Venus indicates plantain and creeper–growing expanse; Mercury points to jack–fruit–growing soil; Rahu and Ketu indicate anthills. 403–404

**स्वामिदृष्टियुते वापि स्वक्षेत्रमिति कीर्तयेत्।**





**अन्यैर्युक्तेऽथवा दृष्टे परकीयस्थलं वदेत्॥४०५॥**






 If Saturn or Rahu is posited in Udaya Lagna at the place where one wants to dig a well, one can only meet with termites, snakes and other insects. If the rising Lagna sign is aspected by the lord of the Lagna, the place where the well is being dug is owned by the person; but if it is either aspected by or associated with other planets, the place belongs to another. 405

**Chapter XXIV**






***OF ARMIES***











**सैन्यस्यागमनं वक्ष्ये शत्रोरागमनं तथा।**





**चरोदये चरारूढे पापाः पंचमगा यदि॥४०६॥**











 Now I will describe the arrival of armies and the entry of the enemy into the country. He who knows the Prasna Saastra must predict about the arrival of armies, if the Udaya Raasi and the Aaroodha Raasi happen to be in a moveable sign and malefics are in the 5th house. 406











**सेनागमनमस्तीति कथयेच्छास्त्रवित्तमः।  
चतुष्पादुदयेजाते युग्मराश्युदये तथा॥४०७॥**











 If the Udaya Raasi happens to be in a quadruped or biped sign and the lord of the Lagna is in retrograde motion; the army will return to its country. 407











**लग्नस्याधिपतौ वक्रे सेना पथि निवर्तते।**





**शत्रोरागमनं नास्ति चतुर्थे पापसंयुते॥४०८॥**






 The enemy will not invade the country, if a malefic is positedin the 4th house. 408











**उदयारूढछत्रेषु केन्द्रेषु भुजगो यदि।**





**दूरस्थिता च नायाति सेना पथि निवर्तते॥४०९॥**






 If Rahu happens to be in Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra Raasi, or in Kendra, the army will be far away. It will not enter the town. It will return home, while it is half way. 409











**आरूढे ह्युदिताः कुंभकुलीरालिझषा यदि।**





**चतुर्थकेन्द्रे बलिनो यदि सेना निवर्तते॥४१०॥**











 If the Aaroodha Raasi happens to be in any one of the signs Aquarius, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, and if in there 4th place (Kendra) there is a strong planet, the enemy's forces will retreat and return home. 410











**चरोदये चरारूढे भौमार्कगुरवस्तदा।  
तिष्ठन्ति यदि पश्यन्ति सेना याति महत्तरा॥४११॥**











 If the Udaya Raasi rises in a moveable sign, and happens to be also the Aaroodha Raasi, and if Mars, the Sun or Jupiter is posited there, or aspects the Raasis, prediction about the arrival of a big army should be made.  
* Note* : The oncoming army is called 'yaayee', and the invaded army is called the 'sthaayee'. 411











**आरूढे स्वामिमित्रोच्चग्रहयुक्तेऽथ वीक्षिते।**





**स्थायिनो विजयं ब्रूयाद्यायिनो भङ्गमादिशेत्॥४१२॥**











 If the lord of the Aaroodha Raasi, or the friend of that lord is associated with or aspected by an exalted planet, the' sthaayee' will be victorious and the 'yaayee' will return home defeated. 412






**एवं छत्रे विशेषोऽस्ति विपरीते जयो भवेत्।**





**यायी बलं समायाति छत्रे बलसमन्विते।**





**आरूढे बलसंयुक्ते स्थायी विजयमाप्नुयात्॥४१३॥**






 But there is a speciality in the case of the Chhatra Raasi, where the result will be the reverse of the above, i.e. if the Chhatra Raasi is strong, the yaayee will be triumphant. But in the case of the Aaroodha Raasi being strong, he will be firm in his own stand; i.e. the sthaayee will be able to defeat the yaayee. 413






**आरूढे नीचरिपुभिर्ग्रहैर्युक्तेऽथ वीक्षिते।**





**स्थायी परगृहीतस्स्याच्छत्रेष्वेवं विपर्ययः॥४१४॥**






 If the Aaroodha Raasi is debilitated, or associated with or aspected by a malefic, the sthaayee will be captured by the enemy. But if the Chhatra Raasi is in a similar situation, the reverse will happen; *i.e*. the sthaayee will be triumphant, and the enemy will be defeated. 414






**शुभोदये तु पूर्वाह्णे यायिनो विजयो भवेत्।**





**शुभोदये तु सायाह्ने स्थायी विजयमाप्नुयात्॥४१५॥**






 If a benefic is in the Udaya Raasi in the forenoon, the enemy will succeed. But in the evening, if a benefic is in the Udaya Raasi, the sthaayee will succeed. 415











**छत्रारूढोदये वापि क्रूरांशे पापसंयुते।  
तत्काले पृच्छतां सद्यः कलहो जायते महान्॥४१६॥**











 If the Chhatra Raasi, Udaya Raasi or Aaroodha Raasi happens to be fierce or associated with a malefic, prediction has to be made that there will be a fierce battle imminent for the sthaayee. 416











**पृष्ठोदये तथारूढे पापैर्युक्तेऽथ वीक्षिते।**





**दशमे पापसंयुक्ते चतुष्पादुदयेऽपि वा।  
कलहो जायते शीघ्रं सन्धिस्स्याच्छुभवीक्षिते॥४१७॥**











 If the Aaroodha Raasi happens to be a Prushthodaya (rising by the hinder part) and is associated with or aspected by a malefic, or a malefic is posited in the 10th place, or if the Udaya Raasi is quadruped sign, conflict will soon arise. If what is stated above is aspected by a benefic, amity and friendship will take place. 417






**उदयादिषु षट्केषु शुभा राशिषु चेत्स्थिताः।**





**स्थायिनो विजयं ब्रूयादूर्ध्वंचेद्यायिनो जयः॥४१८॥**











**पापग्रहयुते व्यस्तं मिश्रे सन्धिः प्रजायते।  
उभयत्र स्थिताः पापा बलवन्तस्समो जयः॥४१९॥**






 If the six signs from the Udaya Raasi are occupied by benefics, the sthaayee will be triumphant. But if benefics are in signs beyond the six adjacent to the Udaya Raasi, the yaayee will succeed. That is, if the six signs adjacent to the Udaya Raasi are malefics, the sthaayee will be defeated, the yaayee will succeed. But if the malefics are beyond the six signs, the yaayee will be defeated, and the sthaayee will be triumphant. But if both the malefics and benefics are mixed in these signs, friendship will ensue between the two parties. If strong malefics are on either side of the Lagna, *i.e*. in the 2nd and 12th places, the two rival parties will be equal; i.e. the enemy will have scored some successes and the sthaayee some successes. 418–419











**तुर्यादिराशिभिः षड्भिरागतस्य फलं वदेत्।**





**तदन्यराशिभिः षड्भिः स्थायिनः फलमादिशेत्।**





**एवं ग्रहस्थितिवशात्पूर्ववत्कथयेद्बुधः॥४२०॥**






 The strength of the parties has to be assessed thus: The strength of the six signs from the 4th Raasi from Udaya sign determines the enemy's strength; while the six other Raasis beyond give the strength of the yaayee. Thus is prediction to be made in terms of the relative strengths of the planets. 420











**ग्रहोदये विशेषोऽस्ति शन्यर्काङ्गारकोदये।**





**आगतस्य जयं ब्रूयात्स्थायिनो भङ्गमादिशेत्।**





**बुधशुक्रोदये, यायी जयी चन्द्रगुरूदये॥४२१॥**











 Now the effects of planets being in the Udaya Raasi will be described : If at the time of Prasna, Saturn, the Sun or Mars is in Udaya Raasi, success will go to the enemy. If Mercury and Venus are in Udaya Lagna, the sthaayee will be defeated. 421











**पञ्चषड्लाभरिःफेषु तिग्मांशुः संस्थितो यदि।**





**आगतः स्त्रीधनादीनि हृत्वा वस्तूनि गच्छति॥४२२॥**  






 If the Moon or Jupiter is in the Lagna, the enemy will be successful. If the Sun is in the 5th 6th, 11th or 12th place, the enemy will go away, capturing women, wealth and property. 422











**द्वितीये दशमे सौरिर्यदि सेनासमागमः।  
यदि शुक्रः स्थितः षष्ठे योज्यं संधिर्भविष्यति॥४२३॥**











 If Saturn is in the 2nd or 10th place from the Prasna Lagna, there will be clash of arms. If Venus is in the 6th place, there will be peace or settlement. 423











**चतुर्थे पञ्चमे शुक्रो यदि तिष्ठति तत्क्षणात्।**





**स्त्रीघनादीनि वस्तूनि यायी दत्वा प्रयास्यति॥४२४॥**






 If Venus is in the 4th or 5th place, the yaayee will give away women and property to the enemy and run away defeated. 424  

**सप्तमे शुक्रसंयुक्ते स्थायी भवति दुर्बलः।**





**नवाष्टसप्तसहजादन्यत्र हि कुजो यदि।**





**स्थायी विजयमाप्नोति परसेना समागमे॥४२५॥**











 If Venus is in the 7th place, the sthaayee will be weak. If Mars is anywhere except the 9th, 8th, 7th and 3rd places, the sthaayee will fight against the enemy and be successful. 425











**चतुर्थे पञ्चमे चन्द्रे स्थायी च विजयी भवेत्।**





**तृतीये पञ्चमे भानौ यदि सेनासमागमः॥४२६॥**











 If the Moon is in the 4th or 5th place the sthaayee will definitely succeed. If the Sun is in the 3rd or 5th place, there will be clash of arms. 426











**मित्रस्थाने स्थिते संधिर्नोचेत्स्थायी जयी भवेत्।**





**चतुर्थे वित्तदः स्थायी षष्ठे चेत्स्थायिनो मृतिः॥४२७॥**











 If the Sun is in a friend's sign, there will be settlement between the two parties. Otherwise, the sthaayee will succeed. If the Sun is in the 4th place, the sthaayee will give away property to the enemy. If the Sun is in the 6th place, the sthaayee will die. 427











**उदयात्सहजे सौम्ये द्वितीये यदि भास्करः।**





**स्थायिनो विजयं ब्रूयाद्वयत्यस्ते यायिनो जयः॥४२८॥**











 If Mercury is in the 3rd place from the Lagna and the Sun in the 2nd place, the sthaayee will succeed. If it were the reverse, the enemy would succeed. 428











**ससौम्ये भास्करे माते समयुद्धं वदेद्बुधः।  
लग्नात्पञ्चमगे सौम्ये यायी भवति चार्थदः।  
द्वित्रस्थे सोमजे यायी विजयी भवति ध्रुवम्॥। ४२९॥**











 If the Sun and Mercury are together, there will be ceaseless war between the two parties. If Mercury is in the 5th place, the yaayee will give away property to the sthaayee. But if Mercury is in the 2nd and 3rd places, the yaayee will definitely succeed. 429











**एकादशे व्यये सौम्ये स्थायी विजयमेष्यति।**





**एकादशेऽर्के यायी तु हतस्त्रीबान्धवो भवेत्।**





**शत्रुनीचस्थिते सूर्ये स्थायिनो भङ्गमादिशेत्॥४३०॥**











 If Mercury is in the 11th or 12th place, the sthaayee will be triumphant. If the Sun is in the 11th place the yaayee's women and relatives will be killed. If the Sun is in inimical or debi–litated signs, the sthaayee will be defeated. 430






**उदयात्पञ्चमभ्रातृव्ययेषु धिषणो यदि।  
यायी भङ्गं समायाति द्वितीये संधिरुच्यते।**





**दशमैकादशे जीवो यदि याय्यर्थदो भवेत्॥। ४३१॥**











 If Jupiter is in the 5th, 3rd or 12th places from the Udaya Lagna,–the yaayee will be defeated. If Jupiter is in the 2nd place, there will be settlement between the parties. If Jupiter is in the 10th or 11 th place, the yaayee will give away property. 431  

**चन्द्रादित्यौसमस्थाने संधिस्स्यात्तिष्ठतो यदि।**





**विपरीते तु युद्धं स्याद्धानोर्द्वादशगे विधौ।**





**तत्र युद्धं न भवति शास्त्रे ज्ञानप्रदीपके॥४३२॥**











 If the Sun and the Moon are neutral signs, there will be truce and the parties will settle their differences. If it were the reverse, there will be war between the two. If the Moon is in the 12th place to the Sun, there will be no war, says the science of ‘JNAANAPRADEEPIKAA'. 432











**चरराशिस्थिते चन्द्रे चरराश्युदयेपि वा।  
शत्रुरागत्य संधाता विपरीते विपर्ययः॥४३३॥**











 If the Moon is in a moveable sign or a movable sign is rising, the enemy will seek peace. If it is the reverse, the effect too will be reverse. 433











**युग्मराशिस्थिते चन्द्रे स्थिरराश्युदये तथा।**





**अर्द्धराज्यं समागत्य सेनानीर्विनिवर्तते॥४३४॥**











 If the Moon is in an odd sign and a fixed sign is rising, the enemy's commander–in–chief will come halfway into the sthaayee's kingdom and then return home. 434











**सिह्मादिराशिषट्के तु स्थायिनो भङ्गदायकः।**





**कर्कादिव्युत्क्रमात्षट्के यायिनश्चन्द्रमास्थितः।**





**स्थायीयायीक्रमेणैवं ब्रूयाद्ग्रहवशात्फलम्॥४३५॥**











 If the Moon is in Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius and Capricom, the sthaayee will meet only with defeats. But if it is in the other six signs, namely, from Aquarius to Can– cer, the yaayee will be defeated.  
Thus is prediction about success or defeat to the parties made by the position of the planets. 435

**Chapter**XXV**






***ON TRAVEL***






**यात्राकाण्डं प्रवक्ष्यामि सर्वेषां हितलिप्सया।**





**गमनागमनं चैव लाभालाभौ शुभाशुभम्।**





**सर्वं विचार्यकथयेत्पृच्छतां शास्त्रवित्तमः॥४३६॥**






 In the interest of all, I am now describing the auspicious time for travel. After properly examining the details about going, coming, gain, loss, good and bad, the Prasna is to be answered. 436  

**मित्रक्षेत्राणि पश्यन्ति यदि मित्रग्रहास्तदा।**





**मित्रस्यागमनं ब्रूयान्नीचं नीचग्रहा यदि॥४३७॥**






 If friendly planets aspect the friendly signs at the time of Prasna, the arrival of friends is to be predicted. Likewise if weak planets aspect weak signs the arrival of lowly persons is to be expected. 437











**नीचस्यागमनं ब्रूयादुच्चमुच्चग्रहा यदि।  
स्वाधिकाराय गमनं पुंराशौ पुंग्रहा यदि॥४३८॥**











 If exalted planets aspect the exalted signs, the person'stravel on official duty is to be predicted. 438






**पुरुषायेति गमनं स्त्रीराशौ सीग्रहा यदि।**





**स्त्रियै गमनमित्युक्त मन्येष्वेवं विचारयेत्॥४३९॥**











 If male planets are in male signs the travel is in relation to some work with a man; and if female planets are in female signs, the travel is in connection with a woman. Such events are to be expected in other places too. 439











**चरराश्युदयारूढे तत्तद्ग्रहविलोकिते।  
तत्तदाशासु गच्छन्ति प्रष्टारः शास्त्रनिर्णयः॥ ४४०॥**











 If the Udaya and Aaroodha Raasis are moveable signs and are aspected by various planets, travel will be in the direction of the respective planets. 440











**स्थिरराश्युदयारूढे शन्यर्काङ्गारकाः स्थिताः।**





**अथवा दशमस्थाश्चेद्गमनागमने न च॥४४१॥**











 If the Udaya and Aaroodha Raasis are fixed and if Saturn, the Sun and Mars are posited there or in the 10th house, neither arrival nor departure will take place. 441











**शुक्रसौम्येन्दुजीवाश्च तिष्ठन्ति चरराशिषु।  
विद्यते स्वेष्टसिध्यर्थं गमनागमनं तदा॥४४२॥**











 If Venus, Jupiter and the Moon are in moveable signs, travel will take place only in one's own interest. 442











**स्थितिप्रश्ने स्थिति ब्रूयान्मस्तकोदयराशिषु।**





**पृष्ठोदयेषु गमनं क्रमेण शुभदं वदेत्॥४४३॥**











 If Prasna is in connection with travel, if the rising sign is Sirshodaya (head rising,), there will be no travel, and if the Prishthodaya sign is rising, there will be travel, which will be beneficial. 443











**द्वितीये च तृतीये च तिष्ठन्ति यदि पुंग्रहाः।**





**त्रिदिनात्पत्रिकायाति दूतो वा प्रेषितस्य च॥४४४॥**











 If a male planet is in the 2nd or 3rd place from the Prasna Lagna, a letter will come with in three days; or a messenger will come from the person who has gone on travel. 444  

**लग्नार्थसहजव्योमलाभेष्विन्दुज्ञभार्गवाः।  
तिष्ठन्ति यदि तत्काले त्वावृत्तिः प्रेषितस्य च॥४४५॥**











 If the Moon, Mercury or Venus is in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 10th or 11th place, the man who has been sent out will returnsoon. 445






**चतुर्थे द्वादशे वापि तिष्ठन्तश्चेच्छुभग्रहाः।  
पत्रिका प्रेषितस्याशु समायाति न संशयः॥४४६॥**






 If benefits are in the 4th or 12th place, a letter from the man who has gone out will definitely come. 446






**षष्ठे वा पञ्चमे वापि यदि पापग्रहाः स्थिताः।**





**प्रेषितो व्याधिपीडार्तः समायाति न संशयः॥४४७॥**











 If malefics are in the 6th or 5th place from the Prasna Lagna, the man who has gone out will return with sickness. 447  

**चापोक्षछागसिंहेषु यदि तिष्ठति चन्द्रमाः।**





**चिन्तितः पुनरायाति चतुर्थे चेत्तदागमः॥४४८॥**

***OF RAINS***











**जलराशौ तु लग्ने वा जलग्रहनिरीक्षिते।**





**कथयेदृष्टिरस्तीति विपरीते न वर्षति॥४५३॥**






 If the Lagna is a watery sign or if it is aspected by a watery planet, the downpour of rain can be predicted. If it is otherwise, there will be no rainfall. 453











**जलराशिषु शुक्रेन्दु तिष्ठतो वृष्टिरुत्तमा।  
एतौ स्वक्षेत्रमुच्चं वा पश्यतो यदि केन्द्रगौ॥४५४॥**






**त्रिचतुर्दिवसानन्तर्महावृष्टिर्भविष्यति।**





**लग्नाच्चतुर्थे शुक्रस्स्यात्तद्दिने वृष्टिरुत्तमा॥४५५॥**






 If Venus or the Moon is in a watery sign, there will be he heavy downpour; and if Venus or the Moon is aspecting their own housecs, or their exalted signs, or posited in their Kendras. heavy downpour within three or four days can be predicted. If Venus is in the 4th place, rain will fall on the same day when the Prasna is made. 454–455






**जलराशिषु तिष्ठन्ति शुक्रजीवसुधाकराः।**





**आरूढोदयराशींश्चेत्पश्यन्त्यधिकवृष्टयः॥४५६॥**






 If Venus, Jupiter, and the Moon are in watery signs, or aspect the Aaroodha or Udaya Raasi, there will be very heavy downpour. 456






**छत्रे पृष्ठोदये जाते पृष्ठोदयग्रहेक्षिते।  
तत्काले परिवेषादौ दृष्टे वृष्टिर्महत्तरा॥४५७॥**






 If the Chhatra Raasi is a Prishthodaya sign and is aspected by a Prishthodaya planet and at the same time the Parivesha is also seen, heavy rainfall is most likely. 457











**केन्द्रेषु मन्दभौमज्ञराहवो यदि संस्थिताः।**





**वृष्टिर्नास्तीति कथयेदथवा चण्डमारुतः॥४५८॥**






 If Saturn, Mars, Mercury and Rahu are in Kendra, there will be no rainfall, but a big windstorm will blow. 458











**पापास्सौम्यविमिश्राश्चेदल्पवृष्टिर्भविष्यति।**





**चापस्थौ मन्दराहू चेद्वृष्टिर्नास्तीति कीर्तयेत्।**





**शुभः कार्मुकसंस्थश्चद्धोरा वृष्टिर्भविष्यति॥४५९॥**






 If malefics are associated with benefics in a Kendra, the rainfall will be little. If Rahu and Saturn are in Sagittarius at the time of Prasna there will be no rainfall. But if benefics are in Sagittarius, there will be heavy rainfall. 459






**उच्चेन युक्ते दृष्टे वा त्वर्घवृद्धिर्भविष्यति।**

**शुभग्रहयुते वृद्धिरशुभेर्घस्य नाशनम्॥४६१॥**

**Chapter**XXVII**






***OF SHIPS***











**जलराशिषु लग्नेषु जीवशुक्रेन्दवो यदि।**





**पोतसस्यशागमनं ब्रूयादशुभाश्चे न्नहीति च॥४६२॥**






 If Prasna is made about the arrival of ships, the method of answering is given below:–  
 If the Lagna is a watery sign, and if Jupiter, Venus, or the Moon is posited there, the arrival of ships is to be stated. But if malefics are in the Lagna, no ship will come. 462  

**आरूढच्छत्रलग्नेषु वीक्षितेष्वशुभग्रहैः।**





**पोतभंगो भवेन्नीचशत्रुभिर्वा तथा वदेत्॥४६३॥**






 If malefics aspect the Aaroodha or Chhatra Lagna, the ship will sink. Even if debilitated planets or inimical planets aspect the above Lagnas, damage to the ship is to be predicted. 463






**अपृष्ठभोदये लग्ने दृष्टे देशात्तु नौर्व्रजेत्।**





**तद्ग्रहेतु यदा दृष्टे तदा नौदर्शनं भवेत्॥४६४॥**






 If the Lagna is other than a Prishthodaya Raasi, and if the Udaya Lagna is aspected by its lord, the ship will leave thecountry of destination. When the lord of the Lagna is aspected by another planet, the ship will be sighted. 464






**चरराशौ चरच्छत्रे द्रुतमायाति नौस्तदा।**





**चतुर्थे पञ्चमे चन्द्रो यदि नौः शीघ्रमेष्यति॥४६५॥**











 If either the Prasna Lagna or the Chhatra Raasi is a moveable sign, the ship will arrive soon. If the Moon is in the 4th or 5th place, the ship will come very soon. If Venus is in the 2nd or 3rd place, the ship will arrive. Like–wise should other predictions be made after careful investigation. 465

***ACHIEVEMENT***











**द्वितीये वा तृतीये वा शुक्रश्चेन्नौसमागमः।**





**अनेनैव क्रमैणैवं सर्वं वीक्ष्य वदेत्स्फुटम्॥४६६॥**






**लग्नस्थौ कार्यलग्नेशौ कार्यस्थौ लग्नकार्यपौ।**





**कार्यस्य सिद्धिं कुरुतस्तदानीं निश्चयाद्वदेत्॥४६७॥**











**लग्नं लग्नेश्वरः पश्येत्कार्यं पश्येत्तु कार्यपः।**





**कार्येश्वरो लग्नगतः प्रपश्ये ल्लग्नपं तथा॥४६८॥**






**वा विलग्नपतिः कार्यगृहस्थः कार्यपं तथा।**





**पश्येल्लग्नाधिपः कार्यं लग्नं कार्यपतिस्तथा॥४६९॥**











**कार्येशोलग्नपं पश्येल्लग्नेशः कार्यपं तथा।**





**चन्द्रदृष्टिर्यदा चेत्स्यात्कार्यसिद्धिस्तदा स्मृता॥४७०॥**






 The time when the work will be accomplished is stated here: There are seven Yogas when a work will be accomplished successfully: (1) When the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 10th house are in the 10th place; (2) when the lord of the 10th house and the lord of the Lagna are in Lagna; (3) when the Lagna is aspected by the lord of the Lagna or when the lord of the 10th house aspects the 10thhouse; (4) when the lord of the 10th house is in Lagna and aspects the lord of the Lagna; (5) when the lord of the. Lagna is in the 10th house and aspects the lord of the 10th house; (6) when the lord of the Lagna aspects the 10th house and the lord of the 10th aspects the Lagna; and (7) when the lord of the 10th aspects the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the Lagna aspects the lord of the 10th. When the Moon aspects any of the above Yogas, certain accomplishment of the deed is predicted. 466–470  

**असत्स्वपि च योगेघु कार्येशो लग्नराशिगः।**





**भविष्यति तदा काले कार्यं ज्ञानप्रदीपके॥४७१॥**






 Even if these Yogas are not available, when the lord of the 10th house during his usual transit reaches the Lagna, the achievement of the work is to be predicted, says the science of *Gnaanapradeepikaa*. 471











**सम्यग्विचार्य प्रवदेन्न मिथ्यावाग्भविष्यति।**





**प्रश्नादर्शमिदं शास्त्रं पृथिच्यांलोकभूषणम्॥४७२॥**











 If one carefully studies this science and gives his prediction after proper investigation, his words will not become a lie. This science of Prasna is an ornament to the world, provided it is applied rightly.472
