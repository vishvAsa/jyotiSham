<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>Soon after I was appointed Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology in the Presidency College at Madras, and in that capacity took charge of the office of the Curator of the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, the late Mr. G. H. Stuart, who was then the Director of Public Instruction, asked me to find out if in the Manuscripts Library in my charge there was any work of value capable of throwing new light on the history of Hindu mathematics, and to publish it, if found, with an English translation and with such notes as were necessary for the elucidation of its contents. Accordingly the mathematical manuscripts in the Library were examined with this object in view; and the examination revealed the existence of three incomplete manuscripts of Mahāvīrācārya&rsquo;s <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>. A cursory perusal of these manuscripts made the value of this work evident in relation to the history of Hindu Mathematics. The late Mr. G. H. Stuart&rsquo;s interest in working out this history was so great that, when the existence of the manuscripts and the historical value of the work were brought to his notice, he at once urged me to try to procure other manuscripts and to do all else that was necessary for its proper publication. He gave me much advice and encouragement in the early stages of my endeavour to publish it; and I can well guess how it would have gladdened his heart to see the work published in the form he desired. It has been to me a source of very keen regret that it did not please Providence to allow him to live long enough to enable me to enhance the value of the publication by means of his continued guidance and advice; and my consolation now is that it is something to have been able to carry out what he with scholarly delight imposed upon me as a duty.<br>
Of the three manuscripts found in the library one is written on paper in Grantha characters, and contains the first five chapters of the work with a running commentary in Sanskrit; it has been denoted here by the letter P. The remaining two are palm-leaf manuscripts in Kanarese characters, one of them containing, like P, the first five chapters, and the other the seventh chapter dealing with the geometrical measurement of areas. In both these manuscripts there is to be found, in addition to the Sanskrit text of the original work, a brief statement in the Kanarese language of the figures relating to the various illustrative problems as also of the answers to those same problems. Owing to the common characteristics of those manuscripts and also owing to their not overlapping one another in respect of their contents, it has been thought advisable to look upon them as one manuscript and denote them by K. Another manuscript, denoted by M, belongs to the Government Oriental Library at Mysore, and was received on loan from Mr. A. Mahadeva Sastri, B.A., the Curator of that institution. This manuscript is a transcription on paper in Kanarese characters of an original palm-leaf manuscript belonging to a Jaina Pandit, and contains the whole of the work with a short commentary in the Kanarese language by one Vallabha, who claims to be the author of also a Telugu commentary on the same work. Although incorrect in many places, it proved to be of great value on account of its being complete and containing the Kanarese commentary; and my thanks arespecially due to Mr. A. Mahadeva Sastri for his leaving it sufficiently long at my disposal. A fifth manuscript, denoted by B, is a transcription on paper in Kanarese characters of a palm-leaf manuscript found in a Jaina monastery at Mudbidri in South Canara, and was obtained through the kind effort of Mr. R. Krishnamacharyar, M.A., the Sub-assistant Inspector of Sanskrit Schools in Madras, and Mr. U. B. Venkataramanaiya of Mudbidri. This manuscript also contains the whole work, and gives, like K, in Kanarese a brief statement of the problems and their answers. The endeavour to secure more manuscripts having proved fruitless, the work has had to be brought out with the aid of these five manuscripts; and owing to the technical character of the work and its elliptical and often riddle-like language and the inaccuracy of the manuscripts, the labour involved in bringing it out with the translation and the requisite notes has been heavy and trying. There is, however, the satisfaction that all this labour has been bestowed on a worthy work of considerable historical value.<br>
It is a fortunate circumstance about the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> that the time when its author Mahāvīrācārya lived may be made out with fair accuracy. In the very first chapter of the work, we have, immediately after the two introductory stanzas of salutation to Jina Mahāvīra, six stanzas describing the greatness of a king, whose name is said to have been Cakrikā bhañjana, and who appears to have been commonly known by the title of Amōghavarṣa Nṛpatuṅga; and in the last of these six stanzas there is a benediction wishing progressive prosperity to the rule of this king. The results of modern Indian epigraphical research show that this king Amōghavarṣa Nṛpatuṅga reigned from A.D. 814 or 815 to AD. 877 or 878<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Since it appears probable that the author of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> was in some way attached to the court of this Rāṣṭrakūṭa king Amōghavarṣa Nṛpatuṅga, we may consider the work to belong to the middle of the ninth century of the Christian era. It is now generally accepted that, among well-known early Indian mathematicians Āryabhaṭa lived in the fifth, Varāhamihirain the sixth, Brahmagupta in the seventh and Bhāskarācārya in the twelfth century of the Christian era; and chronologically, therefore, Mahāvīrācārya comes between Brahmagupta and Bhāskarācārya. This in itself is a point of historical noteworthiness; and the further fact that the author of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> belonged to tho Kanarese speaking portion of South India in his days and was a Jaina in religion is calculated to give an additional importance to the historical value of his work. Like the other mathematicians mentioned above, Mahāvīrācārya was not primarily an astronomer, although he knew well and has himself remarked about the usefulness of mathematics for the study of astronomy. The study of mathematics seems to have been popular among Jaina scholars; it forms, in fact, one of their four <em>aruyōgas</em> or auxiliary sciences indirectly serviceable for the attainment of the salvation of soul-liberation known as <em>mokṣa</em>.</p>
<p>A comparison of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> with the corresponding portions in the <em>Brahmasphuṭa-siddhānta</em> of Brahmagupta is calculated to lead to the conclusion that, in all probability, Mahāvīrācārya was familiar with the work of Brahmagupta and endeavoured to improve upon it to the extent to which the scope of his <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> permitted such improvement. Mahāvīrācārya&rsquo;s classification of arithmetical operations is simpler, his rules are fuller and he gives a large number of examples for illustration and exercise. Pṛthūdakasvāmin, the well-known commentator on the <em>Brahmasphuṭa-siddhānta</em>, could not have been chronologically far removed from Mahāvīrācārya, and the similarity of some of the examples given by the former with some of those of the latter naturally arrests attention. In any case it cannot be wrong to believe, that, at the time, when Mahāvīrācārya wrote his <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>, Brahmagupta must have been widely recognized as a writer of authority in the field of Hindu astronomy and mathematics. Whether Bhāskarācārya was at all acquainted with the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> of Mahāvīrācārya, it is not quite easy to say. Since neither Bhāskarācārya nor any of his known commentators seem to quote from him or mention him by name, the natural conclusion appears to be thatBhāskarācārya&rsquo;s <em>Siddhānta-śiromaṇi</em>, including his Lilāvati and Bījagaṇita, was intended to be an improvement in the main upon the <em>Brahmasphuṭa-siddhānta</em> of Brahmagupta. The fact that Mahāvīrācārya was a Jaina might have prevented Bhāskarācārya from taking note of him; or it may be that the Jaina mathematician&rsquo;s fame had not spread far to the north in the twelfth century of the Christian era. His work, however, seems to have been widely known and appreciated in Southern India. So early as in the course of the eleventh century and perhaps under the stimulating influence of the enlightened rule of Rājarājanarēndra of Rajahmundry, it was translated into Telugu in verse by Pāvulūri Mallana; and some manuscripts of this Telugu translation are now to be found in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library here at Madras. It appeared to me that to draw suitable attention to the historical value of Mahāvīrācārya&rsquo;s <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>, I could not do better than seek the help of Dr. David Eugene Smith of the Columbia University of New York, whose knowledge of the history of mathematics in the West and in the East is known to be wide and comprehensive, and who on the occasion when he met me in person at Madras showed great interest in the contemplated publication of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> and thereafter read a paper on that work at the Fourth International Congress of Mathematicians held at Rome in April 1908. Accordingly I requested him to write an introduction to this edition of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>, giving in brief outline what he considers to be its value in building up the history of Hindu mathematics. My thanks as well as the thanks of all those who may asscholars become interested in this publication are therefore due to him for his kindness is having readily complied with my request; and I feel no doubt that his introduction will be read with great appreciation.</p>
<p>Since the origin of the decimal system of notation and of the conception and symbolic representation of zero are considered to be important questions connected with the history of Hindu-mathematics, it is well to point out here that in the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> twenty-four notational places are mentioned, commencing with the units place and ending with the place called mahākṣōbha, and that the value of each succeeding place is taken to be ten times the value of the immediately preceding place. Although certain words forming the names of certain things are utilized in this work to represent various numerical figures, still in the numeration of numbers with the aid of such words the decimal system of notation is almost invariably followed. If we took the words <em>moon, eye, fire</em>, and <em>sky</em> to represent respectively 1, 2, 3 and 0as their Sanskrit equivalants are understood in this work, then, forinstance, <em>fire-sky-moon-eye</em> would denote the number 3012, and <em>moon-eye-sky-fire</em> would denote 1203, since these nominal numerals denoting numbers are generally repeatedin order from the units place upwards. This combination of nominal numerals and the decimal system of notation has been adopted obviously for the sake of securing metrical convenience and avoiding at the same time cumbrous ways of mentioning numerical expressions; and it may well be taken for granted that for the use of such nominal numerals as well as the decimal system of notation Mahāvīrācārya was indebted to his predecessors. The decimal system of notation is distinctly described by Āryabhaṭa, and there is evidence in his writings to show that he was familiar with nominal numerals. Even in his brief mnemonic method of reperesenting numbers by certain combinations of the consonants and vowels found in the Sanskrit language, the decimal system of notation is taken for granted; and ordinarily 19 notational places are provided for therein. Similarly in Brahmagupta&rsquo;s writings also there is evidence to show that he was acquainted with the use of nominal numerals and the decimal system of notation. Both Āryabhaṭa and Brahmagupta claim that their astronomical works are related to the <em>Brahma-siddhānta</em>; and in a work of this name, which is said to form a part of what is called <em>Śakalya-sāṁihitā</em> and of which a manuscript copy is to be found in the Governmert Oriental Manuscripts Library here, numbers are expressed mainly by nominal numerals used in accordance with the decimal system of notation. It is not of course meant to convey that this work is necessarily the same as what was known to Āryabhaṭa and Brahmagupta; and the fact of its using nominal numerals and the decimal system of notation is mentioned here for nothing more than what it may be worth.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that the origin of the conception of zero is primarily due to the invention and practical utilization of a system of notation wherein the several numerical figures used have place-values apart from what is called their intrinsic value. In writing out a number according to such a system of notation, any notational place may be left empty when no figure with an intrinsic value is wanted there. It is probable that owing to this very reason the Sanskrit word <em>śūnya</em>, meaning &rsquo;empty&rsquo;, came to denote the zero; and when it is borne in mind that the English word &lsquo;cipher&rsquo; isderived from an Arabic word having the same meaning as the Sanskrit <em>śūnya</em>, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that in this country the conception of the zero came naturally in the wake of the decimal system of notation: and so early as in the fifth century of the Christian era, Āryabhaṭa is known to have been fully aware of this valuable mathematical conception. And in regard to the question of a symbol to represent this conception, it is well worth bearing in mind that operations with the zero cannot be carried on - not to say cannot be even thought of easily - without a symbol of some sort to represent it. Mahāvīrācārya gives, in the very first chapter of his<em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>, the results of the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division carried on in relation to the zero quantity; and although he is wrong in saying that a quantity, when divided by zero, remains unaltered, and should have said, like Bhāskarācārya, that the quotient in such a case is infinity, still the very mention of operations in relation to zero is enough to show that Mahāvīrācārya must have been aware of some symbolic representation of the zero quantity. Since Brahmagupta, who must have lived at least 150 years before Mahāvīrācārya, mentions in his work the results of operations in relation to the zero quantity, it is not unreasonable to suppose that before his time the zero must have had a symbol to represent it in written calculations. That even Āryabhaṭa knew such a symbol is not at all improbable. It is worthy of note in this connection that in enumerating the nominal numerals in the first chapter of his work, Mahāvīrācārya mentions the names denoting the nine figures from I to 9, and then gives in the end the names denoting zero, calling all the ten by the names of <em>sāṅkhya</em>: and from this fact also, the inference may well be drawn that the zero had a symbol, and that it was well known that with the aid of the ten digitsand the decimal system of notation numerical quantities of all values may be definitely and accurately expressed. What this known zero-symbol was, is, however, a different question.</p>
<p>The labour and attention bestowed upon the study and translation and annotation of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>have made it clear to me that I was justified in thinking that its publication might prove useful in elucidating the condition of mathematical studies as they flourished in South India among the Jainas in the ninth century of the Christian era, and it has been to me a source of no small satisfaction to feel that in bringing out this work in this form, I have not wasted my time and thought on an unprofitable undertaking. The value of the work is undoubtedly more historical than mathematical. But it cannot be denied that the step by step construction of the history of Hindu culture is a worthy endeavour, and that even the most insignificant labourer in the field of such an endeavour deserves to be looked upon as a useful worker. Although the editing of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em> has been to me a labour of love and duty, it has often been felt to be heavy and taxing; and I, therefore, consider that I am specially bound to acknowledge with gratitude the help which I have received in relation to it. In the early stage, when conning and collating and interpreting the manuscripts was the chief work to be done, Mr. M. B. Varadaraja Aiyangar, B.A., B.L., who is an Advocate of the Chief Court at Bangalore, co-operated with me and gave me an amount of aid for which I now offer him my thanks. Mr. K. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, B.A., of the Madras Christian College, has also rendered considerable assistance in this manner; and to him also I offer my thanks. Latterly I have had to consult on a few occasions Mr. P. V. Seshu Aiyar, B.A., L.T., Professor of Mathematical Physics in the Presidency College here, in trying to explain the rationale of some of the rules given in the work; and I am much obliged to him for his ready willingness in allowing me thus to take advantage of his expert knowledge of mathematics. My thanks are, I have to say in conclusion, very particularly due to Mr. P. Varadacharyar, B.A., Librarian of the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library at Madras, but for whose zealous and steady co-operation with me throughout and careful and continued attention to details, it would indeed have been much harder for me to bring out this edition of the <em>Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha</em>.</p>

<p>ON TERMINOLOGY.</p>
<p><strong>Salutation and Benediction</strong>,</p>
<ol>
<li>Salutation to Mahāvīra, the Lord of the Jinas, the protector (of the faithful), whose four<sup id="fnref:170"><a href="#fn:170" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">170</a></sup> infinite attributes, worthy to be esteemed in (all) the three worlds, are unsurpassable(in excellence).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I bow to that highly glorious Lord of the Jinas, by whom, as forming the shining lamp of the knowledge of numbers, the whole of the universe has been made to shine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That blessed Amōghavarṣa (i.e., one who showers down truly useful rain), who (ever) wishes to do good to those whom he loves, and by whom the whole body of animals and vegetables, having been freed from (the effects of) pests and drought, has been made to feel delighted :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, in whose mental operations, conecived as fire, the enemies in the form of sins have all been turned into the condition of ashes, and who in consequence has become one whose anger is not futile :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, who, having brought all the world under his control and being himself independent, has not been overcome by (any) opponents, and is therefore an absolute lord (like) anew God of Love:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, to whom the work (of service) is rendered by a circle of kings, who have been overpowered by the progress of (his) heroism, and who, being Cakrikābhañjanaby name, is in reality a <em>cakrikābhañjana</em>(i.e., the destroyer of the cycle of recurring re-births) :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, who, being the receptacle of the (numerous) rivers of learning, is characterised by the adamantine bank of propriety and holds the gems (of Jainism) within, and (so) is appropriately famous as the great ocean of moral excellence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May (his rule) - the rule of that sovereign lord, who has destroyed in philosophical controversy the position of single conclusions and propounds the logic of the <em>syādvāda¹</em> - (may the rule) of that Nṛpatuṅga prosper!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>An Appreciation of the Science of Calculation.</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>In all those transactions which relate to worldly, Vedicor (other) similarly religious affairs, calculation is of use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the science of love, in the science of wealth, in music and in the drama, in the art of cooking, and similarly in medicine and in things like the knowledge of architecture :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In prosody, in poeties and poetry, in logicand grammar and such other things, and in relation to all that constitutes the peculiarvalue of (all) the (various) arts: the science of computation is held in high esteem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to the movements of the sun and other heavenly bodies, in connection with eclipses and the conjunctions of planets, and in connection with the <em>tripraṡna</em><sup id="fnref:171"><a href="#fn:171" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">171</a></sup>, Daśā (position) and Kāla (time) appertaining to the planets and other heavenly bodies.&quot;)and the course of the moon - indeed in all these (connections) it is utilised</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>13-14. The number, the diameter and the perimeter of islands, oceans and mountains; the extensive dimensions of the rows of habitations and halls belonging to the inhabitants of the (earthly) world, of the interspace (between the worlds), of the world of light, and of the world of the gods; (as also the dimensions of those belonging) to the dwellers in hell : and (other) miscellaneous measurements of all sorts - all these are made out by means of computation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The syādvāda is a process of reasening adopted by the Jainas in relation to the question of the reality or otherwise of the totality of the perceptible objects found in the phenomenal universe. The word is translatable as the may-be-argument; and this may-be-argument declares that the phenomenal universe (1) may be real (2) may not be real (3) may and may not be real (4) may be indescribable, (5) may be real and indescribable. (6) may be unreal and indescribable, and (7) may be real and unreal and indescribable. The position represented by this argument is not, therefore, one of a single conclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The configuration of living beings therein, the length of their lives, their eight attributes and other similar things, their progress and other such things, their staying together and such other things - all these are dependent upon computation (for their due measurement and comprehension).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the good of saying much in vain ?Whatever there is in all the three worlds, which are possessed of moving and non-moving beings
-all that indeed cannot exist as apart from measurement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>17-19. With the help of the accomplished holy sages, who are worthy to be worshipped by the lords of the world, and of their disciples and disciples&rsquo; disciples, who constitute the well-known jointed series of preceptors, I gleanfrom the great occan of the knowledge of numbers a little of its essence, in the manuer in which gems are (picked up) from the sea, gold is from the stony rock and the pearl from the oyster shell;and give out, according to the power of my intelligence, the <em>Sārasaṅgraha</em>, a small work on arithmetic, which is (however) not small in value.</p>
<p>20-23. Accordingly, from this ocean of <em>Sārasaṅgraha</em>, which is filled with the water of terminology and has the (eight) arithmetical operations for its bank; which (again) is full of the bold rofling fish represented by the operations relating to fractions, and is characterised by the great crocodile represented by the chapter of miscellaneous examples; which (again) is possessed of the waves represented by the chapter on the rule-of-three, and is variegated in splendour through the lustre of the gems represented by the excellent language relating to the chapter on mixed problems; and which (again) possesses the extensive bottom represented by the chapter on area-problems, and has the sands represented by the chapter on the cubic contents of excavations; and wherein (finally) shines forth the advancing tide represented by the chapter on shadows, which is related to the department of practical calculation in astronomy - (from this ocean) arithmeticians possessing the necessary qualifications in abundance will, through the instrumentality of calculation, obtain such pure gems as they desire.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>For the reason that it is not possible to know without (proper) terminology the import of anything, at the (very) commencement of this sciencethe required terminology is mentioned.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Terminology relating to the measurement of) Space.</strong></p>
<p>25-27. That infinitely minute (quantity of) matter, which is not destroyed by water, by fire and by other such things, is called a <em>paramāṇū</em>. An endless number of them makes an aṇuwhich is the first (measure) here. The <em>trasarēṇu</em> which is derived therefrom, the <em>rathaēṇu</em>, thence (derived), the hair-measure, the louse-measure, the sesamum-measure, which (last) is the same as the mustard-measure, then the barley-measure and (then) the <em>aṅgula</em> are (all) - in the case of (all) those who are born in the worlds of enjoyment and the worlds of work, which are (all) differentiated as superior, middling and inferior - eight-fold (as measured in relation to what immediately precedes each of them), in the order (in which they are mentioned). This <em>aṅgula</em> is known as <em>vyavahārāṅgula</em>.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>
<p>Those, who are acquainted with the processes of measurement, say that five-hundred of this (<em>vyavahārāṅgula</em>) constitutes (another <em>aṅgula</em> known as) <em>paramāṇa</em>. The finger measure of men now existing forms their own <em>aṅgula</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They hold that in the established usage of the world the <em>aṅgula</em> is of three kinds, <em>vyavahāra</em> and <em>paramāṇa</em> constituting two (of them), and (then there being) one&rsquo;s own <em>aṅgula</em>; and six <em>aṅgulas</em> make the foot-measure as measured across.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two (such) feet make a <em>vitasti</em>; and twice that is a <em>hasta.</em> Four <em>hastas</em> make a <em>daṇḍa</em>, and two thousands of that make a <em>krōśa</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who are well versed in the measurement of space (or surface-area) say that four <em>krōśas</em>form a<em>yōjana</em>. After this, I mention in due order the terminology relating to (the measurement of) time.</p>

<p>A measured number of <em>āvalis</em>makes an <em>ucchvāsa</em>; seven <em>ucchvāsas</em> make one <em>stōka</em>; seven <em>stōkas</em> make one <em>lava</em>, and with thirty-eight and a half of this the <em>ghaṭī</em> is formed.</p>

<p><strong>Names of the Operations in Arithmetic.</strong></p>
<ol start="46">
<li>
<p>The first among these (operations) is guṇākāra (multiplication), and it is also (called) <em>pratyutpanna</em>; the second is what is known as bhāgākāra (division); and kṛti (squaring) is said to be the third.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth, as a matter of course, is <em>varga-mūla</em> (square root), and the fifth is said to be <em>ghana</em> (cubing); then <em>ghanamūla</em>(cube root) is the sixth, and the seventh is known as <em>citi</em> (summation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is also spoken of as <em>saṅkalita</em>. Then the eighth is <em>vyutkalita</em> (the subtraction of a part of a series, taken from the beginning, from the wholeseries), and this is also spoken of as <em>śēṣa</em>. All these eight (operations) appertain to fractions also.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>General rules in regard to zero and positive and negative quantities.</strong></p>
<ol start="49">
<li>A number multiplied by zero is zero, and that (number) remains unchanged when it is divided by<sup id="fnref:172"><a href="#fn:172" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">172</a></sup>, combined with (or) diminished by zero. Multiplication and other operations in relation to zero (give rise to) zero; and in the operation of addition, the zero becomes the same as what is added to it.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="50">
<li>
<p>In multiplying as well as dividing two negative (or) two positive. (quantities, one by the other), the result is a positive (quantity). But it is a negative quantity in relation to two (quantities), one (of which is) positive and the other negative. In adding a positive and a negative (quantity, the result) is (their) difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The addition of two negative (quantities or) of twopositive(quantities gives rise to) a negative or positive (quantity) in order. A positive (quantity) which has to be subtracted from a (given) number beeomes negative, and a negative (quantity) which has to be (so) subtracted becomes positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The square of a positive as well as of a negative (quantity) is positive; and the square roots of these (square quantities) are positive and negative in order. As in the nature of thingsa negative (quantity) is not a square (quantity), it has therefore no square root.</p>

<p>53-62. [These stanzasgive certain names of certain things, which names are frequently used to denote figures and numbers in arithmetical notation. They are not therefore translated here, but the reader is referred to the appendix where an alphabetical list of such of these names as occur in this work is given with their ordinary and numerical meanings.]</p>
<p><strong>The names of Notational Places.</strong></p>
<ol start="63">
<li>
<p>The first place is what is known as <em>ēka</em> (unit); the second place is named <em>daśa</em> (ten); the third they call as <em>śata</em> (hundred), while the fourth is <em>sahasra</em> (thousand).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fifth is daśa-<em>sahasra</em> (ten-thousand) and the sixth is no other than lakṣa(lakh). The seventh is daśa-lakṣa(ten-Inkh) and the eighth is said to be <em>kōṭī</em> (crore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ninth is <em>daśa-kōṭī</em> (ten-crore) and the tenth is <em>śata-kōṭī</em>(hundred-crore). The (place) characterised by eleven is <em>arbuda</em> and the twelfth (place) is <em>nyarbuda</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thirteenth place is <em>kharva</em> and the fourteenth is <em>mahā-kharva</em>. Similarly the fifteenth is <em>padma</em> and the sixteenth <em>mahā-padma</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again the seventeenth is <em>kṣōṇī</em>, the eighteenth <em>mahā</em>-<em>kṣōṇī</em>. The nineteenth place is <em>śaṅkha</em> and the twentieth is <em>mahā</em>-<em>śaṅkha</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The twenty-first place is kṣity<em>ā</em>, the twenty-second <em>mahā-kṣityā</em>. Then the twenty-third is <em>kṣōbha</em>and the twenty-fourth <em>mahā</em>-<em>kṣōbha</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By means of the (following) eight qualities, viz., quick method in working, forethought as to whether a desirable result may be arrived at, or as to whether an undesirable result will be produced, freedom from dullness, correct comprehension, power of retention, and the devising of new means in working, along with getting at those numbers which make (unknown) quantities known - (by means of these qualities) an arithmetician is to bo known as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great sages have briefly stated the terminology thus. What has to be further said (about it) in detail must be learnt from (a study of) the science (itself).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Thus ends the chapter on Terminology in Sāra-saṅgraha, which is a work on arithmetic by Mahāvīrācārya.</strong></p>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>ARITHMETICAL OPERATIONS.</p>
<p><strong>The First Subject of Treatment.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound the first subject of treatment, which is named <em>Parikarman</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication.</strong></p>
<p>The rule of work in relation to the operation of multiplication, which is the first (among the <em>parikarman</em> operations), is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>After placing (the multiplicand and the multiplier onebelow the other) in the manner of the hinges of a door, the multiplicand should be multiplied by the multiplier, in accordance with (either of) the two methods of normal (or) reverse working, by adopting the process of (i) dividing the multiplicand and multiplying the multiplier by a factor of the multiplicand, (ii) of dividing the multiplier and multiplying the multiplicandby a factor of the multiplier, or (iii) of using them (in the multiplication) as they are (in themselves).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1</strong>. Symbolically expressed, this rule works out thus: In multiplying ab by cd, the product is $\frac{ab}{a}~ \times ~(a~ \times ~cd)$; or (ii) $(ab~ \times ~c)~ \times ~\frac{cd}{c}$ ; or <em>a**b</em>×<em>c**d</em>. Obviously the object of the first two devices here is to facilitate working through the choice of suitable factors.The anulōma or normal method of working is the one that is generally followed. The vilōma or the reverse method of working is as follows: To multiply 1998 by 27:</p>

<p><strong>Squaring.</strong></p>
<p>The rule of work in relation to the operation of squaring, which is the third (among the <em>parikarman</em> operations), is as follows:-</p>

<p><strong>30</strong>. The word translated by place here is स्थान, it obviously means a place in notation. Here, as a commentary interpretsit, it may also denote the component parts of a sum, as each such part has a place in the sum. According to both these interpretations the rule works out correctly.<br>
For instance, (1234)²= (1000² + 200² + 30² + 4²) + 2 x (1000 x 200) + 2 x (1000 x 30) +2 x (1000 x 4) + 2 x (200 x 30) + 2 x 200 X 4 + 2 x (30 x 4).<br>
Similarly (1+2+3+ 4)² = (1² + 2² + 3² + 4²) + 2(1 x 2 +1x 3 + 1x 4 + 2x 3 + 2 x 4 + 3 x 4).</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Get the square of the last figure (in the number, the order of counting the figures being from the right to the left,) and then multiply this last (figure), after it is doubled and pushed on (to the right by one notational place), by (the figures found in) the remaining places. Each of the remaining figures (in the number) is to be pushed on (by one place) and then dealt with similarly. This is the method of squaring.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>

<p><strong>Square Root.</strong></p>
<p>The rule of work in relation to the operation of (extracting) the square root, which is the fourth (of the <em>parikarman</em> operations) is as follows:</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>From the (number represented by the figures up to the) last odd place (of notation counted from the right), subtract the (highest possible) square number; then multiply the root (of this number) by two, and divide with this (product the number represented by taking into position the figure belonging to) the (next) even place; and then the square of the quotient (soobtained) is to be subtracted from the (number represented by taking into position the figure belonging to the next) odd place. (If it is so continued till the end), the half of the (last) doubled quantity (comes to be) the resulting square root.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="37">

<p>Tell me, friend, after considering well, the square roots of 1296 and 625.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>36</strong>. To illustrate the rule, the following example is worked out below:-</p>
<p>To extract the squnre root of 65536:<br>
6 \। 55 \। 36</p>
<p>2²= 4</p>
<p>2x 2 = 4)25(5</p>

</ol>
<p>Thus ends square root, the fourth of the operations known as <em>Parikarman</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Cubing.</strong></p>
<p>The rule of work in relation to the operation of cubing, which is the fifth (of the <em>parikarman</em> operations), is as follows:-</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>
<p>The product of (any) three equal quantities: or the product obtained by the multiplication of any (given) quantity by that (given quantity) as diminished by a chosen quantity and (then again) by that (given quantity) as increased by the (same) chosen quantity, when combined with the square of the chosen quantity as multiplied by the least (of the above three quantities) and (combined) also with the cube of the chosen quantity: gives rise to a cubicquantity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or, the summing up of a series in arithmetical progression, of which the first term is the quantity,(the cube whereof is) required, the common difference is twice this quantity, and the number of terms is (equal to) this (same given) quantity, (gives rise to the cube of the given quantity). Or, the square of the quantity (the cube whereof is required), when combined with the product (obtained by the multiplication) of this given quantity diminished by one by the sum of a series in arithmetical progression in which the first term is <em>one</em>, the common difference is <em>two</em> and the number of terms is (equal to) the given quantity, (gives rise to the cube of the given quantity).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>43</strong>. Symbolically expressed, this rule works out thus:<br>
(1) <em>a</em>×<em>a</em>×<em>a</em>=<em>a</em>³ : (ii) <em>a</em>(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)<em>b</em>²(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)+<em>b</em>³=<em>a</em>³</p>
<p><strong>44</strong>. Algebraically, this rule means -<br>
(i) <em>a</em>³=<em>a</em>+3<em>a</em>+5<em>a</em>+7<em>a</em>+ &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;to a terms.</p>
<p>ii) <em>a</em>³=<em>a</em>²+(<em>a</em>−1)(1+3+5+7+ &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;to a terms).</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>
<p>In an arithmetically progressive series, wherein <em>one</em> is the first term as well as the common difference, and the number of terms is (equal to) the given number, multiply the preceding terms by the immediately following ones. The sum of the products (so obtained), when multiplied by <em>three</em> and combined with the last term (in the above series in arithmetical progression), becomes the cube (of the given quantity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Ina given quantity), the squares of (the number represented by the figures in) the last place as also (by those in) the other (remaining places) are taken; and each of these (squares) is multiplied by the number of the other place and also by <em>three</em>; the sum of the two (quantities resulting thus), when combined again with the cubes of the numbers corresponding to all the (optional) places, (gives rise to) the cube (of the given quantity).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>47<sup id="fnref:187"><a href="#fn:187" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">187</a></sup>. Or, the cube of the last figure (in the number counted from right to left is to be obtained); and thricethe square (of that last figure) is to be pushed on (to the right by onenotational place) and multiplied by (the number represented by the figures found inthe) remaining (places); then the square of this (number represented by the figures found in the) remaining (places) is to be pushed on (as above) and multiplied by thrice the last figure (above-mentioned). These (three quantities) are then to beplaced in position (and then summed up). Such is the rule (to be carried out) here.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="48">

<strong>46</strong>. 3<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>+3<em>a**b</em>²+<em>a</em>³+<em>b</em>³=(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)³. To make the rule general and applicable to numbers having more than two places, it is clearly impliedhere that 3<em>a</em>²(<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>)+3<em>a</em>(<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>)²+<em>a</em>³+(<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>)³=(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>)³; and it is obvious that any number may be represented as the sum of two other suitably chosen numbers.</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>
<p>The number 213 is cubed; and twice, thrice, four times and five times that (number are) also (cubed; find ont the corresponding quantities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is seen that 168 multiplied by all the numbers from 1 to 8 is related (as base) to the required cubes. Give outthose cubes quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you, who have seen the other shore of the deep and excellent ocean of the practice of (arithmetical) operations, write down the figures 4, 0, 6, 0, 5, and 9 in order (from right to left), and work out the cube of the number (represented by those figures), and mention the result at once.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus endscubing, the fifth of the operations known as <em>Parikarman</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Cube Root.</strong></p>
<p>The ruleof work in relation to the operation of extracting the cube root, which is the sixth (among the <em>parikarman</em> operations), is as follows:-</p>
<ol start="53">
<li>From (the number represented by the figures up to) the last <em>ghana</em> place, subtract the (highest possible) cube; then divide the(number represented by the next) <em>bhājya</em> place (after it is taken into position) by three times the square of the root (of that cube); then subtract from the (number represented by the next) <em>śōdhya</em>place (after it is taken into position) the square of the (above) quotient as multiplied by <em>three</em> and by the already mentioned (root of the highest possible cube); and then (subtract) fromthe (number represented by the figure in the next) <em>ghana</em> place(after it is taken into position) the cube (of this same quotient).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>53 and 54</strong>. The figures in any given number, the cube-root whereof is required are conceived in these rules to be divided into groups, each of which consistsas far as possible of three figures, named, in the order from right to left, as<em>ghana</em> or that which is cubic, that is, from which the cube is to be subtracted,as<em>śōdhya</em> or that which is to be subtracted from, and a <em>bhājya</em> or that which is to be divided. The <em>bhājya</em>and <em>śōdhya</em> are also known as <em>aghana</em>or non-cubic. The last group on the left need not always consist of all these three figures;it mayconsist of one or two or three figures, as the case may be. The rule mentioned will be clear from the following worked out example.</p>
<p>To extract the cube root of 77308776:-</p>
<p>ś. gh. bh. ś. gh. bh. s. gh,</p>
<p>7  7 \। 3  0  8 \। 7  7  6</p>
<p>gh. &hellip;   &hellip;  4³      = 6  4</p>
<p>bh. &hellip;  &hellip;   4² x 3 = 48)133(2</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>ś. &hellip;  &hellip;  2²x 3 x 4 =    48</p>
<p>3228</p>
<p>gh. &hellip;  &hellip;..   2³  =        8</p>
<p>bh. &hellip;  &hellip; 42² x 3 = 5292)32207(6</p>
<p>31752</p>
<p>4557</p>
<p>ś. &hellip;  &hellip; 6²x 3 x 42 =   4536</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>gh. &hellip;  &hellip;..   6³  =       216</p>
<p>Cube root = 426.</p>
<p>The rule does not state what figures constitute the cube root; but it is meant that the cube root is the number made up of the figures which are en bed in this operation, written down in the order from above from left to right.</p>
<ol start="54">
<li>One(figure in the various groups of three figures) is cubic: two are non-cubic. Divide (the non-cubic figure) by three times the square the cube root. From the (next) non-cubic(figure) subtract the square of the quotient (obtained as above and) multiplied, by three times the previously mentioned (cube-root of the highest cube that can be subtracted from the previous cubic figure) and (then subtract) the cube of the (above) quotient (from the next cubic figure as taken into position). With the help of the cuberoot-figures (so) obtained (and taken into position, the procedure is) as before.</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus ends cube root, the sixth of the orerations known as <em>Parikarmen</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Summation.</strong></p>
<p>The rule of work in relation to the operation of summation of series, which is the seventh (among the <em>parikaman</em> operations), is as follows:</p>
<ol start="61">
<li>The number of terms in the series is (first) diminished by <em>one</em> and (is then) halved and multiplied by the common difference; this when combined with the first term in the series and (then) multiplied by the number of terms (therein) becomes the sum of all (the terms in the series in arithmetical progression).</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for obtaining the sum of the series in another manner :-</p>
<ol start="62">
<li>The number of terms (in the series) as diminished by <em>one</em> and (then) multiplied by the common difference is combined with twice the first term in the series; and when this (combined sum) is multiplied by the number of terms (in the series) and is (then) divided by <em>two,</em> it becomes the sum of the series in all eases.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>61</strong>. This rulecomes out thus when expressed algebraically:-<br>
$\left( \frac{n~ - ~1}{2}b~ + ~a \right)~n~ = ~S$, where <em>a</em> is the first term, <em>b</em> the common difference, <em>n</em> the number of terms, and <em>S</em> the sum of the whole series.</p>
<p><strong>62</strong>. Similarly,$\frac{\left\{ ~(n~ - ~1)~b~ + ~2a \right\}~n}{2}~ = ~S$.</p>
<p>Tho rule for finding out the <em>ādidhana</em>, the <em>uttaradhana</em> and the <em>sarvadhana</em> :</p>
<ol start="63">
<li>The <em>ādidhana</em> is the first term multiplied by the number of terms (in the series). The <em>uttaradhana</em> is (the product of) the number of terms multiplied by the common difference (and again) multiplied by the half of the number of terms less by <em>one</em>. The sum of these two (gives) the <em>sarvadhana</em>, i.e., the sum of all the terms in the series; and (this sum will be the same as that of a series which is) characterised by a negative common difference, when (the order of the terms in the series is reversed so that) the last term is made to be the first term.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for finding the <em>antyadhana</em>, the <em>madhyadhana</em> and the <em>sarvadhana</em> :</p>
<ol start="64">
<li>The number of terms (in the series) lessened by <em>one</em> and multiplied by the common differenceand (then) combined with the first term (gives) the <em>antyadhana</em>.

</ol>
<p>63-64. In these rules, each of the terms in an arithmetically progressive series is supposed to be obtainedby adding to the first term thereof a multiple of the common difference, the nature of this multiple being determined by the position which any specified term holds in the series. According to this conception we have to find in every term of the series the first term along with a multiple of the commondifference. The sum of all such first terms so found is what is here called the <em>ādidhana</em>; the sum of all such multiples of the common difference constitutes the <em>uttaradhana</em>; and the <em>sarvadhana</em> which is obtained by adding these two sumsis of course the sum of the whole series. The expression <em>antyadhana</em> denotes the value of the last term in an arithmetically progressive series. And <em>madhyadhana</em> means the value of the middle term which value, however, corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the first and the last terms in the series, so that when there are 2n + 1 terms in the series, the value of the (n+ 1)th term is the <em>madhyadhana</em>, but when there are 2n terms in the series the arithmetical mean of the value of the nth term and of that of the (n + 1)th term becomes the <em>madhyadhana</em>. Accordingly we have</p>
<p>(1)Ādidhana = <em>n</em>×<em>a</em>.</p>
<p>(2) Uttaradhana = $\frac{(n~ - ~1)}{2}~ \times ~n~ \times ~b$.</p>
<p>(3) Antyodhana = (<em>n</em>−1)×<em>b</em>+<em>a</em>.</p>
<p>(4) Madhyadhana = $\frac{\left\{ ~(n~ - ~1)~b~ + ~a \right\}~ + ~a}{2}$.</p>
<p>(5) Sarvadhana = $(1)~ + ~(2)~ = ~(n~ \times ~a)~ + ~\left( \frac{n~ - ~1}{2}~ \times ~n~ \times ~b \right)$;</p>
<p>or = $(4)~ \times ~n~ = ~n~ \times ~\frac{\left\{ ~(n~ - ~1)~b~ + ~a \right\}~ + ~a}{2}$</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that an arithmetically progresive series having a negative common difference becomes changedinto one with a positive common difference when the order of the terms is reversed throughout so as to make the last of them become the first.</p>

It is used here to denote the quantity which may be obtained by adding the first term or the common difference or the number of terms or all three of these to the sum of a series in arithmetical progression. There are accordingly four different kinds of miśradhana mentioned here, and they are respectively ādi-miśradhana, uttara-miśradhana, gaccha-miśradhana and sarva-miśradhana. For ādidhana and uttaradhana see note under stanzas 63 and 64 in this chapter. Algebraically, stanza 80 works out thus:$a~ = ~\frac{\frac{n~(n~ - ~1)}{2}b}{n~ = ~1}$, where Sa is the ādi-miśradhana, i.e., S + a, And stanza 81 gives $b~ = ~\frac{\frac{Sb~ - ~na}{n~(n~ - ~1)}}{2}~ + ~1$ where Sb is the uttera-miśradhana, i.e., S + b : and further points out that the value of n may be found out when the value of Sn, which, being the gaccha-miśradhana, is equal to S + n, is given, from the fact that, when S = a + (a + b) + (a + 2b) + &hellip;&hellip; up to<em>n</em>terms, Sn = (a + 1) + (a + 1 + b) (a + 1 + 2b) + &hellip;.. up tothe same n terms.Since, stanza 82, the choice of <em>a</em> and <em>n</em> are left to our option, the problem of finding out <em>a, n</em>, and <em>b</em> from the given value of <em>S</em> <em>a n b</em>, which, being the sarva-miśradhana, is equal to <em>S + a + n + b</em>, resolves itself easily to the finding out of <em>b</em> from any given value of <em>Sb</em> in the manner above explained.</p>

<p>The rule for finding out the <em>guṇadhana</em> and the sum of a series in geometrical progression :-</p>
<ol start="93">
<li>The first term (of a series in geometrical progression), when multiplied by that self-multiplied product of the common ratio in which (product the frequency of the occurrence of the common ratio is) measured by the number of terms (in the series), gives rise to the <em>guṇadhana</em>. And it has to be understood that this <em>guṇadhana</em>, when diminished by the first term, and (then) divided by the common ratio lessened by <em>one</em>, becomes the sum of the series in geometrical progression.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another rule also for finding out the sum of a series in geometrical progression :-</p>
<ol start="94">
<li>The number of terms in the series is caused to be marked (in a separate column) by <em>zero</em> and by <em>one</em> (respectively) corresponding to the even (value) which is halved and to the uneven (value from which <em>one</em> is subtracted till by continuing these processos <em>zero</em> is ultimately reached); then this (representative series made up of <em>zero</em> and <em>one</em> is used in order from the last <em>one</em> therein, so that this <em>one</em> multiplied by the common ratio is again) multiplied by the common ratio (wherever one happens to be the denoting item), and multiplied so as to obtain the square (where-ever<em>zero</em> happens to be the denoting item). When (the resultof) this (operation) is diminished by <em>one</em>, and (is then) multiplied by the first term, and (is then) divided by the common ratio lessened by <em>one</em>, it becomes the sum (of the series).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>93</strong>. The <em>guṇadhana</em> of a series of <em>n</em> terms in geometrical progression corresponds in value to the (n + 1)th term thereof, when the series is continued. The value of this <em>guṇadhana</em> algebraically stated is r x r x r&hellip;.. up to <em>n</em> suchfactors x a, i.e., <em>ar^(u)</em>. Compare this with the <em>uttaradhana</em>.</p>
<p>This rule for finding out the sum may be algebraically expressed thus:-</p>
<p>$S~ = ~\frac{ar^{n}~ - ~a}{r~ - ~1}$, where <em>a</em> is the first term, <em>r</em> the common ratio, and <em>n</em> the number of terms.</p>
<p><strong>94</strong>. This rule differs from the previous one in so far as it gives a new method for finding out <em>r</em>^(<em>n</em>)by using the processes of squaring and ordinary multiplication; and this method will become clear from the following example:-</p>
<p>Let <em>n</em> in <em>r^(n)</em> be equal to 12.</p>
<p>12is even ; it has therefore to be divided by 2, and to be denoted by 0:</p>
<p>$\frac{12}{2}$= 6 is even;it has therefore to be divided by 2, and to be denoted by 0:<br>
$\frac{6}{2}$ = 3 is odd; I is to be subtracted from it, and it is denoted by 1:<br>
1 -3 = 2 is even; it has to be divided by 2, and to be denoted by 0:<br>
$\frac{2}{2}$ = 1 is odd; 1 is to be subtracted from it, and it is denoted by 1:<br>
1 - 1=0, which concludes this part of the operation.</p>
<p>Now, in the representative column of figures so derived and given in the margin -</p>
<p>0 the lowest 1 is multiplied by <em>r</em> , which gives <em>r</em> : since this lowest 1 has0</p>
<p>0 above it, the <em>r</em> obtained as before is squared, which gives <em>r²</em> : since this 0</p>
<p>1 has 1 above it, the <em>r²</em>now obtained is multiplied by <em>r</em>, which gives <em>r³</em> :</p>
<p>0 since this 1 has 0 above it, this <em>r³</em> is squared, which gives <em>r⁶</em>: and since</p>
<p>1 again this 0has another 0 above it, this<em>r⁶</em> is squared, which gives <em>r¹².</em></p>
<p>Thus the value of <em>r</em> may be arrived at by using as few times as possible the processes of squaring and simple multiplication. The object of the method is to facilitate the determination of the value of <em>r^(n)</em>, and it is easily seen that the method holds true for all positive and integral values of <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>The rulefor finding out the last term in ageometrically progressive series as also the sum of that (series):-</p>
<ol start="95">
<li>The <em>antyadhana</em> or the last term of a series in geometrical progression is the <em>guṇadhana</em> (of another series) wherein the number of terms is less by <em>one</em>. This (<em>antyadhana</em>), when multiplied by the common ratio, and (then) diminished by the first term, and (then) divided by the common ratio lessened by <em>one</em>, gives rise to the sum (of the series).</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>95</strong>. Expressed algebraically, $S~ = ~\frac{ar^{n}~ - ~1~ \times ~r~ - ~a}{r~ - ~1}$. The <em>antyadhana</em> is the value of the last term in a series in geometrical progression; for the meaning and value of <em>guṇadhana</em>, see stanza 93 above in this chapter. The <em>antyadhana</em> of a geometrically progressive series of <em>n</em>terms is <em>ar^(n-1)</em>, while the<em>guṇadhana</em>of the same series is <em>ar^(n)</em>. Similarly the <em>antyadhana</em> of a geometrically progressive series of n - 1terms is <em>ar^(n-2)</em>, while the <em>guṇadhana</em> thereof is <em>ar^(n-1)</em>. Here it is evident that the <em>antyadhana</em> of the series of n terms is the same as the <em>guṇadhana</em> of the series of n - 1 terms.</p>
<p>The rule for finding out the first term and the common ratio in relation to a (given) <em>guṇadhana</em> :</p>
<ol start="97">
<li>The <em>guṇadhana</em> when divided by the first term becomes equal to the (self-multiplied) product of a certain quantity in which (product) that (quantity) occurs as often as the number of terms (in the series); and this (quantity) is the (required) common ratio. The <em>guṇadhana</em>, when divided by that (self-multiplied) product of the common ratio in which (product the frequency of the occurrence of this common ratio) is measured by the number of terms (in the series), gives rise to the first term.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for finding out in relation to a given <em>guṇadhana</em> the number of terms (in the corresponding geometrically progressive series) :-</p>
<ol start="98">
<li>Divide the <em>guṇadhana</em> (of the series) by the first term (thereof).

It is clear that ar^(n), when divided by a gives r^(n)and this is divisible by r as many times as n , which is accordingly the measure of the number of terms in the series. Similarly r x r x r &hellip;&hellip; up to n times gives r^(n) and the<em>guṇadhana</em>i.e., ar^(n)divided by this r^(n)gives a, which is the required first term of the series.</p>

<li>That (quantity) by which the sum of the series divided by the first term and (then) lessened by <em>one</em> is divisible throughout (when this process of division after the subtraction of <em>one</em> is carried on in relation to all the successive quotients) time after time - (that quantity) is the common ratio. The sum, multiplied by thecommon ratio lessened by <em>one</em>, and (then) divided by that self-multiplied product of the common ratio in which (product) that (common ratio) occurs as frequently as the number of terms (in the series), after this (same self-multiplied product of the common ratio) is diminished by <em>one</em>, gives rise to the first term.</li>

<li>When the first term is 3 , the number of terms is 6, and the sum is 4095 (in relation to a series in geometrical progression), what is the value of the common ratio ? The common ratio is 6, the number of terms is 5, and the sum is 3110 (in relation to another series in geometrical progression). What is the first term here?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>101</strong>. The first part of the rule will become clear from the following example:-<br>
The sum of the series is 4095, the first term 3, and the number of terms 6.<br>
Here, dividing 4095 by 3 we get 1365. Now, 1365 - 1 = 1364. Choosing by trial 4, we have $\frac{1364}{4}$ = 341; 341 - 1 = 340; $\frac{340}{4}$ = 85; 85 - 1 =84; $\frac{84}{4}$ =21; 21 - 1 = 20; $\frac{20}{4}$ = 5; 5 - 1 = 4; $\frac{4}{4}$ = 1. Hence 4 is the common ratio. The principle on which this method is based will be clear from the following:-<br>
$\frac{a~\left( r^{n}~ - ~1 \right)}{r~ - ~1}~ \div ~a~ = ~\frac{r^{n}~ - ~1}{r~ - ~1};~and~\frac{r^{n}~ - ~1}{r~ - ~1} - ~1~ = ~\frac{r^{n}~ - ~r}{r~ - ~1}$which is obviously divisible by r.<br>
The second part expressed algebraically is
$a~ = ~\frac{a~\left( r^{n}~ - ~1 \right)}{r~ - ~1}~ \times ~\frac{r~ - ~1}{r^{n}~ - ~1}$.</p>

<p>The rule of work here, in relation to the multiplication of fractions, is as follows:-</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the multiplication of fractions, the numerators are to be multiplied by the numerators and the denominators by the denominators, after carrying out the process of cross-reduction, if that be possible in relation to them.</li>

<p><strong>Simple fractions : (addition and subtraction).</strong></p>
<p>The rule of operation in connection with simple fractions therein :-</p>
<ol start="55">
<li>If, in the operations relating to simple fractions, the numerator and the denominator (of each of two given simple fractions) are multiplied in alternation by the quotients obtainedby dividing the denominators by means of a common factor thereof, (the quotient derived from the denominator of either of the fractions being used in the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator of the other fraction), those (fractions) become so reduced as to have equal denominators. (Then) removing one of these (equal) denominators, the numerators are to be added (to one another) or to be subtracted(from one another, so that the result may be the numerator in relation to the other equal denominator).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>55</strong>. The method of reducing fractions to common denominators described in this rule applies only to pairs of fractions. The rule will be clear from the following worked out example : to simplify $\frac{a}{xy}~ + ~\frac{b}{yz}$. Here, <em>a</em> and <em>xy</em> are to be multiplied by <em>z</em> which is the quotient obtained by dividing <em>yz</em>, the denominator of the other fraction, by <em>y</em> which is the common factor of the denominators. Thus we get $\frac{az}{xyz}$. Similarly, in the second fraction, by multipliying <em>b</em> and <em>yz</em> by <em>x</em> which is the quotient obtained by dividing the first denominator <em>xy</em> by <em>y</em> the common factor, we get $\frac{bx}{xyz}$. Now, $\frac{az}{xyz}~ + ~\frac{bx}{xyz}~ = ~\frac{az~ + ~bx}{xyz}$.</p>

<p>Here, the rule for arriving at the numerators, (when the denominators and the sum of a number of fractions are given, is as follows) :-</p>
<ol start="72">
<li>Make <em>one</em> the numerater (in relation to all the given denominators); then, multiply by means of such (numbers) as are optionally choson, those numerators which (are derived from these fractions so as to) have a common denominator. (Here), these(numbers) turn out to be the required numerators, the sum of the products whereof, obtained by multiplying them with the numerators (derived as above), is equal to (the numerator of) the given sum (of the fractions concerned).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therule for arriving at the numerators, (the denominators and the sum being given as before), in relation to such (fractional) quantities as have their numerators (successively) rising in value by <em>one</em>, when, in the (given) sum (of these fractions), the denominator is higher in value than the numerator : -</p>
<ol start="73">
<li>The quotient obtained by dividing the (given) sum (of the fractions concorned) by the sum of those (tentative fractions)which, (while having the given denominators), have <em>one</em> for the numerators and (are then reduced so as to) have a common denominator, becomes the (first required) numerator among those which (successively) rise in value by <em>one</em>(and are to be found out). On the remainder (obtained in this division) being divided by the sum of the other numerators (having the common denominator as above), it,(i.e., the resulting quotient), becomes another (viz., thesecond required)numerator (if addedto the first one already obtained). In this manner the problem has to be worked out) to the end.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>72</strong>. This rule will become clear from the working of the example in stanza No. 74, wherein we assume 1 to be the provisional numerator in relation to each of the given denominators; thus we get $\frac{1}{9},~\frac{1}{10}$ and $\frac{1}{11}$ which, being reduced so as to have a common denominator, become $\frac{110}{990},~\frac{99}{990}$and $\frac{90}{990}$. When the numerators are multiplied by 2, 3 und 4 in order, the sum of the products thus obtained becomes equal to the numerator of the given sum, namely, 877. Hence, 2, 3, and 4 are the required numerators. Here it may be pointed out that this given sum also must be understood to have the same denominator as the common denominator of the fractions.</p>
<p><strong>73</strong>. To work out the sum given ander 74 below, according to this rule :- Reducing to the same denominator the fractions formed by assuming 1 to be the numerator in relation to each of the given denominators, we get $\frac{110}{990},~\frac{99}{990}$ and $\frac{90}{990}$. Dividing the giren sum $\frac{877}{990}$ by the sum of these fractions $\frac{299}{990}$, we get the quotient 2, which is the numerator in relation to the first denominator. The remainder 279 obtained in this division is then divided by the sum of the remaining provisional numerators, i.e., 189, giving the quotient 1, which, combined with the numerator of the first fraction, namely 2, becomes the numerater in relation to the second denominator. The remainder in this second division, viz, 90, is divided by the provisional numerator 90 of the last fraction, and the quotient 1, when combined with the numerator of the previous fraction, namely 3, gives rise to the numerator in relation to the last denominator. Hence the fractions, of which $\frac{877}{990}$ is the sum, are $\frac{2}{9},~\frac{3}{10}$ and $\frac{4}{11}$. It is noticeable here that the numerator&rsquo;s successively found out thus become the required numerators in relation to the given denominators in the order in which they are given. Algebraically also, given the denominators <em>a, b &amp; c</em>, in respect of 3 fractions whose sum is $\frac{bcx~ + ~(x~ + ~1)~ac~ + ~(x~ + ~2)~ab}{abc}$, the numerators <em>x, x</em> + 1 and <em>x</em> + 2 are easily found out by the method as given above.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="74">
<li>The sum of (certain) numbers which are divided (respectively) by 9, 10 and 11 is 877 as divided by 990. Give out what the numerators are (in this operation of adding fractions).</li>

<p>The rule for arriving at the (required) denominators (is as follows) :-</p>
<ol start="75">
<li>When the sum of the (different fractional) quantities having <em>one</em> for their numerators is <em>one</em>, the (required) denominators are such as, beginning with <em>one</em>, are in order multiplied (successively) by<em>three</em>, the first and the last (denominators so obtained) being (however) multiplied (again) by 2 and $\frac{2}{3}$ (respectively).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>75</strong>. In working out an example according to the method statedherein, it will be found that when there are <em>n</em>fractions, there are, after leaving out the first andthe last fractions, n:- 2 terms in
geometrical progressionwith $\frac{1}{3}$ as the first term and $\frac{1}{3}$ as the common ratio. The sum of these n - 2 terms is $\frac{\frac{1}{3}~\left\{ ~1~ - ~\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)~a~ - ~2 \right\}}{1~ - ~\frac{1}{3}}$,which we reduced becomes $\frac{1}{2}~ - ~\frac{1}{2}~\frac{1}{3n~ - ~2}$, which is the sameas $\frac{1}{2}~ - ~\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}}~ \times \frac{1}{3n~ - ~1}$. From this it is clear that, when the first fraction $\frac{1}{2}$and the last fraction $\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}~3n~ - ~1}$ are added to this last result, the sum becomes 1. In this connection it may be noted that, in a series in geometrical progression consisting of <em>n</em> terms, having $\frac{1}{a}$ as the first term and $\frac{1}{a}$ as the common ratio, the sum is, for all positiveintegral values of <em>a</em>, less than$\frac{1}{a~ - ~1}$ by $\frac{1}{\frac{a~ - ~1}{a}}~ \times$ the (n + 1)th term in the series. Therefore, if we add to the sum of the series in geometrien progression $\frac{1}{\frac{a~ - ~1}{a}}~ \times$ the (n + 1)th term, which is the last fraction according to the rule stated in this stanza, we get $\frac{1}{a~ - ~1}$. To this $\frac{1}{~a~ - ~1}$, we have to add $\frac{a~ - ~2}{a~ - ~1}$ in order to get 1 as the sum. This$\frac{a~ - ~2}{a~ - ~1}$ is mentioned in the rule as the first fraction, and so 3 is the value chosen for <em>a</em>, since the numerator of all the fractions has to be 1.</p>

It is meant here that $\frac{1}{6}$ of $\frac{2}{5}$ is to be subtracted from $\frac{2}{5}$ in the first example;and the second example comes to $\frac{6}{7}~ - ~\frac{1}{6}$ of $\frac{6}{7}~ - ~\frac{1}{8}$ of ($\frac{6}{7}~ - ~\frac{1}{6}$of $\frac{6}{7}$) - $\frac{1}{9}$ of {$\frac{6}{7}~ - ~\frac{1}{6}$of $\frac{6}{7}~ - ~\frac{1}{8}$of ($\frac{6}{7}~ - ~\frac{1}{6}$ of $\frac{6}{7}$) }.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS (ON FRACTIONS).</p>
<p><strong>The Third Subject of Treatment.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After saluting the Lord Jina, Mahāvīra, whose collection of infinite attributes is highly praiseworthy, and who vouchsafes boons to (all) the three worlds that worship (him), I shall treat of miscellaneous problems (on fractions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May Jina, who has destroyed the darkness of unrighteousness, and is the authoritative exponent of the <em>syādvāda</em>, and is the joy of learning, and is the great disputant and the best of sages, be (ever) victorious. Hereafter we shall expound the third subject of treatment, viz., miscellaneous problems (on fractions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are these ten (varieties in miscellaneous problems on fractions, namely), <em>Bhāga</em>, <em>Śeṣa</em>, <em>Mūla</em>, <em>Śeṣamūla</em>, the two varieties<em>Dviragraśeṣamūla</em>and <em>Aṁśamūla</em>, and then <em>Bhāgabẖyāsa</em>, then <em>Aṁśararga</em>, <em>Mūlamiśra</em> and <em>Bhinnadṛśya</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3</strong>. The Bh<em>ā</em>ga variety consists of problems wherein is given the numerical value of the portion remaining after removing certain specified fractional parts of the total quantity to be found out. The fractional partsremoved are each of them called a <em>bhāga</em>, and the numerical value of the known remainder is termed<em>dṛśya</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Śeṣa</em>variety consists of problems wherein the numerical value is given of the portion remaining after removing a known fractional part of the total quantity to be found out as also after removing certain known fractional parts of the successive śeṣas or remainders.</p>
<p>The <em>Mūla</em>variety consists of problems wherein the numerical value is given of the portion remaining after subtracting from the total quantity certain fractional parts thereof as also a multiple of the square root of that total quantity.</p>
<p>The <em>śeṣamūla</em> variety is the same as the <em>mūla</em> variety with this difference, viz., the square root here is of the remainder after subtracting the given fractional parts, instead of being of the whole.</p>
<p>The <em>Dviragraśeṣamūla</em> variety consists of problems wherein a known number of things is first removed, then some fractional parts of the successive remainders and then some multiple of the square root of the further remainder are removed, and lastly the numerical value of the remaining portion is given. The known number first removed is called <em>pūrvāgra</em>.</p>
<p>In the <em>Aṁśamūla</em> variety, a multiple of the square root of a fractional part of the total number is supposed to be first removed, and then the numerical value of the remaining portion is given.</p>
<p>In the <em>Bhāgābhyāsa</em> sa or <em>Bhāgasaṃvarga</em> variety, the numerical value is given of the portion remaining after removing from the whole the product or products of certain fractional parts of the whole taken two by two.</p>
<p>The <em>Aṃśavarga</em> variety consists of problems wherein the numerical value is given of the remainder after removing from the whole the square of a fractional part thereof, this fractional part being at the same time increased or decreased by a given number.</p>
<p>The <em>Mūlamiśra</em> variety consists of problems wherein is given the numerical value of the sum of the square root of the whole when added to the square root of the whole as increased or diminished by a given number of things.</p>
<p>In the <em>Bhinnadṛśya</em> variety, a fractional part of the whole as multiplied by another fractional part thereof is removed from it, and the remaining portion is expressed as a fraction of the whole. Here it will be seen that unlike in the other varieties the numerical value of the last remaining portion is not actually given, but is expressed as a fraction of the whole.</p>
<p>The rule relating to the <em>Bhāga</em> and the <em>Śeṣa</em> varieties therein, (i.e., in miscellaneous problems on fractions).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the operation relating to the <em>Bhāga</em> variety, the (required) result is obtained by dividing the given quantity by <em>one</em> as diminished by the (known) fractions. In the operation relating to the <em>śeṣa</em> variety, (the required result) is the given quantity divided by the product of (the quantities obtained respectively by) subtracting the (known) fractions from one.</li>

<p><strong>4</strong>. Algebraically, the rulerelating to the <em>Bhāga</em> variety is$x~ = ~\frac{a}{1~ - ~b}$, where <em>x</em> is the unknown collective quantity to be found out, <em>a</em> isthe <em>dṛśya</em> or <em>agra</em>, and <em>b</em> is the <em>bhāga</em> or the fractional part or the sum of the fractional parts given.<br>
It is obvious that this is derivable from the equation <em>x</em> - <em>bx</em> = <em>a</em>. The rule relating to the Śēṣa variety, when algebraically expressed, comes to $x~ = ~\frac{a}{\left( 1~ - ~b_{1} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{2} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{3} \right)~ \times ~\&amp; c}$. Where <em>b₁</em>, <em>b₂</em>, <em>b₃</em>, &amp;c, are fractional parts of the successive reminders. This formula also is derivable from the equation <em>x</em>−<em>b</em>₁<em>x</em>−<em>b</em>₂(<em>x</em>−<em>b</em>₁<em>x</em>)−<em>b</em>₃{<em>x</em>−<em>b</em>₁<em>x</em>−<em>b</em>₂(<em>x</em>−<em>b</em>₁<em>x</em>)}−&amp;<em>c</em>=<em>a</em>.</p>

<p>The rule relating to the <em>Ś**eṣamūla</em> variety involving two known (quantities constituting the) remainders:-</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>
<p>The (coefficient of the) square root (of the unknown collective quantity), and the (final) quantity known (to remain), should (both) be divided by the product of the fractional (proportional) quantities, as subtracted from <em>one</em> (in each case); then the first known quantity should be added to the (other) known quantity (treated as above). Thereafter the operation relating to the <em>Śeṣamūla</em> variety (of miscellaneous problems on fractions is to be adopted).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Algebraically, this rule enables us to arrive at the expressions $\frac{c}{\left( 1~ - ~b_{1} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{2} \right)~ \times ~\&amp; c}$ and $\frac{a_{2}}{\left( 1~ - ~b_{1} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{2} \right)~ \times ~\&amp; c}~ + ~a_{1}$,which are required to be substituted for <em>c</em> and <em>a</em> respectively in the formula for<em>Śeṣamūla,</em> which is $x~ - ~bx~ = ~\left\{ ~\frac{c}{2}~ + ~\sqrt{\left( \frac{c}{2} \right)^{2}~ + ~a}~ \right\}^{2}$.In applying this formula the value of<em>b</em> becomes zero, as the <em>mūla</em>or suare root involved in the <em>dviragra-śeṣamūla</em>is that of the total collective quantity and not of a fractional part of that quantity. Substitating as desired, we get $x~ = ~\left\{ ~\frac{c}{2~\left( 1~ - ~b_{1} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{2} \right)~ \times ~\&amp; c}~ + ~\sqrt{\left( \frac{c}{2~\left( 1~ - ~b_{1} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{2} \right)~ \times ~\&amp; c} \right)^{2}~ + ~\frac{a_{2}}{\left( 1~ - ~b_{1} \right)~\left( 1~ - ~b_{2} \right)~ \times ~\&amp; c}~ + ~a_{1}}~ \right\}^{2}$. This result may easily be obtained from the equation $x~ - ~a_{1}~ - ~b_{1}~\left( x~ - ~a_{1} \right)~ - ~b_{2}~\left\{ x~ - ~a_{1}~ - ~b_{1}~\left( x~ - ~a_{1} \right)~ \right\}~ - ~&hellip;~ - ~c~\sqrt{x~ - ~a_{2}}~ = ~0$,where <em>b₁, b₂</em>, <em>&amp;c</em>., arethe various fractional parts of the successive remainders; and <em>a₁</em>and <em>a₂</em>are the first known quantity and the final known quantity respectively.</p>

For attaining the supreme good, we worshipfully salute the holy Jinas, who are in possession of the fourfold infinite attributes, who are the makers of <em>tīrthas</em>, who have attained self-conquest, are pure, are honoured in all the three worlds and are also excellent preceptors -the Jinas who have gone over to the (other) shore of the ocean of the Jaina doctrines, and are the guides and teachers of (all) born beings, and who, being the abode of all good qualities, are good in themselves and do good to others.</p>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound the fifth subject of treatment known as mixed problems. It is as follows:-</p>
<p>Statement of the meaning of the technical terms <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>and <em>viṣama-saṅkramaṇa</em>:-</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Those who have gone to the end of the ocean of calculation say that the halving of the sum and of the difference (of any two quantities) is (known as) <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>, and that the <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>of two quantities which are (respectively) the divisor and the quotient is that which is <em>viṣama</em>(i.e., <em>viṣama-saṅkramaṇa</em>).</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Algebraically the <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>of any two quantities a and b is finding<br>
out $\frac{(a~ + ~b)}{2}$ and $\frac{(a~ - ~b)}{2}$;their <em>viṣama-saṅkramaṇa</em> is arriving at $\frac{b~ + ~\frac{a}{b}}{2}$and $\frac{\left. b~ \right.\sim~\frac{a}{b}}{2}$.</p>

<p><strong>Double Rule-of-three.</strong></p>
<p>The rule for arriving at (the value of) the interest which (operation) is of the nature of double rule-of-three :-</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The number representing the <em>Icchā</em>, i.e., the amount the interest whereon is desired to be found out, is multiplied by the time connected with itself and is then multiplied by (the number representing) the (given) rate of interest for the given capital; (then the resulting product) is divided by the time and the capital quantity (connected with the rate of interest); this (quotient) is,in arithmetic, the interest of the desired amount.</li>

The capital quantity (involved in the rate of interest) is multiplied by the time connected with itself and is then dividedby the interest connected with itself. (Then) this (quotient) has to be divided by the time connected with the capital lent out; (this last) quotient when multiplied by the interest (that has accrued) becomes the capital giving rise to that (interest).</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. Symbolically $i~ = ~\frac{c~ \times ~t~ \times ~I}{T~ \times ~C}$,where <em>T, C</em> and <em>I</em> are respectively the time, capital and interest of the <em>pramāṇa</em> or the rate and <em>t, c</em> and <em>i</em> are respectively the time, capital and interest of the <em>Icchā</em>. For an explanation of <em>pramāṇa</em>, <em>Icchā</em>, &amp;c., see note under Ch. V. 2.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>$\frac{C~ \times ~T~ \times ~i}{I~ \times ~t}~ = ~c$.Symbolically (C x T x i) / (I x t) = c.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The interest on 70 for 1$\frac{1}{2}$ months is exactly 2$\frac{1}{2}$. When the interest is 2$\frac{1}{2}$for 7$\frac{1}{2}$ months what is the capital lent out?</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for finding out the time (during which interest has accrued) :-</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Take the capital amount (involved in the given rate of interest) as multiplied by the time (connected therewith); then cause this to be divided by its own (connected) rate-interest and by the capital lent out; then this (quotient) here is multiplied by the interest that has accrued on the capital lent out. Wise men say that the resulting (product) is the time (for which the interest has accrued)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="15">

<p><strong>14</strong>. Symbolically, $\frac{C~ \times ~T~ \times ~i}{I~ \times ~c}~ = ~t$.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>It is 96 that is lent out at the rate of 6 per cent (per mensem); the interest thereon is seen to be 57$\frac{3}{5}$. What is the time (for which interest has accrued) ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule regarding barter or exchange of commodities :-</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>The quantity of the commodity taken in exchange is divided by its own price as well as by the quantity of the commodity given in exchange. (It is then) multiplied by the price of the commodity given in exchange, and thereafter multiplied by the quantity of the commodity intended to be exchanged. This (resulting) product is the required quantity corresponding to the prices of the commodity given in exchange as well as of the commodity taken in exchange.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>19 and 20. <em>Palas</em> 8 of dried ginger were purchased for 6$\frac{1}{4}$ <em>paṇas</em> and <em>palas</em> 5 of long pepper for 8$\frac{3}{4}$ <em>paṇas</em>. Think out and tell me quickly, O you who know arithmetic, how many <em>palas</em> of long pepper have been purchased by one (at the above rate) by means of 80 <em>palas</em> of dried ginger.</p>
<p>Thus end the problems on double rule-of-three in this chapter on mixed problems.</p>
<p><strong>Problems bearing on interest.</strong></p>
<p>Next, in the chapter on mixed problems, we shall expound problems bearing on interest.</p>
<p>The rule for the separation of the capital and interest from their mixed sum :-</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>The result arrived at by carrying out the operation of division in relation to the given mixed sum of capital and interestby means of <em>one</em>, to which the interest thereon for the (given) time is added, (happens to be the required) capital; and the interest required is the combined sum <em>minus</em> this capital.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>21</strong>. Symbolically, c = m / [ 1 + (1 x t x I) / T x C)], where m = c + i; hence i = m - c.</p>
<p><em>An example inillustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="22">
<li>If one lends out money at the rate of 5 per cent (per month), the combined sum of interest and capital becomes 48 in 12 months. What are the capital and the interest therein ?</li>
</ol>
<p>Again another rule for the separation of the capital and the interest from their combined sum :-</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>The product of the given, time and the rate-interest, divided by the rate-time and the rate-capital and then combined with <em>one</em>, is the divisor of the combined sum of the capital and interest; the resulting quotient has to be understood as the (required) capital.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Having given out on interest some money at the rate of 2$\frac{1}{2}$per cent (per mensem), one obtains 33 in 4 months as the combined sum (of the capital and the interest). What may be the capital (therein)?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for the separation of the time and the interest from their combined sum :-</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Take the rate-capital multiplied by the rate-time and divided by the rate-interest and by the given capital, and then combine this (resulting quantity) with <em>one</em>; then the quotient obtained by dividing the combined sum (of the time and interest) by this (resulting sum) indeed becomes the (required) interest.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Money amounting to 60 exactly was lent out at the rate of 5 per cent (per month) by one desirous of obtaining interest.The time (for which the interest has accrued) combined with the interest therefor is 20. What is the time here?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>23</strong>. Symbolically $c~ = ~m~ \div ~\left\{ \frac{t~ \times ~I}{T~ \times ~C} \right\}$. It is evident that this is very much the same as the formula given under 21.</p>
<p><strong>25</strong>. Symbolically $i~ = ~m~ \div ~\left\{ \frac{C~ \times ~T}{I~ \times ~c}~ + ~1 \right\}~ = ~i$, where <em>m</em>=<em>i</em>+<em>t</em>.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>
<p>The capital put to interest at the rate of 1$\frac{1}{2}$ per 70$\frac{1}{2}$ (per mensem) is 705. The mixed sum of its time and interest is 80. (What is the value of the time and of the interest ?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The capital put to interest at the rate of 3$\frac{1}{2}$per 80 for 2$\frac{1}{2}$months is 400, and the mixed sum of time and interest is 36. (What is the time and what the interest ?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the separation of the capital and the time of interest from their mixed sum :-</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>From the square of the given mixed sum (of the capital and the time), the rate-capital divided by its rate-interest and multiplied by the rate-time and by four times the given interest is to be subtracted. The square root of this (resulting remainder) is then used in relation to the given mixed sum so as to carry out the process of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="30">
<li>
<p>This, viz., 4 <em>purāṇas</em> is the interest on 70 (per month). The interest (obtained on the whole) is 25. The mixed sum (of the capital used and the time of interest) is 45$\frac{1}{4}$. What is the capital lent out?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By lending out what capital for what time at the rate of 3 per 60 (per mensem) would a man obtain 18 as interest, 66 being the mixed sum of that time and that capital?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has been ascertained that the interest for 1$\frac{1}{2}$ months on 60 is only 2$\frac{1}{2}$. The interest here (in the given instance) is 24, and60 is (the value of) the time combined with the capital lent out. (What is the time and what the capital ?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>29</strong>. Symbolically.$\frac{\sqrt{m^{2}~ - ~\frac{C~ \times ~T}{I}~ \times ~4i~ \pm ~m}~}{2}~ = ~c$ or <em>t</em>as the case may be, where <em>m</em>=<em>c</em>+<em>t</em>.<br>
The value of the quantity under the root, as given in the rule, is(<em>c</em>−<em>t</em>)²; and the square root of this and the <em>miśra</em> have the operationof <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>performed in relation to them.<br>
For the explanation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>see Ch. VI. 2.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the separation of the rate-interest and the required time from their sum :-</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>The rate-capital is multiplied by its own rate-time, by the given interest and by four, and is then divided by the other (that is, the given) capital. The square root of the remainder (obtained by subtracting this resulting quotient) from the square of the given mixed sum is then used in relation to the mixed sum so as to carry out the process of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="34">
<li>The mixed sum of the rate-interest and of the time (for which interest has accrued) at the rate of the quantity to be found out per 100 per month and a half is 12$\frac{1}{2}$, the capital lent out being 30 and the interest accruing thereon being 5. (What is the rate of interest and what the time for which it has accrued ?)</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving separately at the capital, time, and the interest from their mixed sum :-</p>
<p>35<sup id="fnref:232"><a href="#fn:232" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">232</a></sup>. Any (optionally chosen) quantity subtracted from the given mixed sum may happen to be the time required. By means of the interest on <em>one</em> for that same time, to which interest <em>one</em> is added, (the quantity remaining after the optionally chosen time is subtracted from the given mised sum) is to be divided. (The resulting quotient) is the required capital. The mixed sum diminished by its own corresponding time and capital becomes the (required) interest.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="36">

He thusgave in discharge of the debt the sum of a series in arithmetical progression consisting of $\frac{80}{8}$ terms and gave also the interest accruing on those multiples of 8. The debt amount (corresponding to the sum of the series), the interest (which he paid), and the time of discharge (of that debt) - tell me, friend, after calculating, what the (respective) value of these quantities is.</p>
<p><strong>71</strong>. The rule is very elliptical and will become clear from the following working of the example contained in stanzas 72 - 73$\frac{1}{2}$:-<br>
Here the <em>mūla</em> or the maximum available amount of an instalment is 60 ;this, when divided by 7, the amount of the first instalment, gives $\frac{60}{7}$ or 8$\frac{4}{7}$, of which8 represents the number of terms of the series in arithmetical progressionwhich has 1 for the first term and 1 for the common differenceand $\frac{4}{7}$ is the <em>agra</em> or the outstanding fractional part. The sun of the above-mentionedseries, viz., 36, multiplied by 7, the amount of the first instalment, is added to the product of $\frac{4}{7}$ and 60, which latter is the maximum available amount of an instalment. Thus, weget $36~ \times ~7~ + ~\frac{4}{7}~ \times ~60~ = ~\frac{2004}{7}$, which is the required capital amount in the due debt. The interest on $\frac{2004}{7}$ for $\frac{3}{6}$ of a month at the rate of 5per cent per mensem will be the interest paid on the whole. The time of discharge will be $\left( \frac{3}{6}~ \div ~7 \right)~ \times ~20~ = ~\frac{36}{7}$months.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the average common interest :-</p>
<p>77 and 77$\frac{1}{2}$. Divide the sum of the (various accruing) interests by the sum of the (various corresponding) interests due for a month; the resulting quotient is the required time. The product of the (assumed) rate-time and the rate-capital is divided by this required time, then multiplied by the sum of the (various accruing) interests and then divided again by the sum of the (various given) capital amounts. This gives rise to the (required) rate-interest.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>

<p>Thus end the problems bearing on interest in this chapter on mixed problems.</p>
<p>77 and 77$\frac{1}{2}$. The various accruing interests are the various amounts of interestsaccruing on the several amounts at the various rates for their respective periods. Symbolically,</p>

<p><strong>Proportionate Division.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound in (this) chapter on mixed problems the working of proportionate division :-</p>
<p>79$\frac{1}{2}$. The operationof proportionate division is that wherein the (given) collective quantity (to be divided) is first divided by the sum of the numerators of the common-denominator-fractions (representing the various proportionate parts), the denominators of which fractions are struck off out of consideration; and (then it) has to be multiplied (respectively in each case) by (these) proportional numerators. This is called <em>kuṭṭīkāra</em> by the learned.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>80$\frac{1}{2}$.Here, (in this problem,) 120 gold pieces are divided among 4 servants in the (respective) proportional parts of $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{3},~\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{6}$. O arithmetician, tell me quickly what they obtained.</p>
<p>81$\frac{1}{2}$. (The sum of) 363 <em>dīnāras</em> was divided among five, the first one (among them) getting 3 parts, and 3 being the common ratio successively (in relation to the shares of the others). What was the share of each?</p>
<p>82$\frac{1}{2}$ to 85$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain faithful <em>śrāvaka</em> took a number of lotus flowers, and going into the Jina temple conducted (therein) with devotion the worship of the chief Jinas that were worthy of worship. He offered $\frac{1}{4}$ part to <em>Vṛṣabha</em>, $\frac{1}{6}$ to worthy <em>Pārśva</em>, and $\frac{1}{12}$ to Jinapati, and $\frac{1}{8}$ to sage Suvrata: he dovotedly gave $\frac{1}{8}$to Ariṣṭanemi who destroyed all the eight kinds of <em>karmas</em> and who was beloved by the world, and $\frac{1}{6}$ of $\frac{1}{4}$ to Jinaśānti : 480 lotuseswere brought (for this purpose.) By adopting the operation knownas <em>prakṣēpaka</em>, give out the proportionate distribution of the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>79$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>.In working the example in stanza 80$\frac{1}{2}$ according to this rule we get: $\frac{1}{2},~\frac{1}{3},~\frac{1}{4},~\frac{1}{6}~ = ~\frac{6}{12},~\frac{4}{12},~\frac{3}{12},~\frac{2}{12}$. after removing the denominators here, we have 6, 4, 3 and 2. These are also called <em>prakṣēpas</em>or proportional numerators. The sum of theseis 15, by which the amount to be distributed, viz, 120, is divided and the resulting quotient 8 is separately multiplied by the proportional numerators 6, 4, 3 and 2. Then the amounts thus obtained are 6 ×8 or 48, 4 × 8 or 32, 3 × 8 or 24, 2 × 8or 16. It is worthy of note that <em>prakṣēpa</em>means both the operation of proportionate division and a proportional numerator.</p>
<p>86$\frac{1}{2}$. (A sum of) 480 was divided among five men in the proportion of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ; 0 friend, give out (the share of each).</p>
<p>The rulefor arriving at (certain) results in required proportions -</p>
<p>87$\frac{1}{2}$. The (number representing the) rate-price is divided by (the number representing) the thing purchasable therewith: (it) is (then) multiplied by the (given) proportional number;by means of this, (we get at) the sum of the proportionate parts, (through) the process of addition. Then the given amount multiplied by the (respective) proportionate parts and then divided by (this sum of) the proportionate parts gives rise to the value (of the various things in the required proportion).</p>
<p>Another rule for this (same) purpose :-<br>
88$\frac{1}{2}$. Multiply the numbers representing the rate-prices (respectively) by the numbers representing the (given) proportions of the (various) things (to be purchased); then divide (the result) by the (respective) numbers measuring the things purchasable for the rate-price; the resulting quantities happen to be the (requisite) multipliers in the operation of <em>prakṣēpaka</em>. The intelligent man may (then) give out the required answer by adopting the rule-of-three.</p>
<p>Again a rule for this (same) purpose :-</p>
<p>89$\frac{1}{2}$. The (numbers representing the various) rate-prices are respectively divided by their own related (numbers representing the) things purchasable therefor and are (then) multiplied by their related proportional numbers. With the help of these, the remainder (of the operation should be carried out) as before.The required result is well arrived at by going through the process of the rule-of-three.</p>
<p><strong>87$\frac{1}{2}$to 89</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. In working the example in stanza 90$\frac{1}{2}$ and 91$\frac{1}{2}$ according to these rules 2, 3 and 5 are divided by 3, 5 and 7 respectively and are similarly multiplied by 6, 3 and 1. Thus we have $\frac{2}{3}~ \times ~6,~\frac{3}{5}~ \times ~3,~\frac{5}{7}~ \times ~1~ = ~4,~\frac{9}{5},~\frac{5}{7}$. These are the proportional parts. The rules in stanzas 88$\frac{1}{2}$ and 89$\frac{1}{2}$ require thereafter the operation of <em>prakṣēpa</em>to be applied in relation to these proportional parts ; but the rule in stanza 87$\frac{1}{2}$expressly describes this operation.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>90$\frac{1}{2}$ and 91$\frac{1}{2}$. Pomegranates, mangoes and woodapples are obtainable at the (respective) rates of 3 for 2, 5 for 3, and 7 for 5<em>paṇas</em>. Oyou friend, who know the principles of calculation, come quickly having purchased fruits for 76 <em>paṇas</em>, so that the mangoesmay be three times as the woodapples, and the pomogranates six times as much.</p>
<p>92$\frac{1}{2}$ to 94$\frac{1}{2}$. A follower of Jina had the image of Jina bathed in potfuls of curds, ghee and milk. Three pots became filled with 72<em>palas</em> (of these); 32 <em>palas</em> were found in the first pot and 24 in the second pot and 16 in the third pot. From these (potfuls of mixedup) curds, ghee and milk, find out each of those (ingredients) separately and give them out, there being altogether 24 <em>palas</em>of ghee, 16 <em>palas</em> of milk and 32 <em>palas</em> of curds.</p>
<p>95$\frac{1}{2}$ and 96$\frac{1}{2}$. Three <em>purāṇas</em> formed the pay of one man who is a mounted soldier; and at that rate there were 65 men in all. Some (among them) broke down, and the amount of their pay was given to those that remained in the field. Of this, each man obtained 10 <em>purāṇas</em>. You tell me, after thinking well, how many remained in the field and how many broke down.</p>
<p>The rule for the operation of proportionate division, wherein there is the addition or the subtraction of certain optionally chosen integral quantities :-</p>
<p>97$\frac{1}{2}$. The given total quantity is diminished by the integral quantities that are to be added, or is combined with the positiveintegral quantities that are to be subtracted; then with the help of this resulting quantity the operation of proportionate division is to be conducted, and the resulting proportionateparts are respectively combined with those (integral quantities that are to be added to them), or they are diminished (respectively) by those (integral quantities that are to be subtracted).</p>
<p><strong>97$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>. The operation of proportionate division to be conducted here is according to any of the rules in stanzas 87$\frac{1}{2}$ to 89$\frac{1}{2}$.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>98$\frac{1}{2}$. Four men obtained their shares in successively doubled proportions and with successively doubled differences in addition, the first man obtaining one share : 67 (is the quantity so to be distributed) here. What is the share of each ?</p>
<p>99$\frac{1}{2}$. (A sum of) 78 is divided by these four (among themselves) in proportions which are sucessively from the first 1$\frac{1}{2}$ times (what precedes) and with differenees (in addition, which,) commencing with 1, (go on) increasing three-fold. Give out the (value of the parts obtained (by each.)</p>
<p>100$\frac{1}{2}$.(The,shares of) five (persons) are (successively) from the first 1$\frac{1}{2}$ times (what goes before), and the differences in addition are quantities which are (successively) 2$\frac{1}{2}$times (the preceding difference) 51$\frac{3}{4}$is (the total quantity) to be divided. (Find out the values of the portions obtained by each.)</p>
<p>101$\frac{1}{2}$. (A sum of) 400 <em>minus</em> 15 is divided by four men (among themselves) in proportions which from the first are 2$\frac{1}{2}$times (what precedes), and which (besides) are less by differences which are (successively) 4 times (the preceding difference). (Find out the values of the various portions obtained.)</p>
<p>Therule for arriving at the value of the prices producing equal sale-proceeds and at the value of the highest capital (invested in the transactions concerned) :-</p>
<p>102$\frac{1}{2}$. The largest capital (invested) combined with <em>one</em> becomes the vending rate of the commodity (to be sold). That (same vending rate), multiplied by the (given) price at which the remnant is to be sold, and diminished by <em>one</em>, gives rise to thepurchasing rate. By reversing the processes, one may arrive at the valuation of the highest capital invested in the transaction).</p>
<p><strong>98</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The difference quantity to be added to the shares here is 1in the case of the second man, and twice the preceding difference in the case of each of the remaining two men and this difference in the case of the second man is net expressly mentioned as 1in this example as well as in the example in stanza 101$\frac{1}{2}$.</p>
<p><strong>102</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The examples bearing on this rule contemplate the purchase of a commodity at a certain common rate for various capital amounts; then the commodity so purchased isto be sold at a certain other common rate. That quantity of the commodity which is left over, owing to its not being enough to be sold for a unit of the kind of money employed in the transaction, is herespoken of as the remnant, and the price at which this remnant is sold the remnant-price.<br>
Symbolically, leta, <em>a</em>, <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> and<em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> be the capitals, where the last is the ज्येष्ठधन or the largest capital, and let <em>p</em> be the चरमार्घ or the remnant-price; then, according to the rule, <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em>+ 1 =the vending rate;and (<em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> + 1) <em>p</em> - 1 = the purchasing rate.<br>
From these, it can be easily shown that the sum of the amounts realised by selling the commodity at the vendling rate and the remnant at the remnant-price turns out to be the same in each case.<br>
It may be noted that the purchasing rate happens in problems bearing on this rule to be the same in value as the समधन or the equal sale-proceeds.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>103$\frac{1}{2}$. The capital amounts invested by (three) men are (respectively) 2, 8 and 36; 6 is the price at which the remnants of the commodity are to be sold. Having purchased and sold at the same rates, they became possessors of equal wealth. (Find out the buying and selling prices.)</p>
<p>104$\frac{1}{2}$. Those three persons took up 1$\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{2}$ and 2$\frac{1}{2}$ (as their respective capital amounts) and conducted the operations of buying and selling (in relation to the same commodity at the same rates of price); by selling the remnant (in the end) at a price copresented by 6, they became possessors of equal wealth. (Find out their buying and selling prices.)</p>
<p>105$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:234"><a href="#fn:234" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">234</a></sup>. The quantity mensuring the equal wealth is 41, and the price at which the remnants of the commodity are sold is 6. O arithmetician, tell me quickly what the highest capital (invested) is, and what the (various) capitals are.</p>
<p>106$\frac{1}{2}$. In the ease where 35 <em>dīnāras</em>give the numerical measure of the equal wealth, and 4 is the price at which the remnant is to bo sold, you tell me, 0 arithmetician, what the highest capital (invested) is.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the prices producing equal sale-proceeds when the price of the remnant is fractional in character :-</p>
<p>107$\frac{1}{2}$. When the remnant-price is fractional in character, the selling and the buying rates are to be derived as before with (the data consisting of) the (invested) capitals and the remnant-pricereduced to the same denominator, which is (however) ignored (for tho time being); these selling and buying rates are (then respectively) to be multiplied by (this) denominator and the square of (this) denominator (for arriving at the required selling and buying rates). The value of the equal sale-proceeds is (then obtained) by means of the rule-of-three.</p>
<p>An example in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>108$\frac{1}{2}$. (In a transaction) $\frac{1}{2},~\frac{1}{3},~\frac{1}{4}$are the capital amounts (invested respectively by three persons); the remnant-price is $\frac{6}{3}$. By purchasing and selling at the same prices, they became possessed of equal sale-proceeds. (What is the buying price, what the selling price, and what the equal sale-amount ?)</p>
<p>Again, another rule for arriving at the value of the equal sale-proceeds, when the remnant-price is fractional :-<br>
109$\frac{1}{2}$. The continued product of the highest numerator, of <em>two</em>, and of (all) the denominators (to be found in the values of the capital amounts invested), when combined with the (last) denominator belonging to the value of the remnant-price, gives rise to the selling rate. This multiplied by the remnant-price, and then diminished by <em>one</em>, and then multiplied (successively) by <em>two</em> and all the denominators, becomes the purchasing rate. Then the rule-of-three (is to be used for arriving at the common value of the sale-amounts).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>110$\frac{1}{2}$. Having invested $\frac{1}{2},~\frac{2}{3},~\frac{3}{4}$ (respectively), and having bought and sold (the same commodity), and with$\frac{5}{4}$ as the remnant-price, three merchants became possessors of equal sale-proceeds(in the end. What is the buying price, what is the selling price, and what the equal sale-amount ?)</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at (the solution of a problem wherein) optionally chosen quantities (are) bestowed in optionally chosen multiples for an optionally chosen number of times :-</p>
<p>111$\frac{1}{2}$. Let the penultimatequantity be added to the ultimate quantity as divided by its own corresponding multiple number, and let the result of this operation be divided by that (multiplenumber which is associated with this) penultimatequantity (given in the problem). What results (from carrying out this operation throughout in relation to all the various quantities bestowed) happens to be the (required) original quantity.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>112$\frac{1}{2}$ and 113$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain lay follower of Jainism went to a Jina temple with four gate-ways, and having taken (with him) fragrant flowers offered then (thus) in worship with devotion :- At the four gate-ways, they became doubled, then trebled, then quadrupled and then quintupled (respectively in order.) Thenumber of flowers offered by him was five at every (gate-way). How many were the lotuses (originally taken by him)?</p>
<p>114$\frac{1}{2}$. Flowers were obtained and offered in worship by devotees with devotion, the flowers (so offered) being (successively) 3, 5, 7 and 8; (their corresponding) multiple guantities being $\frac{1}{2},~\frac{1}{3},~\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{5}{2}$ (in order. Find out the original number of flowers).</p>
<p>Thus ends proportionate division in this chapter on mixed problems.</p>
<p><strong>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall explain the process of calculation known as<em>Vallikā</em>-<sup id="fnref:235"><a href="#fn:235" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">235</a></sup><em>kuṭṭīkāra<sup id="fnref1:235"><a href="#fn:235" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">235</a></sup></em> :-</p>
<p>The rule underlying the process of calculation known as <em>Vallikā</em> in relation to <em>Kuṭṭīkāra</em> (which is a special kind of division or distribution) :-</p>
<p>115$\frac{1}{2}$. Divide the (given) group-number by the (given) divisor; discard the first quotient; then put down one below the other the (various) quotients obtained by the successive division (of the various resulting divisors by the various resulting remainders; again), put down below this the optionally chosen number,with which the least remainder in the odd position of order (in the above-mentioned process of successive division) is to be multiplied; and (then put down) below (this again) this product increased or decreased (as the case may be by the given known number) and then divided (by the last divisor in the above mentioned process of successive division. Thus the <em>Vallikā</em> or the creeper-like chain of figures is obtained. In this) the sum obtained by adding (the lowermost number in the chain) to the product obtained by multiplying the number above it with the number (immediately) above (this upper number, this process of addition being in the same way continued till the whole chain is exhausted,) this sum, is to be divided by the (originallygiven) divisor. (The remainder in this last division becomes the multiplier with which the originally given group-number is to be multiplied for the purpose of arriving at the quantity which is to be divided or distributed in the manner indicated in the problem. Where, however, the given group-numbers, increased or decreased in more than one way, are to be divided or distributed in more than one proportion,) the divisor related to the larger group-value, (arrived at as explained above in relation to either of two specified distributions), is to be divided (as above) by the divisor (related tothe smaller group-value, so that acreeper-like chain of successive quotients may be obtained in this case also as before. Below the lowermost quotient in this chain, the optionally chosen multiplier of the least remainder in the odd position of order in this last successive division is to be put down; and below this again is to be put down the number which is obtained by) adding the difference between the two group-values (already referred to) to the product (of the least remainder in the last odd position of order multiplied by the above optionally chosen multiplier thereof, and then by dividing the resulting sum by the Iast divisor in theabove division chain. Thus the creeper-like chain of figures required for the solution of this latter combined problem is obtained. This chain is to be dealt with as before from below upwards, and the resulting number is to be divided as before by the first divisor in this last division chain. The remainder obtained in this operation is then) to be multiplied by the divisor (related to the larger group-value, and to the resulting product, this) larger group-value is to he added. (Thus the value of the required multiplier of the given group-number is obtained ; and this will satisfy both the specified distributions takentogether into consideration).</p>
<p>115$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will become clear from the following working of the problem in stanza No. 117$\frac{1}{2}$.<br>
Here it is stated that 63 heaps of plantains together with 7 separate fruits are exactly divisible among 23 persons; it is required to find out the number of fruits in a heap. Here the 63 is called the &lsquo;group number&rsquo;, and the numerical value of the fruitscontained in each heap is called the &lsquo;group-value&rsquo;, and it is this latter which has to be found out.</p>
<p>Now, according to the rule, we divide first the rāśi, or group-number 63, by the <em>chēda</em> or the divisor 23, and then we coutinue the process of division as in finding out H.C.F. of two nunbers:-</p>

</p>
<p>Here, the first quotient 2 is discarded; the otherquotients are written down in a line one below the<br>
other as in the margin; then we have to choosesuch a number as, when multiplied by the last<br>
remainder 1, and then combined with 7, (the number of separate fruits given in the problem,)will be divisible by the last divisor 1. We accordingly choose 1, which is written down below the last figure in the chain; and below this chosen number, again, is written down the quotient obtained in the above division with the help of the chosen number. Here we stop the division with the fifth remainder as it is the least remainder in the odd position of order in the series of divisions carried out here.</p>
<p>Thus weget the chain or <em>Vallikā</em> noted in the first column of figures in the margin.</p>
<p><figure class="">

Then wemultiply the penultimate figure below in the chain, viz., 1, by 4, which is above it, and add 8, the lastnumber in the chain; the resulting 12 is written down so as to be in the place corresponding to 4 : then multiplying this 12 by 1 which is the figure above it in the creeper chain, and adding 1, the figure similarly below it, we get 13 in the place of 1; proceeding in the same manner 38 and 51 are obtained in the places of 2and 1 respectively. This 51 is divided by 23, the divisor in the problem; and the remainder 5 is seen to be the least number of fruits in a bunch.</p>
<p>The rationale of the rule will be clear from the following algebraical representation :-</p>
<p>$\frac{Bx~ + ~b}{A}~ = ~y$ (an integer) = <em>q</em>₁+<em>p</em>₁, where $p_{1}~ = ~\frac{\left( B~ - ~Aq_{1} \right)~x~ + ~b}{A}$.</p>
<p>$\therefore~x~ = ~\frac{Ap_{1}~ - ~b}{r_{1}}$, (where<em>r</em>₁=<em>B</em>−<em>A**q</em>₁the first remainder) = $= ~q_{2}p_{1}~ + ~p_{2},~where~p_{2}~ = ~\frac{r_{2}p_{1}~ - ~b}{r_{1}}$, and **q<em>₂</em>is the second quotient and **r<em>₂</em>the second remainder.</p>
<p>Hence, $p_{1}~ = ~\frac{r_{1}p_{2}~ + ~b}{r_{2}}~ = ~q_{3}p_{2}~ + ~p_{3},~where~p_{3}~ = ~\frac{r_{3}p_{2}~ + ~b}{r_{3}}$and <em>q</em>₃is the third quotient and <em>r</em>₃the third remainder.</p>
<p>Similarly, $p_{2}~ = \frac{r_{2}p_{3}~ - ~b}{r_{3}}~ = ~q_{4}p_{3}~ + ~p_{4},~where~p_{4}~ = ~\frac{r_{4}p_{3}~ - ~b}{r_{3}}$.</p>
<p>Thus we have,</p>
<p><em>x</em>=<em>q</em>₂<em>p</em>₁+<em>p</em>₂; <em>p</em>₁=<em>q</em>₃<em>p</em>₂+<em>p</em>₃; <em>p</em>₂=<em>q</em>₄<em>p</em>₃+<em>p</em>₄; <em>p</em>₃=<em>q</em>₅<em>p</em>₄+<em>p</em>₅.</p>
<p>By choosing a value for <em>p</em>₄ such that $\frac{r_{5}p_{4}~ + ~b}{r_{4}}$, which is, as shown above, the value of <em>p</em>₅, becomes an integer, and by arranging in a chain <em>q</em>₂,<em>q</em>₃,<em>q</em>₄,<em>q</em>₅,<em>q</em>₄ and <em>p</em>₅we get at the value of <em>x</em> by proceeding as stated in the rule, that is, by the processes of multiplication by the upper quantity and the addition ofthe lower quantity in the chain, which are carried up to the topmost quantity. The value of <em>x</em>so obtained is divided by <em>A</em>, and the remainder represents the least value of<em>x</em>; for the values of <em>x</em> which satisfy the equation, $\frac{Bx~ + ~b}{A}~ =$an integer, are all in an arithmetical progression wherein the common difference is <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>This same rule contemplates problems where two or more conditions are given, such as the problems given in stanzas 121$\frac{1}{2}$ to 129$\frac{1}{2}$. The problem in 121$\frac{1}{2}$ may be thus worked out according to the rule :- It is given that a heap of fruits when diminished by 7 is exactly divisible among 8men, and the same heap when diminished by 3 is exactly divisible among 13 men.</p>
<p>Now, according to the method already given, find out first the least number of fruits that will satisfy the first condition, and then find out the number of fruits that will satisfy the second condition. Thus we get the group-values 15and 16 respectively. Now, the divisor related to the larger group-value is divided as before by that related to the smaller group-value to obtain a fresh <em>vallikā</em> chain. Thus dividing 13 by 8 and continuing the division, we have -</p>

<p>From this the <em>Vallikā</em> chain comes out thus - Choosing 1 as the <em>mati</em>, and adding the difference between the two group-values already arrived at, that is, 16-15, or 1, to the product of the <em>mati</em> and the last divisor, and dividing this sum by the lastdivisor, we have 2, which is to be written down below the <em>mati</em> in the <em>Vallikā</em> chain. Then proceeding as before with the <em>Vallikā</em>, we get 11,which, when divided by the first divisor 8, leaves the reminder 3. This is multiplied by the divisor related to the larger group-value, viz., 13, and then is combined with the larger group-value. Thus 55 is the number of fruits in the heap.</p>
<p>The rationale of this process will be clear from the following considerations:-</p>
<p>We have (i) $\frac{B_{1}x~ + ~b_{1}}{A_{1}}$is an integer; (i) $\frac{B_{2}x~ + ~b_{2}}{A_{2}}$is an integer; and (iii) $\frac{B_{3}x~ + ~b_{3}}{A_{3}}$is an integer.</p>
<p>In (i) Let the lowest value of<em>x</em>=<em>s</em>₁.</p>
<p>In (ii)Let the lowest value of <em>x</em>=<em>s</em>₂.</p>
<p>In (iii)Let the lowest value of <em>x</em>=<em>s</em>₃.</p>
<p>(iv) When both (i) and (ii) are to be satisfied, <em>d**A</em>₁+<em>s</em>₁, hasto be equal to <em>k**A</em>₂+<em>s</em>₂, so that <em>s</em>₁−<em>s</em>₂=<em>k**A</em>₂−<em>d**A</em>₁.That is, $\frac{A_{1}d~ + ~\left( s_{1}~ - ~s_{2)} \right.}{A_{3}}~ = ~k$. From (iv), which is an indeterminate equation with the values of <em>d</em> and <em>k</em> unknown, we arrive, according to what has been already proved, at the lowest positive integral value of d. This value of <em>d</em> multiplied by <em>A₁</em>, and then inereased by<em>s₁</em>, gives the value of <em>x</em> which will satisfy (i) and (ii).</p>
<p>Let this be <em>t₁</em>;and let the next higher value of <em>x</em> which will satisfy both these equations be <em>t₂</em>.</p>
<p>(v) Now, <em>t</em>₁+<em>n**A</em>₁=<em>t</em>₂;</p>
<p>vi) and <em>t</em>₁+<em>m**A</em>₂=<em>t</em>₂.</p>
<p>$\therefore~\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}~ = ~\frac{m}{n}$. Thus <em>A</em>₁=<em>m**p</em>, and <em>A</em>₂=<em>n**p</em>, where p is the hightest common factor between <em>A</em>₁and <em>A</em>₂. Hence, $m~ = ~\frac{A_{1}}{p},~and~n~ = ~\frac{A_{2}}{p}$. Substituting in (v) or (vi), we have $t_{1}~ + ~\frac{A_{1}A_{2}}{p}~ = ~t_{2}$.</p>
<p>From this it is obvious that the next higher value of <em>x</em> satisfying the two equations is obtained by adding the least common multiple of <em>A</em>₁, and <em>A</em>₂, to the lower value.</p>
<p>Now again, let <em>v</em> be the value of <em>x</em> which satisfies all the three equations. Then $v~ = ~t_{1}~ + ~\frac{A_{1}A_{2}}{p}~ \times ~r$, (where <em>r</em> is a positive integer) = (say) <em>t</em>₁+<em>d</em><em>(<em>r</em>);and <em>v</em>=<em>s</em>₃+<em>c**A</em>₃=<em>t</em>₁+<em>l</em></em>(<em>r</em>). Hence, $r~ = ~\frac{cA_{3}~ + ~s_{3}~ - ~t_{1}}{l}$.</p>
<p>By applying the principle of <em>vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em> in the last equation, the value of <em>c</em> obtained, and thence the value of <em>v</em> can be easily arrived at.<br>
It is seen from this that, when, in order to find out <em>v</em>, we deal with **t<em>₁</em>, and <em>s</em>₃ in accordance with the <em>kuṭṭīkāra</em> method, the <em>chēda</em> or the divisor to be taken in relation to <em>t</em>₁is $\frac{A_{1}A_{2}}{p}$, or the least common multiple of the divisorsinthe first two equations.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>116$\frac{1}{2}$. Into the bright and refreshing outskirts of a forest, which were full of numerous trees with their branches bent down with the weight of flowers and fruits, trees such as <em>jambū</em>trees, lime trees, plantains, areca palms, jack trees, date-palms, <em>hintāla</em>trees, palmyras, <em>punnāga</em> trees and mango trees - (into the outskirts), the various quarters whereof were filled with the many sounds of crowds of parrots and cuckoos found near springs containing lotuses with bees roaming about them - (into such forest outskirts) a number of weary travellers entered with joy.</p>
<p>117$\frac{1}{2}$. (There were) 63 (numerically equal) heaps of plantain fruits put together and combined with 7 (more) of those samefruits; and these were (equally) distributed among 23 travellers so as to leave no remainder. You tell (me now) the(numerical) measure of a heap (of plantains.)</p>
<p>118$\frac{1}{2}$. Again, in relation to 12 (numerically equal) heaps of pomegranates, which, after having been put together andcombined with 5 of those (same fruits), were distributed similarly among 19 travellers. Give out the (numerical) measure of (any) one (heap).</p>
<p>119$\frac{1}{2}$. A traveller sees heaps of mangoes (equal in numerical value), and makes 31 heaps less by 3 (fruits); and when the remainder (of these 31 heaps) is (equally) divided among 73 men, there is no remainder. Give out the numerical value of one (of these heaps).</p>
<p>120$\frac{1}{2}$. In the forest 37 heaps of wood-apples were seen by the travellers. After 17 fruits were removed (therefrom, the remainder) was (equally) divided among 79 persons (so as to leave no remainder). What is the share obtained by each ?</p>
<p>121$\frac{1}{2}$. When, after seeing a heap of mangoes in the forest and removing 7 fruits (therefrom), it was divided equally among 8 of the travellers; and when again after removing 3 (fruits) from that (same) heap it was (equally) divided among 13 of them; it left no remainder (in both cases). O arithmetician, tell me (thenumerical measure of this) single heap.</p>
<p>122$\frac{1}{2}$. A single heap of wood-apples divided among 2, 3, 4, or 5 (persons) leaves 1 as remainder (in each case). O you who know arithmetic, tell me the (numerical) measure of that (heap).</p>
<p>123$\frac{1}{2}$. When (divided) by 2, the remainder is 1; when by 3, it is 2; when by 4, it is 3; when by 5, it is 4. Tell me, O friend, what this heap is.</p>

<p>125$\frac{1}{2}$. When divided by 2, there is no remainder; when by 3, there is 1as remainder; when by 4, there is no remainder; and when by 5, there is one as remainder. What is this quantity ?</p>
<p>126$\frac{1}{2}$. When divided by 2 (the remainder is) 1; when by 3, there is no remainder; when by 4, (the remainder is) 3; and when divided by 5, there is no reminder. Tell me now what (this) quantity is.</p>
<p>127$\frac{1}{2}$. The travellers saw on the way certain (equal) heaps of <em>jambū</em>fruits. Of them, 2 (heaps) were equally divided among 9 asceties and left 3 (fruits) as remainder. Again 3 (heaps) were (similarly) divided among 11 persons, and the remainder was 5 fruits; then again 5 of those heaps were similarly divided among 7and there were 4 more fruits (left out) of them. O you arithmetician who know the meaning of the <em>kuṭṭīkāra</em> process of distribution, tell me after thinking out well the numerical measure of a heap (here).</p>
<p>128$\frac{1}{2}$. In the interior of the forest, 3 heaps (equal in value) of pomegranates were divided (equally) among 7 travellers, leaving 1(fruit) as remainder; 7 (of such heaps) were divided (similarly) among 9, leaving a remainder of 3 (fruits ; again) 5 (of such heaps) were(similarly) divided among 8, leaving 2 fruits as remainder. O arithmetician, what (is the numerical value of a heap here).</p>
<p>129$\frac{1}{2}$. There were 5 (heaps of fruits equal in numerical value), which after being combined with 2 (fruits of the same kind) were (equally) divided among 9 travellers (and left no remainder); 6 (heaps) combined with 4 (fruits) were (similarly) divided among 8 of them; and 4 (heaps) combined with 1 (fruit) were (also similarly) divided among 7 of them. Give out the numerical measure (of a heap here).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the original quantity distributed (as desired), after obtaining the remainder due to (the removal of certain specified) known quantities :-</p>
<p>130$\frac{1}{2}$.(Obtain) the product of the (given) known quantity (to be removed), as multiplied by the fractional proportion of what is left (after a specified fractional part of what remains on the removal of the given known quantity has been given away). The next quantity is (obtained by means of) this (product), to whichthe specified known quantity which is to be taken away (from the previous remainder) is added; (and this resulting sum) is multiplied by that (same kind of) remaining fractional proportion (of the remainder as has been mentioned above). This is to be done as many times as there are distributions to be made. Then these quantities so obtained should be deprived of their denominators; and these denominator-less quantities (and the succesive products of the above-mentioned remaining fractional proportions of the remainder) are (to be used as) the known quantity and the (other elements, viz., the coefficient) multiple (of the unknown quantity and the divisor, required in relation to a problem on <em>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em>).</p>
<p>130$\frac{1}{2}$. Here the known quantity to be removed in called the <em>agra</em>. What remains after the removal of the <em>agra</em> is the remainder. That fraction of this remainder which is given or taken away is the <em>agrāṃśa</em>, and what is left of the remainder after the <em>agrāṃśa</em>is given or taken away is the <em>śēṣāṃśa</em> or the remaining fractional proportion of the remainder. For example, where <em>x</em> is the quantity to be found out, and a is the <em>agra</em> in relation to the first distribution with $\frac{1}{3}$ as the fractional proportion distributed, $\frac{x~ - ~a}{3}$ happens to be the <em>agrāṃśa</em>, and $(x~ - ~a)~ - ~\frac{(x~ - ~a)}{3}$ to be the <em>śēṣāṃśa</em>.</p>
<p>The rulewill be clear from the following working of the problem in 132$\frac{1}{2}$ - 133$\frac{1}{2}$:-<br>
Here 1 is the first <em>agra</em>, and $\frac{1}{3}$ is the first <em>agrāṃśa</em>; therefore $1~ - ~\frac{1}{3}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$ isthe <em>śēṣāṃśa</em>. Now, obtain the product of <em>agra</em> and <em>śēṣāṃśa</em> or $1~ \times ~\frac{2}{3}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$. Write it down in 2 places. {$\frac{2}{3}\frac{2}{3}$}<br>
Repeat the quantities {$\frac{2}{3}\frac{2}{3}$} ;add the second <em>agra</em> 1 (to one of the quantities) Then we have {$\frac{5}{3}\frac{2}{3}$}, multiply both by the next <em>śēṣāṃśa</em> $1~ - ~\frac{1}{3}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$, so that you get {$\frac{10}{9}~\frac{4}{9}$}<br>
Take these figures and add the third <em>agra</em> 1as before and you have {$\frac{19}{9}~\frac{4}{9}$};multiply by the next <em>śēṣāṃśa</em> $1~ - ~\frac{1}{3}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$ und by the last <em>aṃśa</em>or $\frac{1}{3}$;and you have {$\frac{38}{31}\frac{8}{81}$}<br>
The denominators of the first fractions in these three sets of fraction marked I, II, III, are dropped, and the numeratos represent negative<em>agras</em>in a problem on <em>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em>, where in the numerator and the denominator of each of the second fractions in those sets represent respectively the dividend coefficients and the divisor. Thus we have $\frac{(2x~ - ~2)}{3}$is an integer; $\frac{(4x~ - ~10)}{9}$ is an integer ; and $\frac{(8x~ - ~38)}{81}$ is an integer. The value of <em>x</em> satisfying these three conditions gives the number of flowers.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>131$\frac{1}{2}$. On a certain manbringing mango fruits (home, his) elder son took one fruit first and then half of what remained. (On the elder son going away after doing this), the younger (son) did similarly (with what was left there. He further took halfof what was thereafter left); and the other (son) took the other half. (Find the number of fruits brought by the father.)</p>
<p>132$\frac{1}{2}$and 133$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain person went (with flowers) into a Jina temple which was (in height) three times the height of a man. At first he offered one (out of those flowers) in worship at the foot of the Jina and then (offered in worship) one-third of the remaining number (of flowers) to the first height-measure (of the Jina). Out of the remaining two-thirds (of the number of flowers, he conducted worship) in the same manner in relation to the second height-measure; and (then he did) the same thing in relation to the third height-measure also. The two-thirds which remained at last were also made into 3 equal parts (by him); and having worshipped the 24 <em>tīrthaṅkaras</em> (with these parts at the rate of eight <em>tīrthaṅkaras</em>for each part), he went away with no (flower) on hand. (Find out the number of flowers takon by him.)</p>

<p>Hereafter we shall expound complex <em>kuṭṭīkāra</em>. Therule relating to complex <em>kuṭṭīkāra</em>:-</p>
<p>134$\frac{1}{2}$. The (given) divisor, (written down) in two (places), is to be multiplied (in each place) by an optionally chosen number; and the (known) quantity given (in the problem) for the purposeof being added is to be subtracted (from the product in one of these places); and the quantity given (in the problem) for the purpose of being subtracted is to be added (to the product noted down in the other place. The two quantities thus obtained are) to bedivided by the known (coefficient) multiplier (of the unknownquantities to be distributed in accordance with the problem). Each (of the quotients so obtained) happens to be the required (quantity which is to be multiplied by the given) multiplier in the process of <em>Bhinnakuṭṭīkara</em>.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>135$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain quantity multiplied by 6, (then) increased by 10 and (then) divided by 9 leaves no remainder. Similarly. (acertainother quantity multiplied by 6, then) diminished by 10 (and then divided by 9 leaves no remainder). Tell me quickly what those two quantities are (which are thus multiplied by the given multiplier here).</p>
<p><strong>Sakala-kuṭṭīkara.</strong></p>
<p>The rule in relation to <em>sakala-kuṭṭīkara</em>.<br>
136$\frac{1}{2}$. The quotient in the first among the divisions, carried on by means of the dividend-coefficient (of theunknown quantity to bedistributed), as well as by means of the divisor and the (successively) resulting remainders, is to be discarded. The other quotients obtained by means of this mutual division(carried on till the divisor and the remainder become equal) are to be written down (in a vertical chain along with the ultimately equal remainder and divisor); to the lowermost figure (in this chain), the remainder (obtained by dividing the given known quantity in the problem by the divisor therein), is to be added. (Then by means of these numbers in the chain), the sum, (which has to be) obtained by adding (successively to the lowermost number) the product of the twonumbers immediately above it, (till the topmost figure in the chain becomes included in the operation), is to be arrived at. (Thereafter) this resulting sum and the divisor in the problem (give rise), in the shape of two remainders, (to the two values of) the unknown quantity (which is to be multiplied by the given dividend-coefficient in the problem), which (values) are related either to the known given quantity that is to be added or to the known given quantity that is to be subtracted, according as the number of figure-links in the above-mentioned chain of quotients is even or odd. (Where, however, the given groups, increased or decreased in morethan one way, are to be divided or distributed in more than one proportion), the divisor related to the larger group-value, (arrived at as explained above in relation to either of two specified distributions), is to be divided over and over (as above by the divisorrelated to the smaller group-value obtained as above so that a creeper-like chain of successive quotients may be obtained in this case also. Below the lowermost quotient in this chain the optionally chosen multiplier of the least remainder in the odd position of order in this last successive division is to be put downas before; and below this again is to be put down) the number which is obtained by adding the difference between the two group-values, (already referred to, to the product of the least remainder in the odd position of order multiplied by the above optionally chosen multiplier thereof, and then by dividing this resulting sum by the last divisor in the above division chain.</p>
<p>Thus the creeper-like chain of figures required for the solution of this latter kind of problem is obtained. This chain is to be dealt with as before from below upwards, and the resulting number is to be divided as before by the first divisor in this last division chain. The remainder obtained in this operation is then to be) multiplied by the divisor (related to the larger group-value); and to the resulting product this larger group-value is to be added.</p>
<p>(Thus the value of the required multiplier of the given group number is obtained so as to satisfy the two specified distributions taken into consideration.)</p>
<p><strong>136</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. This rule will become clear from the following working of the problem given in 137$\frac{1}{2}$ -The problem is, when $\frac{177x~ \pm ~240}{201}$is an integer, to find out the values of <em>x</em>. Removing the common factors, wehave $\frac{59x~ \pm ~80}{67}$ is an integer.</p>

</p>
<p>After discarding the first quotient, the others are written down in a chain thus:-</p>
<p>Below this are next wiitten down 1 and 1, the last equal divisor and remainder. Here also, as in <em>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em>, it is worthyof note that in the last division there can be really no remainder, as 2 is fully divisible by 1. But since the last remainder is wanted for the chain, it is allowed to occur by making the last quotient smaller than possible. And to the last number 1 here, add 13, which is the remainder obtained by dividing 80 by 67; the 14 so obtained is also written down at the bottom of the chain, which now becomes complete.</p>
<p>Now, by the continued process of multiplying and adding the figures in this chain, as already explained in the note under stanza No. 115$\frac{1}{2}$,we arrive at 392. This is then dividedby 67; and the remainder 57 is one of the values of <em>x</em>, when 80 is taken as negative owing to the number of figures in the chain being odd. When 80 is taken as positive, the value of <em>x</em> is 67−57 or 10. If the number of figures in the chain happen to be even, then the value of <em>x</em> first arrived at is in relation to the positive <em>agra</em>; if this value be subtracted from the divisor, the value of <em>x</em> in relation to a negative <em>agra</em> is arrived at.</p>
<p>The principle underlying the process given in the rule is the same as that explained in the rule regarding <em>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em>- but with this difference, namely, that the last two figures in the chain here are obtained in n different way.</p>
<p>Again, from the rationale given in the footnote to rule in 115$\frac{1}{2}$. Ch, VI, it will be seen that the <em>agra</em>, <em>b</em>,associated with the remainder in the odd position of order, has the same algebraical sign as is given to it in the problem while the sign of the <em>agra</em>, <em>b</em>, associated with the remainder in the even position of order is opposite to its sign as given in the problem. Hence, when the continued division is carried up to a remainder in the odd position of order, the value of <em>x</em> arrived at therefrom is in relation to such an <em>agra</em> as has its sign unchanged; on the other hand, when the continueddivision is carried up to a remainder in the even position of order, the value of arrived at therefore is in relation to an <em>agra</em> that has its sign changed. When the number of remainders obtained is odd, the number of quotients in the chain is even; and when the remainders are even, the quotients are odd in number. As the <em>agra</em> associated with the last remainder is in this rule always taken to be positive, the value of <em>x</em> arrived at is in relation to the positive <em>agra</em>, if the last remainder happens to be in the odd position of order. And it is in relation to the negative <em>agra</em>, if the last remainder happens to be in the even position of order. In other words, if the number of quotients beeven, the value is in relation to the positive agra; and ifthe number of quotients be odd, it is in relation to the negative <em>agra</em>.</p>
<p>The value of <em>x</em>in relation to the positive or the negative <em>agra</em> being thus found out, the other value is arrived at by subtracting this value from the divisor in the problem. How this turns out will be clear from the following representation :-</p>
<p>$\frac{Ax~ + ~b}{B}$ =an integer. Here let <em>x</em>=<em>c</em>: then $\frac{Ac~ + ~b}{B}$ =an integer. Weknow that $\frac{AB}{B}$ is also an integer. Hence $\frac{AB}{B}~ - ~\frac{Ac~ + ~b}{B}~or~\frac{A(B~ - ~c)~ - ~b}{B}$ is an integer.</p>
<p>It has to be noted here that the common factor, if any, of the three given numerical quantities is to be removed before the operation of continued division is begun. The last divisor and the last remainder being required to be equal it will invariably happen that these come to be 1.</p>
<p>The <em>mati</em>, required to be closenin the rule relating to the <em>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em> and required to be written below the chain of quotients, is in this rule always 1. the last divisor being 1. Therefore the last divisor here takes the place of the <em>mati</em> in the *Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra.*It will be seen further that the last figare of the chain obtained according to this rule, i.e., <em>l</em> + *agra,*is the same as the last figure in the chain obtained in the <em>Vallikā-kuṭṭīkāra</em> by dividing by the last divisor the sum of the <em>agra</em> and the product of the <em>mati</em> as multiplied by the last reminder.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>137$\frac{1}{2}$. One hundred and seventy-seven (is the dividend-coefficient of the unknown factor), 240 is the known quantity associated (with the product so as to be added to or subtracted from it); the whole is divided by 201 (and leaves no remainder). What is the (unknown) factor here (with which the given dividend-coefficient is to be multiplied)?</p>
<p>138$\frac{1}{2}$. Thirty-five and other quantities, 16 in number, rising (thence successively in value) by 3, (are the given dividend-coefficients). The given divisors are 32 (and others) as successively increased by 2. And 1 successively increased by 3 gives rise to the associated known (positive and negative) quantities. What are the values of the(unknown) factors of the known dividend-coefficients), according as they are additively associated with positive or negative (known) numbers ?</p>
<p>The rule for separating the prices of (an interchangeable) larger and (a similar) smaller number of two different things from the given mixed sums of the prices of these things :-</p>
<p>139$\frac{1}{2}$. From the higher price-sum, as multiplied by the corresponding larger number of one of the two kinds of things subtract the lower price-number as multiplied by the smaller number relating to the other of the two kinds of things. Then divide the result by the difference between the squares of the numbers relating to these things. This gives rise to the price of the thing which is larger in number. The other, that is, the price of the thing which is smaller in number, is obtained by interchanging the multipliers.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>140$\frac{1}{2}$to 142$\frac{1}{2}$. The mixed price of 9 citrons and 7 fragrant wood-apples is 107; again the mixed price of 7 citrons and 9 fragrant wood-apples is 101. O you arithmetician, tell me quickly the price of a citron and of a wood-apple here, having distinctly separated those prices well.</p>
<p>The rule for separating the prices and the numbers of different mixed quantities of different kinds of things from their given mixed price and given mixed values:-</p>
<p>143$\frac{1}{2}$. The (different) given (mixed) quantities (of the different things) are to be multiplied by an optionally chosen number; the given (mixed) price (of these mixed quantities) is to be diminished (by the value of these products separately). The resulting quantitiesareto be divided (one after another) by an optionally chosen number (and the remainders again are to be divided by an optionally chosen number, this process being repeated) over and over again. The given (mixed) quantities of the different things are to be (successively) diminished by the corresponding quotients in the above process. (In this manner the numerical values of the various things in the mixed sums are arrived at). The optionally chosen divisors (in the above processes of continued division) combined with the optionally chosen multiplier as also that multiplier constitute (respectively) the prices (of a single thing in each of the varieties of the given different things).</p>
<p><strong>139</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically, if <em>a**x</em>+<em>b**y</em>=<em>m</em> and <em>b**x</em>+<em>a**y</em>=<em>n</em>, then <em>a</em>²<em>x</em>+<em>a<strong>b</strong>y</em>=<em>a**m</em> and <em>b</em>²<em>x</em>+<em>a<strong>b</strong>y</em>=<em>b**n</em>. ∴<em>x</em>(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)=<em>a**m</em>−<em>b**n</em>.$\therefore~x~ = ~\frac{am~ - ~bn}{a^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}$</p>
<p><strong>143</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will become clear by the following working of the problem in stanzas 144$\frac{1}{2}$ and 145$\frac{1}{2}$:</p>
<p>The total number of fruits in the first heap is 21.</p>
<p>The total number of fruits in the second heap is 22.</p>
<p>The total number of fruits in the third heap is 23.</p>
<p>Choose any optional number, say 2, and multiply with it these total numbers; we get 42, 44, 46. Subtract these from 73, the price of the respective heaps. The remainders are 31, 29, and 27. These are to be divided by another optionally chosen number, say 8. The quotients are3, 3, 3, and the remainders are 7, 5 and 3. These remainders are again divided by a third optionally chosen number say 2. The quotients are 3, 2, 1, and the remainders are 1, 1, 1. These last remainders are in their turn divided by a fourth optionally chosen number which is 1 here. The quotients are 1, 1, 1 with no remainders. The quotients derived in relation to the first total number are to be subtracted from it. Thus we get 21−(3+3+1)=14;this number and the quotients 3, 3, 1 represent the number of fruits of the different sorts in the first heap. Similarly we get in the second group 16, 3, 2, 1, and in the third group 18, 3, 1, 1, as the number of the different sorts of fruits.<br>
The prices are the first chosen multiplier, viz., 2, and its sums with the other optionally chosen multipliers. Thus we get 2,2+8<em>o**r</em>10,2+2<em>o**r</em>4, and 2+1<em>o**r</em>3, as the price of one of the four different kinds of fruits in order.<br>
The principle underlying this method will be clear from the following algebraical representation :-<br>
<em>a**x</em>+<em>b**y</em>+<em>c**z</em>+<em>d**w</em>=<em>p</em> &hellip; &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;.
&hellip;. &hellip; &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;.. &hellip;. &hellip;.. I</p>
<p><em>a</em>+<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>=<em>n</em>&hellip; &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip; &hellip;.
&hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;.. &hellip;. &hellip;&hellip; II</p>
<p>Let <em>w</em>=<em>s</em>.</p>
<p>Multiplying II by s, we have <em>s</em>(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>)=<em>s**n</em> &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip;.. &hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;.. &hellip;. &hellip;.III</p>
<p>Subtracting III from I, we get <em>a</em>(<em>x</em>−<em>s</em>)+<em>b</em>(<em>y</em>−<em>s</em>)+<em>c</em>(<em>z</em>−<em>s</em>)=<em>p</em>−<em>s**n</em>&hellip;.. IV<br>
Dividing IV by <em>x</em>−<em>s</em>, we get <em>a</em> as the quotient, and <em>b</em>(<em>y</em>−<em>s</em>)+<em>c</em>(<em>z</em>−<em>s</em>) as the remainder, where <em>x</em>−<em>s</em>is a suitable integer.<br>
Similarly we proceed to the end.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that the successively chosen divisors <em>x</em>−<em>s</em>,<em>y</em>−<em>s</em>and <em>z</em>−<em>s</em>, when combined with <em>s</em>, give the value of the various prices, <em>s</em> by itself being the price of the first thing; and that the successive quotiens a, b, c, along with <em>n</em>−(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>) are the numbers measuring the various kinds of things.<br>
It may be noted that, in this rule, the number of divisions to be carriedout is one less than the number of the kinds of things given, and that there should be no remainder left in the last division.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>144$\frac{1}{2}$and 145$\frac{1}{2}$. There are here fragrant citrons, plantains, wood-apples and pomegranates mixed up (in three heaps). The number of fruits in the first (heap) is 21, in the second 22and in the third 23. The combined price of each of these (heaps) is 73. What is the number of the (various) fruits (in each of the heaps), and what the price (of the different varieties of fruits)?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical value of the prices of dearer and cheaper things (respectively) from the given mixed value (of their total price) :-</p>
<p>146$\frac{1}{2}$. Divide (the rate-quantities of the given things) by their rate-prices. Diminish (these resulting quantities separately) by the least among them. Then multiply by the least (of the above-mentioned quotiont-quantities) the given mixed price of all the things; and subtract (this product) from the given (total number of the various) things. Then split up (this remainder optionally) into as many (bits as there are remainders of the above quotient-quantities left after subtraction); and then divide (these bits by those remainders of the quotient-quantities. Thus the prices of the various cheaper things are arrived at). These, separated from the total price, give rise to the price of the dearest article of purchase.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>147$\frac{1}{2}$ to 149. &ldquo;In accordance with the rates of 3 peacocks for 2 <em>paṇas</em>, 4 pigeons for 3 <em>paṇas</em>, 5 swans for 4 <em>paṇas</em>, and 6 sārasabirds for 5 <em>paṇas</em>, purchase, O friend, for 56 <em>paṇas</em>72 birds and bring them (to me)&rdquo;. So saying a man gave over the purchase-money (to his friend). Calculate quickly and find out how many birds (of each variety he bought) for how many <em>paṇas</em>.</p>
<p>146$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will be clear from the following working of the problem given in 147$\frac{1}{2}$ -149:-<br>
Divide the rate-quantities 3, 4, 5, 6 by the respective rate-prices 2, 3, 4, 5 thus we have $\frac{3}{2},~\frac{4}{3},~\frac{5}{4},~\frac{6}{5}$.Subtract the least of these $\frac{6}{5}$ from each of the other three. We get $\frac{3}{10},~\frac{2}{15},~\frac{1}{20}$. By multiplying the given mixed price, 56, by the above-mentionedleast quantity, $\frac{6}{5}$, we have $56~ \times ~\frac{6}{5}$.Subtract this from the totalnumber of birds, 72. Split up the remainder $\frac{24}{6}$ into any three parts, say $\frac{7}{6},~\frac{8}{6},~\frac{9}{6}$. Dividing these respectively by $\frac{3}{10},~\frac{2}{15},~\frac{1}{20}$we get the prices of the first three kinds of birds, $\frac{14}{3}$, 12, 36. The price of the fourth variety of birds can be found out by subtracting all these three prices from the total 56.</p>

<p>Write down the rate-things and the rate-prices intwo rows, one below the other. Multiply by the total price and by the total number of things respectively. Then subtract. Remove the common factor 100. Multiply by the chosen numbers 3, 4, 5, 6. Add the numbers in each horizontal row and remove the common factor 6. Change the position of these figures, and write down in two rows each figure as many times as there are component elements in the corresponding sum changed in position. Multiply the two rows by the rate-prices and the rate-things respectively. Then remove the common factor 6. Multiply by the already chosen numbers 3, 4, 5, 6. The numbers in the two rows represent the proportions according to which the total price and the total number of things become distributed.</p>
<p>This rule relates to a problem in indeterminate equations, and as such, there may be many sets of answers these answers obviously depending upon the quantities chosen optionally as multipliers.</p>
<p>It can be easily seen that, only when certain sets of numbers are chosen as optional multipliers, integral answers are obtained; in other cases,fractional answers are obtained, which are of course not wanted. For an explanation of the rationale of the process, see the note given at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>multiplied by the total number of things purchased; (the latter products are subtracted in order from the former products; the positive remainders are all written down in a line below, the negative remainders in a line above; and all these are reduced to their lowest terms by the removal of the factors which are common to all of them. Then each of these reduced) differences is multiplied by (a separate) optionally chosen quantity; (then those products which are in a line below as well as those which are so above are separately added together); and the sums are written upside down, (the sum of the lower row of numbers being written above and the sum of the upper row being written below. These sums arealso reduced to the lowest terms by means of the removal of common factors, if any; and the resulting quantities) are each of them written down twice, (so as to make one be below the other, as often as there are component elements in the corresponding alternate sum. These numbers thus arranged in two rows) are multiplied by their respective rate-prices and rate-values of things, (the rate-price multiplication being conducted with one row of figures and the rate-number multiplication being in relation to the other row of figures. The products so obtained are again reduced to their lowest terms by the removal of such factors as are common to all of them. Theresulting figures in each vertical row are separately) multiplied (each) by (means of its corresponding originally chosen) optional multiplier. (And the products should be written down as before in two horizontal rows. The numbers in the upper row of products give the proportion in which the purchase money is distributed; those in the lower row of products give the proportion in which the corresponding things purchased aredistributed. Therefore) what remains thereafter is only theoperation of prakṣepaka-kāraṇa (proportionate distribution in accordance with rule-of-three).</p>

<p>152 and 153. Pigeons are sold at the rate of 5 for 3 (<em>paṇas</em>), <em>sārasa</em>birds at the rate of 7 for 5 (<em>paṇas</em>), swans at the rate of 9 for 7 (<em>paṇas</em>), and peacocks at the rate of 3 for 9 (<em>paṇas</em>). A certain man was told to bring at these rates 100 birds for 100 <em>paṇas</em>for the amusement of the king&rsquo;s son, and was sent to do so. What (amount) does he give for each (of the various kinds of birds that he buys)?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measure of two given commodities whose prices are interchanged:-</p>
<ol start="154">
<li>Let (the numerical value of) the sum of the (total selling and buying) money-prices (of the two given commodities) be divided by (the numerical measure of) the sum (of the commodities put together); then let the difference (between the above-mentioned buying and selling prices) be divided by the (numerical measure of any such) difference as may be obtained by subtracting any optionally chosen commodity-quantity from the given measure of the sum of the given commodities. If the operation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> is conducted in relation to these, (viz., the quotient obtained in the first operation aboveand any one of the many quotients that may be obtained in the second operation), the rates at which those commodities are purchased is obtained. Then if the same operation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> as relating to the sum of the commodities and to their difference is carried out, it of course gives rise to (the numerical measure of) the commodities (in question). The alternation (of these above-mentioned purchase-rates) gives rise to the sale-rates. This is the solution of (this kind of) problems as propounded by the learned ; and the rule (itself) has been declared by the great Jina.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>154</strong>. The algebraical representation of the method deseribed in the rule may be given thus in relation to the problem proposed in stane 155 and 156 -<br>

<p>Adding I and II, we have (<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>)=220 &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip; .IV</p>
<p>∴<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>=11 &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip; &hellip; .. V</p>
<p>Again subtracting I from II, we get (<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)(<em>y</em>−<em>x</em>)=12</p>

<p>155 and 156. The original price of one piece of sandalwood and one piece of <em>agaru</em> wood, they being together 20 <em>palas</em> (in weight), is 104 <em>paṇas</em>; when after a time they were sold with their prices mutually altered, 116 <em>paṇas</em>were obtained. You give out their buying and selling rates and the numerical measure of thecommodities, taking 6 and 8 separately as the optional (number) needed by the rule.</p>

<ol start="157">
<li>The number representing the total <em>yōjanas</em> , divided by the total number of horses, gives the <em>yōjanas</em> (which each has at a stage to travel) in turn These<em>yōjanas</em> , as multiplied by the optionally chosen number of horses to be yoked, give the measure of the distance to be travelled over by each horse.</li>

<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the commodity to be found in the hands of each (of a body of joint, proprietors), from the conjoint remainder left after subtracting whatever is desired from the total value of all the commodities :-</p>
<ol start="159">
<li>Let the sum (of the values of the conjoint remainders) of the commodities be divided by the number of men lessened by one; the quotient will be the total value of all the commodities (owned in common).

</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>160 to 162. Four merchants who had invested their money in common were asked each separately by the customs officer what the value of the commodity (they were dealing in) was; and oneeminent merchant (among them), deducting his own investment, said that that (value) was in fact 22. Then another said that it was 23; then another said 24; and the fourth said that it was 27; (in saying so) each of them deducted his own invested amount (from thetotal value of the commodity for sale). O friend, tell me separately the value of the (share in the) commodity owned by each.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at equal amounts of wealth, (as owned in precious gems,) after mutually exchanging any desired number of gems:-</p>
<ol start="163">
<li>The number of gems to be given away is multiplied by the total number of men (taking part in the exchange). This product is (separately) subtracted from the number (of the gems) for sale (owned by each); the continued product of the remainders (so obtained) gives rise to the value of the gem (in each case), provided the remainder relating to it is given up (in obtaining such a product).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="164">
<li>The first man had 6 azure-blue gems (of equal value), the second man had 7 (similar) emeralds, and the other - the third man - had 8 (similar) diamonds.

</ol>
<p>165 and 166. The first man has 16 azure-blue gems, the second has 10 emeralds, and the third man has 8 diamonds.

<p>Then it may be easily found out as required that <em>x</em>=(<em>n</em>−3<em>a</em>)(<em>p</em>−3<em>a</em>);</p>

<p>The rule for arriving at the <em>varṇa</em> of the resulting mixed gold obtained by putting together (different component varieties of) gold of (various) desired <em>varṇas</em>:-</p>
<ol start="169">
<li>
<p>It has to be known that the (sum of the various) products of (the various component quantities of) gold as multiplied by (their respective) <em>varṇas</em>, when divided by (the total quantity of)themixed gold gives rise to the (resulting) <em>varṇa</em>. (The original <em>varṇa</em> of any component part thereof), when divided by the latter resulting <em>varṇa</em>(of the mixed up whole), and multiplied by the (given) quantity of gold (in that component part), gives rise to (that) corresponding quantity of (the mixed) gold (which is equal in value to that same component part thereof).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the buying rate is <em>a</em> things for <em>b</em>and the selling rate is <em>c</em>things for *d,*and if <em>m</em>isthe gain by the transaction, then the capital invested is

</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>170 to 171$\frac{1}{2}$. There are 1 part (of gold) of 1 <em>varṇa</em>, 1 part of 2 <em>varṇas</em>, 1 part of 3 <em>varṇas</em>, 2 parts of 4 <em>varṇas</em>, 4 parts of 5 <em>varṇas</em>, 7 parts of 14 <em>varṇas</em>, and 8 parts of 15 <em>varṇas</em>. Throwing these into the fire: make them all into one (mass), and then (say) what the <em>varṇa</em>of the mixed gold is. This mixed gold is distributed among the owners of the foregoing parts. What does each of them get ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the required weight of gold (of any desired <em>varṇa</em>equivalent in value to given quantities of gold) of given <em>varṇas</em>:-</p>
<p>172$\frac{1}{2}$. The given quantities of gold are all (separately) multiplied by their respective <em>varṇas</em>, and the products are added. The resulting sum is divided by the total weight of the mixed gold; the quotient is to be understood as the resulting average <em>varṇa</em>. This (above-mentioned sum of the products) is separately divided by the desired <em>varṇas</em>(to arrive at the required equivalent weight of this gold).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>173$\frac{1}{2}$. Twenty <em>paṇas</em> (in weight of gold) of 16 <em>varṇas</em>have been exchanged for (gold of) 10 <em>varṇas</em>in quality, you give out how many *purāṇas (*in weight) they become now.</p>
<p>174$\frac{1}{2}$. One hundred and eight (in weight of) gold of 11$\frac{3}{8}$<em>varṇas</em>is exchanged for (gold of) 14 <em>varṇas</em>. What is the equivalent quantity of this new) gold?</p>
<p>The rule for finding out the unknown <em>varṇa</em>:</p>
<p>175$\frac{1}{2}$. From the product obtained by multiplying the total quantity of gold by the resulting <em>varṇa</em>of the mixture, the sum ofthe products obtained by multiplying the (several component) quantities of gold by (their respective <em>varṇas</em>) is to be subtracted. The remainder, when divided by the known component quantity of gold, (the <em>varṇa</em>of which is to be found out), gives rise to the required <em>varṇa</em>; and when divided by the difference between the resulting <em>varṇa</em>and the known <em>varṇa</em>(of an unknown component quantity of gold) gives rise to the (required weight of that) gold.</p>
<p>Another rule in relation to the unknown <em>varṇa</em>:-</p>
<p>176$\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of the products of the (various component quantities of) gold as multiplied by their respective <em>varṇas</em>is to be subtracted from the product of the total quantity of gold as multiplied by the resulting <em>varṇa</em>. Wise people say that this remainder when divided by the weight of the gold of the unknown <em>varṇa</em>gives rise to the required <em>varṇa</em>.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>177$\frac{1}{2}$ and 178. With gold of 6, 4 and 3 (in weight),characterised respectively by 13, 8 and 6 as their <em>varṇas</em>, 5 in weight of gold of an unknown <em>varṇa</em>is mixed. The resulting <em>varṇa</em>of the mixed gold is 11. O you, friend, who know the secrets of calculation, tell me the numerical value of this unknown <em>varṇa.</em></p>
<ol start="179">
<li>Seven in weight (of a given specimen) of gold has exactly 14 as the measure of its <em>varṇa</em>; then 4 in weight (of another specimen of gold) is added to it. The resulting <em>varṇa</em>is 10. Give out the unknown <em>varṇa</em>(of this second specimen of gold).</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the unknown weight of gold :-</p>
<ol start="180">
<li>Subtract the sum, obtained by adding together the products of the (various component quantities of) goldas multiplied by their respective <em>varṇas</em>, from the product of the sum (of the known weights) of gold as multiplied by the now durable resulting <em>varṇa</em>; the remainder divided by the difference between the (known) <em>varṇa</em>of the unknown quantity of gold and the resulting durable <em>varṇa</em>(of the mixed gold) gives rise to the (weight of) gold.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="181">
<li>Threepieces of gold, of 3 each in weight, and of 2, 3, and 4 <em>varṇas</em>(respoctively), are added to (an unknown weight of) gold of 13 <em>varṇas</em>. The resulting <em>varṇa</em>comes to be 10. Tell me, O friend, the measure (of the unknown weight) of gold.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therule for arriving at (the weights of) gold (corresponding to two given <em>varṇas</em>) from (the known weight and <em>varṇa</em>of) the mixture of two (given specimens of) gold of (given) varnas :-</p>
<ol start="182">
<li>Obtain the differences between the resulting <em>varṇa</em>(of the mixture on the one hand) and the known higher and lower <em>varṇas</em>(of the unknown component quantities of gold on the other hand); divide <em>one</em> by these differences (in order); then carry out as before the operation of <em>prakṣēpaka</em> (or proportionate distribution with the aid of these various quotients). In this manner it is possible to arrive even at the value of many component quantities of gold also.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the rule for arriving at (the weights of) gold (corresponding to two given <em>varṇas</em>) from (the known weight and <em>varṇa</em>of) the mixture of two (given specimensof) gold of (given) <em>varṇas</em>:-</p>
<ol start="183">
<li>Write down in inverse order the difference between the resulting <em>varṇa</em>and the higher (of the two given <em>varṇas</em>of the two component quantities of gold), and also the difference between the resulting <em>varṇa</em>and the lower (of the two given <em>varṇas</em>). The result arrived at by means of the operation of proportionate distribution (carried out with the aid of these inversely arranged differences), - that (result) gives the required (weights of the component quantities of) gold.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="184">
<li>If gold of 10 <em>varṇas</em>, on being combined with gold of 16 <em>varṇas</em>, produces as result 100 in weight of gold of 12 *varṇas,*give out separately (the measures in weight of) the two different varieties of gold.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (weights of) many (component quantities of) gold (of known <em>varṇas</em>in a mixture of known <em>varṇa</em>and weight):-</p>
<p>185<sup id="fnref:237"><a href="#fn:237" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">237</a></sup>. (In relation to all the known component <em>varṇas</em>) excepting one of them, optionally chosen weights may be adopted. Then what remains should be worked out as in relation to the previously given cases by means of the rule bearing upon the (determination of an) unknown weight of gold.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="186">
<li>The (given) <em>varṇas</em>(of the component quantities of gold) are 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 13 (respectively); and the resulting <em>varṇa</em>is in fact 9; and if (the total) weight (of all the component quantities) of gold be 60, what may be the several measures (in weight of the various component quantities) of gold ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the unknown <em>varṇas</em>of two (known quantities of gold when the resulting <em>varṇa</em>of the mixture is known) :-</p>
<ol start="187">
<li>Divide <em>one</em> (separately) by the two (given weights of) gold; multiply (separately each of the quotients thus obtained) by (the weight of) the (corresponding quantity of) gold and (also) by the resulting) <em>varṇa</em>; write down (both the products so obtained) in two (different) places; (each of these in each of the two sets,) if diminished and increased alternately by <em>one</em> as divided by (theknown weight of) the corresponding (variety of) gold, gives rise as a matter of course, to the required <em>varṇas</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>187</strong>. The rule will become clear by the following working of the problem in stanza 188:-</p>
<p>$\frac{1}{16}~ \times ~16~ \times ~D$ and $\frac{1}{10}~ \times ~10~ \times ~11$ are written down in two places thus:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>

      <tr>
          <td>11</td>
          <td>11</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Then $\frac{1}{16}$ and $\frac{1}{10}$ are added and subtracted alternately in each of the two sets thus:<br>
$11~ + ~\frac{1}{16} 11~ - ~\frac{1}{10}$} and {$11~ - ~\frac{1}{16} 11~ + ~\frac{1}{10}$. These give the two sets of answers.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="188">
<li>If, the (component) <em>varṇas</em>not being known, the resulting <em>varṇa</em>obtained by means of two (different kinds of) gold weighing 16 and10 (respectively) happens to be 11, what would be the (respective) <em>varṇas</em>of those two (different kinds of) gold ?</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the rule for arriving at the unknown <em>varṇas</em>of two (known quantities of gold, when the resulting <em>varṇa</em>of the mixture is known) :-</p>
<ol start="189">
<li>Choose an optional <em>varṇa</em>in relation to one (of the two given quantities of gold); what remains (to be found out) may then be arrived at as before. In relation to (the known quantities of all) the numerous varieties of gold excepting <em>one</em>, the <em>varṇas</em>are optional; then (proceed) as before.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="190">
<li>On fusing together (two different kinds of) gold which are 12 and 14 (respectively in weight), the resulting <em>varṇa</em>is made out to be 10. Think out and say (what) the <em>varṇas</em>of those two (kinds of gold are).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example to illustrate the latter half of the rule.</em></p>
<ol start="191">
<li>On fusing together 7, 9, 3, and 10 (in weight respectively of four different kinds) of gold, the resulting mixture turns out to be (gold of) 12 varnas. Give out the <em>varṇas</em>(of the various component kinds of gold) separately.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule regarding how to arrive at (an estimate of the value of) the test sticks (of gold) :-</p>
<ol start="192">
<li>The <em>varṇa</em>of every stick is to be separately divided by the (given) maximum <em>varṇa</em>, and (the quotients so obtained) are (all) to be added together. The resulting sum gives (the measure of) the required quantity of (pure) gold. From the summed up(weight of all the) sticks, this is to be subtracted. What remains is (the quantity of) the <em>prapūraṇikā</em> (that is, the quantity of the baser metal mixed).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>193-196$\frac{1}{2}$. (Three) merchants, well acquainted with the <em>varṇa</em>of gold, were desirous of making test sticks of gold, and produced (such) golden sticks. The gold of the first (merchant) was of 12 <em>varṇas</em>; (that of thesecond was of) 14 <em>varṇas</em>; and that of the third was of 16 <em>varṇas</em>. The (various specimens of the test sticks of) gold in the case of the first (merchant) were (regularly) less by 1 (in <em>varṇa</em>); those of the second were less by $\frac{1}{2}$and $\frac{1}{2}$; and those of the third were (in regular order) less by $\frac{1}{4}$. (The specimens of test gold) possessed by the first (merchant) began with that of (his) maximum <em>varṇa</em>and ended with that of 1 <em>varṇa</em>; (similarly, those of the second began with that of his maximum <em>varṇa</em>and) ended with that of 2<em>varṇas</em>; and those of the third merchant (began with that of his maximum <em>varṇa</em>and) ended with that of 3 <em>varṇas</em>. Every test stick is 1 <em>māṣa</em> in weight. 0 mathematician, if you indeed know gold calculation, tell me separately and soon what the measure of pure gold hereis, and what that of the baser metal mixed.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at (the different weights of) gold obtained in exchange and characterised by (two given) <em>varṇas</em>:-</p>
<p>197$\frac{1}{2}$. The two differences between, (firstly,) the product of the (given weight of) gold to be exchanged as multiplied by the (given) <em>varṇa</em>(thereof) and the product of the weight of gold obtained in exchange as multiplied by the(first of the two specified) <em>varṇas</em>(of the exchanged gold) - (and, secondly, between the first product above-mentioned and the product of the weight ofgold obtained in exchange as multiplied by the second of the specified <em>varṇas</em>of the exchanged gold - these two differences) have to be written down. If then, they are altered in position and divided by the difference between the (two specified) <em>varṇas</em>(of the two varieties) of the exchanged gold, the result happens to be the (two required) quantities (of the two kinds) of gold (obtained in exchange).</p>
<p><strong>197$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>. This rule will be clear from the following working of the problem given in stanza 198$\frac{1}{2}$:- 700×16−1008×10, and 1008×12−700 × 16 are altered in position and written down as 896 and 1120 ; and these, when divided by 12−10 or 2, give rise to the answers, namely, 448 and 560 in weight of gold of 10 and 12 varṇas respectively.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>198$\frac{1}{2}$. Seven hundred in weight of gold characterised by 16 <em>varṇas</em>produces, on being exchanged, 1,008 (in weight) of two kinds of gold characterised (respectively) by 12 and 10 <em>varṇas</em>. Now, what is the weight (of each of these two varieties) of gold?</p>
<p>The rule for finding out the (various weights of) gold obtained as the result of many (specified) kinds of exchange :-</p>
<p>199$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:238"><a href="#fn:238" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">238</a></sup>. If the (given) weight of gold (to be exchanged) as multiplied by the <em>varṇa</em>(thereof) is divided by (the quantity of) the desired gold (obtained in exchange), there arises the uniform average <em>varṇa</em>.

In the case of a man exchanging 300 in weight of gold characterised by 14 <em>varṇas</em>; the gold (obtained in exchange) is seen to be altogether 500 in weight, (the various parts whereof are respectively) characterised by 12, 10, 8 and 7 <em>varṇas</em>. What is the weight of gold separately corresponding to each of these (different) <em>varṇas</em>?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at (the various weights of) gold obtained in exchange which are characterised by known <em>varṇas</em>and are (definite) multiples in proportion :-</p>
<p>202-203. The sum of the (given) proportional multiple numbers is to be divided by the sum of the products (obtained) bymultiplying the (given proportional quantities of the various kinds of the exchanged) gold by (their respective specified) <em>varṇas</em>. (The resulting quotient) is to be multiplied by the original <em>varṇa</em>(of the gold to be exchanged). If by this product as diminished by <em>one</em>, the increase (in the weight of gold dueto exchange) is divided, and the quotient (so obtained) is subtracted from the original wealth of gold, the remaining (weight of unexchanged) gold is arrived at. This (weight of the unexchanged gold) is then to be subtracted from the sum (of the weight) of the original gold and the increase (in weight due to exchange). Then if the resulting remainder (here) is divided by the sum of the proportional multiplenumbers connected with the exchange, and is then multiplied by (each of those) proportional numbors (separately), the (various weights of) gold obtained in exchange and characterised by the specified <em>varṇas</em>and the specified proportions arearrived at.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>204- 205. There is a certain merchant desirous of obtaining profit; and the gold (in his possession) is of 16 <em>varṇas</em>and 200 in weight. A portion of it is exchanged in return for (four different kinds of) gold characterisedrespectively by 12, 8, 9 and 10 <em>varṇas,</em>(so that those varieties of gold are by weight) in proportions which begin with 1 and are then (regularly) multiplied by 2. The gain (in the weight of gold resulting out of this exehange transaction) is 102. What is the remaining (weight of the unexchanged) gold ? Tell me also the weights of gold obtained in exchange corresponding to those (above-mentioned <em>varṇas</em>).</p>
<p>Therule for arriving at (the weight of) the original (qnantity of) gold with the aid of the gold exchanged (in part), and with the aid (of the weight) of gold seen to be in excess (in consequence of the exchange) :-</p>
<ol start="206">
<li>Each specified part of (the original) gold (to be exchanged) is divided by the <em>varṇa</em>corresponding to its exchange. (The resulting quotient is in each case to be) multiplied by theoptionally chosen <em>varṇa</em>(of the originally given gold; and then all these products are to be added). From this sum, the sum of the (various) fractional (exchanged) parts (of the original gold) is to be subtracted. (If now) the observed excess (in the weight of gold dueto the exchange) is divided by this resulting remainder, what comes out here happens to be the original wealth of gold.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>207-208. A certain small ball of gold of 16 <em>varṇas</em>belonging to a merchant is taken; and $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ parts thereof are in order exchanged for (different kinds of) gold characterised (respectively) by 12, 10 and 9 <em>varṇas</em>. (The weights of these exchanged varieties of gold are) added to what remains (unexchanged) of theoriginal gold. Then 1,000 is observed to be in excess on removing from the account the weight of the original gold. What then is (the weight of this) original gold?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the desired <em>varṇa</em>with the help of the (mutual) gift of a desired fractional part of the gold (owned by the other), and also for arriving at the (weights of) gold (respectively) corresponding to those optionally gifted parts:-</p>
<p>209 to 212. <em>One</em> divided by (the numerical measure of each of two specifically gifted) parts is to be noted down in reverse order; and (if each of the quotients so obtained is) multiplied by anoptionally chosen quantity, (it) gives rise to (the weights of each of the two small) balls of gold. The <em>varṇa</em>(of each) of these (little balls of gold) as also that of the gold gifted by the other person (in the transaction) has to be arrived at as before with the aid of the (given) final average <em>varṇa</em>(in each case). It in this manner both sets of answers (arrived at) happen totally (with the requirements of the problem), the two <em>varṇas</em>arrived at in accordance with the previously adopted option become the verified <em>varṇas</em>mentioned in relation to the two (given) little balls of gold. If, (however, these answers do) not (tally), the <em>varṇas</em>belonging to the first set (of answers) have to be made (as the case may be) a little less or a little more; (then the average <em>varṇa</em>corresponding to these modified component <em>varṇas</em>has to be further obtained). Thereafter, the difference between this (average) <em>varṇa</em>and the previously obtained (untallying average) <em>varṇa</em>is written down; (and the required proportionate quantities) are (therefrom) derived by means of the operation of the Rule of Three: and the <em>varṇas</em>(arrived at according to the option chosen before, when respectively) diminished by one of these two quantities and increased by the other, turn out to be evidently the required <em>varṇas</em>(here).</p>
<p>209 - 212. The rule will be clear from the following working of the problem in 213-215:-<br>
Dividing 1 by $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$, weget respectively 2, 3; altering their position and multiplying them by any optionally chosen number, say 1, we get 3, 2. These two numbers represent the quantities of gold owned respectively by the two merchants.<br>
Choosing 9 as the <em>varṇa</em>of the gold owned by the first merchant, we can easily arrive, from the exchange proposed by him, at 13 as the <em>varṇa</em>of the gold owned by the second merchant. These <em>varṇas</em>, 9 and 13, give, in the exchange proposed by the second merchant, the average <em>varṇa</em>of $\frac{35}{3}$,while the average <em>varṇa</em>as given in the sum has to be 12 or $\frac{35}{3}$.<br>
Therefore the <em>varṇas</em>9 and 13 have to be altered. If 8 is chosen instead of 9, 13 has to be increased to 16 in the first exchange. Using these two <em>varṇas</em>, 8 and 16, in the second exchange, we obtain $\frac{30}{3}$ as the average <em>varṇa</em>, instead of $\frac{36}{3}$.</p>
<p>Thus, in the second exchange, wesee an increase of 40 - 35 or5 in the sumof the products of weight and <em>varṇa</em>, while the decrease and the increase in relation to the originally chosen <em>varṇas</em>aro 9 - 8 or 1 and 16 - 13 or 3.<br>
But the required increase in the sum of the products of weight and <em>varṇa</em>in the second exchangeis 36 - 35 or 1. Applying the Rule of Three, we get the Corresponding decrease and increase in the <em>varṇas</em>to be $\frac{1}{8}$ and $\frac{3}{5}$,<br>
Therefore, the <em>varṇas</em>are 9 - $\frac{1}{5}$ or 8$\frac{4}{5}$ and 13 + $\frac{3}{5}$ or 13$\frac{3}{5}$.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>213-215. Two merchants well versed in estimating the value of gold asked each other (for an exchange of gold). Then the first (of them) said to the other - &ldquo;If you give me half(of your gold), I shall combine that small pellet of gold with my own gold and make (the whole become gold of) 10 <em>varṇas</em>.&rdquo; Then this other said -&ldquo;If I only obtain your gold by one-third (thereof),I shall likewise make the whole (gold in my possession become gold of) 12 <em>varṇas</em>with the aid of the two pellets.&rdquo; O you, who know the secret of calculation, if you possess cleverness in relation to calculations bearing upon gold, tell me quickly, after thinking out well, the measures of the quantities of gold possessed by both of them, and also of the <em>varṇas</em>(of those quantities of gold).</p>
<p>Thus ends <em>Suvarṇa-kuṭṭīkāra</em> in the chapter on mixed problems</p>
<p><strong><em>Vicitra</em>-<em>kuṭṭīkāra</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound the <em>Vicitra-kuṭṭīkāra</em> in the chapter on mixed problems.</p>
<p>The rule in regard to (the ascertaining of) the number of truthful and untruthful statements (in a situation like the one given below wherein both are simultaneously possible):-</p>
<ol start="216">
<li>The number of men, multiplied by the number of those liked (among them) as increased by <em>one</em>, and (then) diminished by twice the number of men liked, gives rise to the number of untruthful statements. The square of the number representing all the men, diminished by the number of these (untruthful statements), gives rise to the statements that are truthful.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>216</strong>. The rationale of this rule will be clear from the following algebraical representation of the problem given in stanza 217 below :-<br>
Let <em>a</em> be the total number of persons of whom <em>b</em> are liked. The number of utterances is <em>a</em>, and each statement refers to <em>a</em> persons. Hence the total number of statements is <em>a</em>×<em>a<strong>o</strong>r**a</em>².<br>
Now, of these <em>a</em> persons, <em>b</em> are liked, and <em>a</em>−<em>b</em> are not liked. When each of the <em>b</em> number of persons is told—&ldquo;You alone areliked,&rdquo; the number of untruthfal statements in each case is <em>b</em>−1. Therefore, the total number of untruthful statements in <em>b</em> statements is <em>b</em>(<em>b</em>−1) . . . . . . . . . . I.</p>
<p>When, again, the same statement is made to each of the <em>a</em>−<em>b</em> persons, the number of untruthful statements in each case is <em>b</em>+1. Therefore, the totalnumber of untruthfal statements in <em>a</em>−<em>b</em> utterances is (<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)(<em>b</em>+1) . . . . . . . . . . . II.<br>
Adding I and II, we get <em>b</em>(<em>b</em>−1)+(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)(<em>b</em>+1)=<em>a</em>(<em>b</em>+1)−2<em>b</em>. This represents the total of untruthful statements; and on subtracting it from <em>a</em>², which is the measure of all the statements, truthfal and untruthful, wearrive obviously at the measure of the truthful statements.</p>

<p>The ruleregarding the (possible) varieties of combinations (among given things) :-</p>
<ol start="218">
<li>Beginning with <em>one</em> and inereasing by <em>one</em>, let the numbers going up to the given number of things be written down in regular order and in the inverse order (respectively) in an upper and a lower (horizontal) row.

</li>
<li>
<p>Algebraically, the formula given in the rule is:<br>
$x~ = \frac{\frac{aD}{2}~ - ~\sqrt{\left( \frac{aD}{2} \right)^{2}~ - ~abd~(D~ - ~d)}}{D~ - ~d}$,where x = wages to be found out, a =the total weight to be carried, D = the total distance, d the distance gone over, and b = the total wages promised. It may be noted here that the rate of the wages for the two stages of the journey is the same, although the amount paid for each stage of the journey is not in accordance with the promised rate for the whole journey.<br>
The formula is easily derived from the following equation containing the data in the problem :-<br>
$\frac{x}{ad}~ = ~\frac{b~ - ~x}{(a~ - ~x)(D~ - d)}$.</p>

<ol start="230">
<li>The distance (travelled over by the various numbers of men), are (respectively) to be dividedby the numbers of the men that are (doing the work of carrying) there. The quotients (so obtained) have to be combined so that the first (of them is taken at first separately and then) has (1, 2, and 3, etc., of) the following (quotients) added to it. (These quantities so resulting are to be respectively) multiplied by the numbers of the men that turn away (from the journey at the various stages.

<p>The rule for arriving at (the value of the money contents of) a purse which (when added to what is on hand with each of certain persons) becomes a specified multiple (of the sum of what is on hand with the others) :-</p>
<p>233-235. The quantities obtained by adding <em>one</em> to (each of the specified) multiple numbers (in the problem, and then)multiplying these sums with each other, giving up in each case the sum relating to the particular specified multiple, are to bereduced to their lowest terms by the removal of common factors. (These reduced quantities are then) to be added. (Thereafter) the square root (of this resulting sum) is to be obtained, from which <em>one</em> is (to be subsequently) subtracted. Then the reduced quantities referred to above are to be multiplied by (this) square root as diminished by <em>one</em>. Then these are to be separately subtracted from the sum of those same reduced quantities. Thus the moneys on hand with each (of the several persons) are arrived at. These (quantities measuring the moneys on hand) have to be added to one another, excluding from the addition in each casethe value of the money on the hand of one of the persons; and the several sums so obtained are to be written down separately. These are (thento be respectively) multiplied by (the specified) multiple quantities (mentioned above); from the several products so obtained the (already found out) values of the moneys on hand are (to be separately subtracted). Then the (same) value of the money in the purse is obtained (separately in relation to each of the several moneys on hand).</p>
<p><strong>233-235</strong>. In the problem given in 236-237. let <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em> represent the moneys on hand with the three merchants, and <em>u</em> the money in the purse.</p>
<p>Then <em>u</em>+<em>x</em>=<em>a</em>(<em>y</em>+<em>z</em>) , <em>u</em>+<em>y</em>=<em>b</em>(<em>z</em>+<em>x</em>) , <em>u</em>+<em>z</em>=<em>c</em>(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>) where a, b, c represent the multiples given in the problem. Now,<em>u</em>+<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>+<em>z</em>=(<em>a</em>+1)(<em>y</em>+<em>z</em>)</p>
<p>=(<em>b</em>+1)(<em>z</em>+<em>x</em>)</p>
<p>=(<em>c</em>+1)(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>).</p>
<p>Then, $\frac{(a~ + ~1)~(b~ + ~1)~(c~ + ~1)}{T}~ \times ~(y~ + ~z)~ = ~(b~ + ~1)~(c~ + ~1)$ &hellip;.&rsquo; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;I.<br>
where <em>T</em>=<em>u</em>+<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>+<em>z</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, $\frac{(a~ + ~1)~(b~ + ~1)~(c~ + ~1)}{T}~ \times ~(z~ + ~x)~ = ~(c~ + ~1)~(a~ + ~1)$&hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; II.</p>
<p>and $\frac{(a~ + ~1)~(b~ + ~1)~(c~ + ~1)}{T}~ \times ~(x~ + ~y)~ = ~(a~ + ~1)~(b~ + ~1)$&hellip;. &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;III.</p>
<p>Adding I, II and III,</p>
<p>$\frac{(a~ + ~1)~(b~ + ~1)~(c~ + ~1)}{T}~ \times ~2(x~ + ~y~ + ~z)~ = ~(b~ + ~1)~(c~ + ~1)~ + ~(c~ + ~1)~(a~ + ~1)~ + ~(a~ + ~1)~(b~ + ~1)~ = ~S$(say)

<p>∴<em>x</em>:<em>y</em>:<em>z</em> : :<em>S</em>−2(<em>b</em>+1)(<em>c</em>+1):<em>S</em>−2(<em>c</em>+1)(<em>a</em>+1):<em>S</em>−2(<em>a</em>+1)(<em>b</em>+1).</p>
<p>By removing the common factors, if any, in the right-hand side of the proportion, we get at the smallest integral values of <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>.</p>
<p>This proportion is given in the rule as the formula.</p>
<p>It may be noted that the square root mentioned in the rule has reference only to the problem given in the stanzas 236-237. Correctly speaking, instead of &ldquo;square root&rdquo;, we must have &lsquo;3&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It can be seen easily that this problem is possible only when the sum of any two of $\frac{1}{a~ + ~1},~\frac{1}{b~ + ~1},~\frac{1}{c~ + ~1}$ is greater than the third.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>236-237. Three merchants saw (dropped) on the way a purse (containing money). One (of them) said (to the others), &ldquo;If I secure this purse, I shall become twice as rich as both of you with your moneys on hand.&rdquo; Then the second (of them) said, &ldquo;I shall become three times as rich.&rdquo; Then the other, (the third), said, &ldquo;I shall become five times as rich.&rdquo; What is the value of the money in the purse, as also the money on hand (with each of the three merchants)?</p>
<p>The rule to arrive at the value of the moneys on hand as also the moneyin the purse (when particular specified fractions of this latter, added respectively to the moneys on hand with each of a given number of persons, make their wealth become in each case) the same multiple (of the sum of what is on hand) with all (the others) :-</p>

The resulting remainders constitute the several values of the moneys on hand. The value of the money in the purse is obtained by carrying out operations as before and then by dividing by any particular specified fractional part (mentioned in the problem).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>238</strong>. The formula given in the rule is -<br>

These values can be easily found out from the following equations :-<br>
<em>P**a</em>+<em>x</em>=<em>m</em>(<em>y</em>+<em>z</em>), <em>P**b</em>+<em>y</em>=<em>m</em>(<em>z</em>+<em>x</em>), and <em>P**c</em>+<em>z</em>=<em>m</em>(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>), where P is the money in the purse.</p>

O arithmetician, (you tell) me quickly what moneys these had on hand (respectively), and what the value of the money in the purse was.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measure of the money contents of a purse, when specified fractional parts (thereof added to what may be on hand with one among a number of persons) makes him a specified number of times (as rich as all the others with what they together have on hand) :-</p>
<ol start="241">
<li>
<p>The specified fractional parts relating to all others (than the person in view) are (reduced to a common denominator, which is ignored for practical purposes.

The resulting sums are (severally) divided each by its (corresponding specified) multiple quantity as increased by <em>one</em>. Then these quotients are also added. The several sums (so obtained in relationto the several cases) are diminished by the product of the particular specified fractional part as multiplied by the number of cases less by two.

<p>The rule for arriving at the money on hand, which, with the moneys begged (of others), becomes a specified multiple(of the money on band with the others): -</p>
<p>251$\frac{1}{2}$-252$\frac{1}{2}$. The sums of the moneys begged are multiplied each by its own corresponding multiple quantity as increased by <em>one</em>. With the aid of these (products) the moneys on hand are arrived at according to the rule given in stanza 241. These quantities (so obtained) are reduced so as to have a common denominator. Then they are (severally) divided by the sum as diminished by unity of the specified multiple quantities (respectively) divided by (those same) multiple quantities as increased by <em>one</em>. (The resulting quotients) themselves should be understood to be the moneys on hand with the various persons).</p>
<p><strong>251$\frac{1}{2}$-252</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically, $x~ - ~\left\{ ~\frac{(a~ + ~b)~(m~ + ~1)~ + ~m~(c~ + ~d)~(n~ + ~1)}{n~ + ~1}~ + ~\frac{(a~ + ~b)~(m~ + ~1)~ + ~m~(f~ + ~g)~(p~ + ~1)}{p~ + ~1}~ + ~&hellip;~ - ~(s~ - ~2)~(a~ + ~b)~(m~ + ~1)~ \right\}~ \div ~(m~ + ~1)\left. ~ \right\rbrack~ + ~\left( \frac{m}{m~ + ~1}~ + ~\frac{n}{n~ + ~1}~ + ~\frac{p}{p~ + ~1}~ - ~1 \right)$</p>
<p>Similarly for <em>y, z</em>, etc. Here <em>a, b, c, d, f, g</em>, are sums of money begged of each other.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>253$\frac{1}{2}$-255$\frac{1}{2}$;. Three merchants begged money from the hands of each other. The first begged 4 from the second and 5 from the third man, and became possessed of twice the money (then on hand with both the others). The second (merchant) begged 4 from the first and 6 from the third, and (thus) got three times the money (held on hand at the time by both the others together). The third man begged 5 from the first and 6 from the second, and (thus) became 5 times (as rich as the other two). O mathematician, if you know the mathematical process known as <em>citra-kuṭṭīkāra-miśra</em>, tell me quickly what may be the moneys they respectively had on hand.</p>
<p>256$\frac{1}{2}$-258$\frac{1}{2}$. There were three very clever persons. They begged money of each other. The first of them begged 12 from the second and 13 from the third, and became thus 3 times as rich as these two were then. The second of them begged 10 from the first and 13 from the third, and thus became 5 times as rich (as the other, two at the time). The third man begged 12 from the second and 10 from the first, and became (similarly) 7 times as rich. Their intentions were fulfilled. Tell me, O friend, after calculating, what might be the moneys on hand with them.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at equal capital amounts, on the last man giving (from his own money) to the penultimate man an amount equal to his own, (and again on this man doing the same in relation to the man who comes behind him, and so on) :-</p>
<p>259$\frac{1}{2}$. <em>One</em> divided by the optionally chosen multiple quantity (in respect of the amount of money to be given by the one to the other) becomes the multiple in relation to the penultimate man&rsquo;s amount. This (multiplier) increased by <em>one</em> becomes the multiplier of the amounts (in the hands) of the others. Theamount of the last person (so arrived at) is to have <em>one</em> added to it. This is the process to be adopted.</p>
<p><strong>259</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will be clear from the following working of the problem given in st. 263$\frac{1}{2}$:-<br>
$1~ \div ~\frac{1}{2}$ or 2 is the multiple with regard to the penultimate man&rsquo;s amount; this 2 combined with 1, i.e., 3 becomes the multiple in relation to the amounts of the others.</p>
<p>Now &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip;.. .1,1.</p>
<p>Multiplying the penultimate 1 by 2 and the other by 3, wo get &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &hellip;&hellip; 2, 3</p>
<p>Adding 1to the last&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. &hellip;&hellip;2, 4</p>
<p>Write down&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &hellip;&hellip;2, 4, 4</p>
<p>Multiply the penultimate 4 by 2, and the others by 3, and add 1 to the last &hellip; &hellip; 6, 8, 13.</p>
<p>Again &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; . 6, 8, 13, 13.</p>
<p>Repeating the same operations as above we get .. &hellip;18, 24, 26, 40, 54, 72, 78, 80, 121.</p>
<p>The figures in the last row represent the amounts in the hands of the 5merchants.<br>
Algebraically -<br>
$a~ - ~\frac{1}{2}b~ = ~\frac{3}{2}b~ - ~\frac{1}{2}c = ~\frac{3}{2}c~ - ~\frac{1}{2}d~ = ~\frac{3}{2}d~ - ~\frac{1}{2}f = ~\frac{3}{2}f$; where a, b, c, d, f, are the amounts on hand with the 5 merchants.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>260$\frac{1}{2}$-261$\frac{1}{2}$. Three sons of a merchant, the eldest, the middle, and the youngest, were going out along a road. The eldest son gave out of his capital amount to the middle son exactly as much as the capital amount of (that same) middleson. This middle son gave (out of his amount) to the last son just as much as he had. (In the end), they all became poseessed of equal amounts of money. O mathematician, think out and say what amounts they (respectively) had (with them) on hand (to start with).</p>
<p>262$\frac{1}{2}$. There were five sons of a merchant. From the eldest (of them) the one next to him obtained as much money as he himself had on hand. All others also did accordingly (each one giving to the brother next to him as much as he had on hand. In the end) they all became possessed of equal amounts of money. What were the amounts of money they (respectively) had on hand (to start with)?</p>
<p>263$\frac{1}{2}$. Five merchants became possessed of equal amounts of money after each of them gave out of his own property to the one who went before him half of what he possessed. Think out andsay what amounts of money they (respectively) had on hand (to start with).</p>
<p>264$\frac{1}{2}$. There were six merchants. The elder ones among them gave in order, out of what they respectively had on hand, to those who were next younger to them exactly two-thirds (of what they respectively had on hand). Afterwards, they all became possessed of equal amounts of money. What were the amounts of money they (severally) had on hand (to start with) ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at equal amounts of money on hand, after a number of persons give each to the others among them as much as they (respectively) have (then) on hand :-</p>
<p>265$\frac{1}{2}$. <em>One</em> is divided by the optionally chosen multiple quantity (in the problem). (To this), the number corresponding to the men (taking part in the transaction) is added. The first (man&rsquo;s) amount (on hand so start with is thus arrived at). This (and the results thereafter arrived at) are written down (in order), and each of them is multiplied by the optional multiple number as increased by <em>one</em> ; and the result is then diminished by <em>one</em>. (Thus the money on hand with each) of the others (to start with is arrived at).</p>
<p>Examples in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>266$\frac{1}{2}$. Each of three merchants gave to the others what each of these had on hand (at the time). Then they all became possessed of equal amounts of money. What are the amounts of money which they (respectively) had on hand (to start with) ?</p>
<p><strong>265</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will be clear from the following working of the problem given in st. 266$\frac{1}{2}$:-</p>
<p>1,divided by the optionally chosen multiple 1, and increased by the number of persons, 3, gives 4; this is the money in the hand of the first man.<br>
This 4, multiplied by the optionally chosen multiple, 1, as increased by 1, becomes 8; when 1 is subtracted from this, we get 7, which is the money on hand with the second person.<br>
This 7, again, treated as above, i.e., multiplied by 2 and then diminished by 1, gives 13, the money on hand with the third man.</p>
<p>This solution can be easily arrived at from the following equations:- 4(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>−<em>c</em>)=2{2<em>b</em>−(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>−<em>c</em>)−2<em>c</em>}=4<em>c</em>−2(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>−<em>c</em>)−{2<em>b</em>−(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>−<em>c</em>)−2<em>c</em>}.</p>
<p>267$\frac{1}{2}$. There were four merchants. Each of them obtained from the others half of what he had on hand (at the time of the respective transfers of money). Then they all becomepossessed of equal amounts of money. What is the measure of the money (they respectively had) on band (to start with) ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the gain derived (equally) from success and failure (in a gambling operation):-</p>
<p>268$\frac{1}{2}$-269$\frac{1}{2}$. The two sums of the numerators and denominators of the (two fractional multiple) quantities (given in the problem) have to be written down one below the other in the regular order,and (then) in the inverse order. The (summed up) quantities (in the first of these sets of two sums) are to be multiplied according to the <em>vajrāpavartana</em>process by the denominator, and (those in the second set) by the numerator, (of the fractional quantity) corresponding to the other (summed up quantity). The results (arrived at in relation to the first set) are written down in the form of denominators, and (those arrived at in relation to the second set are written down) in the form of numerators: (and the difference between the denominator and numerator in each set is noted down). Then by means of these differences the products obtained by multiplying (the sum of) the numerator and the donominator (of each of the given multiple fractions in the problem) with the denominator of the other are (respectively) divided. These resulting quantities, multiplied by the value of the desired gain, give in the inverse order the measure of the moneys on hand (with the gamblers to stake).</p>
<p>268$\frac{1}{2}$-269$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically, $x~ = ~\frac{(c~ + ~d)~b}{\left( c~ + ~d~b~ - ~(a~ + ~b)~c \right.}~ \times ~p$, and $y~ = ~\frac{(a~ + ~b)~d}{(a~ + ~b)~d~ - ~(c~ + ~d)~a}~ \times ~p$, where <em>x</em>and <em>y</em> are the moneys on hand with the gamblers, and $\frac{a}{b},~\frac{c}{d}$, the fractional parts taken from them, and <em>p</em> the gain. This follows from $x~ - ~\frac{c}{d}y~ = ~p~ = ~y~ - ~\frac{a}{b}x$.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>270-272$\frac{1}{2}$. A great man possessing powers of magical charm and medicinesaw a cock-fight going on, and spoke separately in confidential language to both the owners of the cocks. He said to one: &ldquo;If your bird wins, then you give the stake-money to me. If, however, you prove unvictorious, I shall give you two-thirds of that stake money then.&rdquo; He went to (the owner of) the other (cock) and promised to give three-fourths (of his stake-money on similar conditions). From both of them the gain to him could be only 12 (gold-pieces in each case). You tell me, Oernament on the forehead of mathematicians, the (values of the) stake-money which (each of) the cock-owners had on hand.</p>
<p>The rule for separating the (unknown) dividend number, thequotient, and thedivisor from their combined sam :-<br>
273$\frac{1}{2}$. Any (suitable optionally chosen) number (which has to be) subtracted from the (given) combined sum happens to be the divisor (in question). On dividing, by this (divisor) as increased by <em>one</em>, the remainder (left after subtracting the optionally chosen number from the given combined sum), the (required) quotient is arrived at. The very same remainder (above mentioned), as diminished by (this) quotient becomes the (required dividend) number.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>274$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain unknown quantity is divided by a certain (other) unknown quantity. The quotient here as combined with the divisor and the dividend number is 53. What is that divisor, and what (that) quotient ?</p>
<p>Therule for arriving at that number, which becomes a square either on adding a known number (to the original number), or on subtracting (another) given number (from that same original number):-</p>
<p>275$\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of the quantity to be added and the quantity to be subtracted is multiplied by <em>one</em> as associated with whatever may happen to be the excess above the even number (nearest to that sum). The resulting product is (then) halved and (then) squared. (From this squared quantity), the (above-referred to possible) excess quantity is subtracted. The result is divided by <em>four</em>, and then combined with <em>one</em>. Then the resulting quantity is either added to or subtracted from (respectively) by the half of the difference between the two given quantities as diminished or increased by the odd-making excess quantity (above referred to) according as the original given quantity to be subtracted is greater or less than the original given quantity to be added. The result arrived at in this mauner happens to be the (required) number, which (when associated as desired with the (given) quantities) surely yields the square root (exactly).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>276$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain number when increased by 10 or decreased by 17 yields an exact square root. If possible, O arithmetician, tell me quickly that number.</p>
<p>277$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain quantity either as diminished by 7, or as added to by 18, yields the square root exactly. O arithmetician, give it out after calculation.</p>
<p>278$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain quantity diminished by $\frac{2}{3}$, or again that same (quantity) increased by $\frac{3}{7}$, yields the square root (exactly). Tell me that quantity quickly, Oarithmetician, after thinking out what it may be.</p>
<p><strong>275</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically, let <em>x</em>be the quantity to be found out, and <em>a, b</em>, the respective quantities to be added to or subtracted from it;then, the forumla to represent the rule will be $\left\{ \frac{(a~ + ~b)~ + ~(1~ + ~1)~ \div ~2}{4} \right\}^{2}~ - ~\frac{1}{}~ + ~1~ \pm ~\frac{\left. a~ \right.\sim~b~ \pm ~1}{2}$. The rationale of this may be made out thus:-<br>
(<em>n</em>+1)²−<em>n</em>²=2<em>n</em>+1, an odd number; and (<em>n</em>+2)²−<em>n</em>²=4<em>n</em>+4, an even number;where n is any integer.</p>
<p>From 2<em>n</em>+1, or 4<em>n</em>+4, the rule shows how we may arrive at <em>n</em>²+<em>a</em> when we know<br>
2<em>n</em>+1,<em>o**r</em>4<em>n</em>+4, to be equal to <em>a</em>+<em>b</em>.</p>
<p><strong>278</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Since the quantities represented by <em>b</em> and a in the note on stanza 275$\frac{1}{2}$ are seen to be fractional in this problem, being actually $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{7}$,it is necessary to have these fractional quantities removed from the process of working out the problem in accordance with the given rule. For this purpose they are first reduced to the same denominator, and come to be represented by $\frac{14}{21}$ and $\frac{9}{21}$ respectively; then these quantities are multiplied by (21)², so as to yield 294 and 189, which are assumed to be the <em>b</em> and the <em>a</em> in the problem. The result arrived at with these assumed values of <em>b</em> and <em>a</em> is divided by (21)², and the quotient is taken to be the answer of the problem.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the square root of (an unknown) number as increased or diminished by a known number :-</p>
<p>279$\frac{1}{2}$. The known quantity which is given is first halved and (then) squared and then <em>one</em> is added (to it). The resulting quantity, either when increased by the desired given quantity or when diminished by the (same) quantity yields the square root (exactly).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>280$\frac{1}{2}$. Here is a number which, when increased by 10 or diminished by the same 10, yields an exact square root. Think out and tell me that number, O mathematician.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the two required square quantities, with the aid of those required quantities as multiplied by a known number, and also with the aid of (the same known number as forming the value of) the square root of the difference (between these products) :-</p>
<p>281$\frac{1}{2}$. The given number is increased by <em>one</em>; and the given number is also diminished by <em>one</em>. The resulting quantities when halved and then squared give rise to the two (required) quantities. Then if these be (separately) multiplied by the given quantity, the squre root of the difference between these (products) becomes the given quantity.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>282$\frac{1}{2}$-283. Two unknown squared quantities are multiplied by 71. The square root of the difference between these (two resulting products)is also 71. O mathematician, if you know the process of calculation known as <em>citra-kuṭṭīkāra</em>, calculate and tell me what (those two unknown) quantities are.</p>
<p>279$\frac{1}{2}$. This is merely particular case of the rule given in stanza 275$\frac{1}{2}$wherein <em>a</em> is taken to be equal to <em>b</em>.<br>
281$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically, when the given number is $d,~\left( \frac{d~ + ~1}{2} \right)^{2}$ and $\left( \frac{d~ - ~1}{2} \right)^{2}$ are the required square quantities.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the required increase or decrease in relation to a given multiplicand and a given multiplier (so as to arrive at a given product):-</p>
<ol start="284">
<li>The difference between the required product and the resulting product (of the given multiplicand and the multiplier) is written down in two places. To (one of) the factors (of the resulting product) <em>one</em> is added, and (to the other) the required product is added. That (difference written above in two positions as desired) is (severally) divided in the inverse order by the sums (resulting thus). These give rise to the quantities that are to be added (respectively to the given multiplicand and the, multiplier) or (to the quantities that are) to be (respectively) subtracted (from them).</li>

<li>To dividewhere there has been a multiplication, to multiply where there has been a division, to subtract where there has been an addition, to get at the square root where there has been a squaring, to get at the squaring where the root has been given - this is the process of working backwards.</li>

<ol start="288">
<li>Add <em>three</em> to the number of arrows forming the circumferential layer; then square this (resulting sum) and add again <em>three</em> (to this square quantity). If this be further divided by 12, the quotient becomes the number of arrows to be found in the bundle.</li>

</ol>
<p>Thus ends <em>vicitra-kuṭṭīkāra</em> in the chapter on mixed problems.</p>
<p><strong>288</strong>. The formula here given to find out the total number of arrows is $\frac{(n~ + ~3)^{2}~ + ~3}{12}$,where <em>n</em> is the number of circumferential arrows. This formula can be arrived at from the following considerations. It can be proved geometrically that only six circles can be described round another circle, all of them being equal and each of them touching its two neighbouring circles as well as the central circle; that, round these circles again, only twelve circles of the same dimension can be described similarly;and that round these again, only 18 such circles are possible, and so on. Thus, the first round has 6 circles, the second 12, the third 18, and so on. So that the number of circles in any round, say <em>p</em>, is equal to 6 <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Now, the total number of circles in the given number of rounds <em>p</em>, calculated from the central cirale, is $1~ + ~1~ \times ~6~ + ~2~ \times ~6~ + ~3~ \times ~6~ + ~&hellip;~ + ~p~ \times ~6~ = ~1 + ~6~\left( 1~ + ~2~ + ~3~ + ~&hellip;~ + ~p \right)~ = ~1~ + ~6\frac{p(p~ + ~1)}{2}~ = ~1~ + ~3p~(p~ + ~1)$. If the value of <em>6p</em> is given, say, as <em>n</em>, the total number of circles is $1~ + ~3~ \times ~\frac{n}{6}~\left( \frac{n}{6}~ + ~1 \right)$, which is easily reducible to the formula given at the beginning of this note.</p>
<p><strong>Summation of Series.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound in (this) chapter on mixed problems the summation of quantities in progressive series.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the sum of a series in arithmetical progression, of which the common difference is either positive or negative:-</p>
<ol start="290">
<li>The first term is either decreased or increased by the product of the negative or the positive common difference and the quantity obtained by halving the number of terms in the series as diminished by one.

<li>The first term is 14; the negative common difference is 3; the number of terms is 5. The first term is 2; the positive common difference is 6; and the number of terms is 8. What is the sum of the series in (each of) these cases?</li>

<li>Divide the (given) sum of the series by the number of terms (therein), and subtract (from the resulting quotient) the product obtained by multiplying the common difference by the half of the number of terms in the series as diminished by <em>one</em>. (Thus) the first term (in the series) is arrived at. The sum of the series is divided by the number of terms (therein).

<p>Below these syllables, write down the terms of a series in geometrical progression, having 1 as the first term and 2as the common ratio. Add the figures 4 and 1 under the short syllables, and increuse the sum by 1; we get 6: and we, therefore, say that this is the sixth variety in the<br>
tri-syllabicmetre.</p>
<p>(5) Suppose the problem is: How many varieties contain 2 short syllables ? Write down the natural numbers in the regular and in the inverse order, one below the other thus:<figure class="">

 .Taking two terms from right to left, both from above and from below, we divide the product of the former by the product of the Iatter. And the quotient 3 is the answer required.</p>
<p>(6) It is prescribed that the symbolsrepresenting the long and short syllablesof any variety of metre should occupy an <em>aṅgula</em> of vertical space, and that the intervening space between any two varieties should also be an <em>aṅgula</em>. The amount, therefore, of vertical space required for the 8 varieties of this metre is 2 x 8 - 1 or 15 <em>aṅgulas</em>.</p>
<p>The arrangement (of short and long syllables in all the varieties of stanzas so obtained) is shown to be arrived at thus:-</p>
<p>(The natural numbers commencing with <em>one</em> and ending with the measure of the maximum number of possible stanzas in the given metre being noted down), every odd number (therein) has <em>one</em> added to it, and is (then) halved. (Whenever this process is gone through), a long syllable is decidedly indicated. Wherethe number is even, it is (immediately) halved and this indicates ashort syllable. In this manner, the process (of halving with or without the addition of <em>one</em> as the case may be, noting down at the same time the corresponding long and short syllables as indicated), is to be regularly carried on(till the actual number of syllables in the metre is arrived at in each case).</p>
<p>(If the number representing in the natural order any given variety of a stanza), the arrangement of the syllables wherein has to be found out, (happens to be even, it) bas to be halved, and indicates a short syllable. (If it happens to be however odd),<em>one</em> has to be added to it, and (then) it is to be halved: and this indicates a long syllable. Thus (the long and short syllables have to be put down over and over again (in their respective positions), till the maximum number of syllables in the stanza is arrived at. This gives the arrangement (of long and short syllables in the required variety of the stanza).</p>
<p>Where (a stanza of a particular variety is given, and) its ordinal position (among the varieties of stanzas possible in the metre) is to be found out, the terms (of a series in geomotrical progression) commencing with <em>one</em> and having <em>two</em> as the common ratio are written down, (the number of terms in the series being equal to the number of syllables in the given metre. Above these terms, the corresponding long or short syllables are noted down). Then the terms (immediately) below the position of short syllables are all added; the sum (so obtained) is increased by <em>one</em>. (This gives the required ordinal number.)</p>
<p>Natural numbers commencing with <em>one</em>, and going up to the number (of syllables in the given metre), are written down in the regular and in the inverse (order in two rows) one below the other. When the numbers in the row are multiplied (1, 2, 3 or more at a time) from the right to the left, and the products (so obtained in relation to the upper row) are divided by the (corresponding) products (in relation to the lower row), the quotient represents the result of the operation intended to arrive at (the number of varieties of stanzas in the given metre, with 1, 2, 3 or more) short or long syllables (in the verse).</p>
<p>The possible number (of the varieties of stanzas in the given metre) is multiplied by two and (then) diminished by one. This result gives (the measure of what is called) <em>adhvan</em>, (wherein an interval equivalent to a stanza is conceived to exist between every two successive varieties in the metre).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>337$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to the metre made up of 3 syllables, tell me quickly the six things to be known-viz., (1) the (maximum) number (of possible stanzas in the metre), (2) the manner of arrangement (of the syllables in those stanza), (3) the arrangement of the syllables (in a given variety of the stanza, the ordinal position whereof among the possible varieties in the metre is known), (4) the ordinal position (of a given stanza), (5) the number (of stanzas in the given metre containing any given mumber) of short or long syllables, and (6) the (quantity known as) <em>adhvan</em>.</p>

<p>CALCULATION RELATING TO THE MEASUREMENT<br>
OF AREAS.</p>
<ol>
<li>For the accomplishment of the object held in view, I bow again and again with true earnestness to the most excellent Siddhas who have realized the knowledge of all things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound the sixth variety of calculation forming the subject known by the name of the Measurement of Areas. And that is as follows:-</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>(The measurement of) area has been taken to be of two kinds by Jina in accordance with (the nature of) the result, namely, that which is (approximate) for practical purposes and that which is minutely accurate. Taking this into consideration, I shall clearly explain this subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Mathematical) teachers, who have reached the other shore of the ocean of calculation, have given out well (the various kinds of) areas as consisting of those that are trilateral, quadrilateral and curvi-linear, being differentiated into their respective varieties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trilateral area is differentiated in three ways; a quadriIateral one in five ways; and a curvi-linear one in eightways. All the remaining (kinds of) areas are indeed variations of thevarieties of these (different kinds of areas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learned men say that the trilateral areamay be equilateral, isosceles or scalene, and that the quadrilateral areaalso may beequi-lateral, equi-dichastic, equi-bilateral, equi-trilateral and in-equi-lateral.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5 and 6</strong>. The various kinds of enclosed areas mentioned in these stanzas are illustrated below:-<br>

<p>From consideration of the rules given for the measurement of the dimensions and areas of quadrilateral figures, it has to be concluded that all the quadrilateral figures mentioned in this chapter are cyclic. Hence an equilatoral quadrilateral is a square, an equidichastic quadrilateral is an oblong;and equililateral and equi-trilateral quadrilaterals have their topside parallel to the base.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation relating to approximate measurement<br>
(of areas).</strong></p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (approximate) measure of the areas of trilateral and quadrilateral fields :-</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The product of the halves of the sums of the opposite sides becomes the(quantitative) measurement (of the area) of trilateral and quadrilateral figures. In the case of (a figure constituting a circular annulus like) the rim of a wheel, half of the sum of the (inner and outer) circumferences multiplied by (the measure of) the breadth (of the annulus gives the quantitative measure of the area thoreof). Half of this result happens to be there the area of (a figure resembling) the crescent moon.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>In the case of a trilateral figure, 8 <em>daṇḍas</em>happen to be the measure of the side, the opposite side and the base; tell me quickly, after calculating, the practically approximate value (of the area) thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a trilateral figure with two equal sides, the length (represented by the two sides) is 77 <em>daṇḍas</em>; and the breadth (measured by the base) is 22 <em>daṇḍas</em>associated with 2 <em>hastas</em>. (Find out the area.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7</strong>. A trilateral figure is here conceived to be formed by making the topside, i.e., the side opposite to the base, of a quadrilateral so small as to be neglected. Then the two Iateral sides of the trilateral figure become the opposite sides, the topside being taken to be nil in value. Hence it is that the rule speaks of opposite sides even in the case of a trilateral figare.</p>
<p>As half the sum of the two sides of a triangle is, in all cases, bigger than the altitude, the value of the area arrived at according to this rulecannot be accurate in any instance.</p>
<p>In regard to quadrilateral figures the value of the area arrived at according to this rule can be accurate in the case of a square and an oblong, but only approximate in other cases.</p>
<p><em>Nēmi</em> is the area enclosed between the circumferences of two concentric circles; and the rulehere statedfor finding out the approximatemeasure of the area of a <em>Nēmikṣētra</em> happens to give the accurate measurethereof.</p>
<p>In the case of a figure resembling the crescent moon, it is evident that the resultarrived ataccording to the rule gives only an approximate measure of the area.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>In the case of a scalene trilateral figure, one side is 13 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the opposite side is 15 <em>daṇḍas</em>; and the base is 14 <em>daṇḍas</em>. So what is the quantitative measure (of the area) of this (figure) ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a figure resembling (the medial longitudinal section of) the tusk of an elephant, the leagth of the outer curve is seen to be 88 <em>daṇḍas</em>; that of the inner curve is (seen to be) 72 <em>daṇḍas</em>; the measure of (the thickness at) the root of the tusk is 30 <em>daṇḍas</em>. (What is the measure of the area?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an equilateral quadrilateral figure, the sides and the opposite sides (whereof) are each 60 <em>daṇḍas</em>in measure, you tell me quickly, O friend, the resulting (quantitative) measure (of the area thereof).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a longish quadrilateral figure here, the length is 61 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the breadth is 32. Give out the practically approximate measure (of the area thereof).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a quadrilateral with two equal sides, the length (as measured along either of the equal sides) is 67 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the breadth of this figure is 38 <em>daṇḍas</em>(at the base) and 33 <em>daṇḍas</em>(at the top. What is the measure of the area of the figure ?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a quadrilateral figure with three equal sides, (each of these) three sides measures 108 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the (remaining sidehere called) <em>mukha</em> or top-sidemeasures 8 <em>daṇḍas</em>and 3 <em>hastas</em>. Accordingly, tell me, 0 mathematician (the measure of the area of this figure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a quadrilateral the sides of which are all unequal, the side forming the base measures 38 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the side forming the top is 32 <em>daṇḍas</em>: one of the lateral sides is 50 <em>daṇḍas</em>and the other is 60 <em>daṇḍas</em>. What is (the area) of this (figure) ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an annulus, the inner circular boundary measures 30 <em>daṇḍas</em>; the outer circular boundary is seen to be 300. The breadthof the annulus is 45. What is the calculated measure of the area of (this) annulus ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>11</strong>. The shape of the figure mentioned in this stanza seems to be what is given here in the margin: it is intended that this should be treatedas a trilateral figare, and that the area thereof should be found out in accordance with the rule given in relation to trilateral figures.<figure class="">

<ol start="18">
<li>In the case of a figure resembling the crescent moon, the breadth is seen to be2 <em>hastas</em>, the outer curve 68 <em>hastas</em>, and the inner curve 32 <em>hastes</em>. Say what the (resulting) area is.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (practically approximatevalue of the), area of the circle :-</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>The (measure of the) diameter multiplied by <em>three</em> is the measure of the circumference; and the number representing the square of half the diameter, if multiplied by <em>three</em>, gives the(resulting) area in the case of a complete circle. Teachers say that, in the case of a semicircle, half (of these) give (respectively) the measure (of the circumference and of the area).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="20">
<li>In the case of a circle, the diameter is 18. What is the circumference, and what the (resulting) aron (thereof) ?In the case of a semicircle, the diameter is 18: tell me quickly what the calculated measure is (of the area as well as of the circumference).</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at (the value of) the area of an elliptical figure :-</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>The longer diameter, increased by half of the (shorter) diameter and multiplied by <em>two</em>, gives the measure of the circumference of the elliptical figure. One-fourth of the (shorter) diameter, multiplied by the circumference, gives rise to the (measure of the) area (thereof).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>19</strong>. The approximate character of the measure of the circumference as well as of the area as given here is due to the value of <em>π</em> being taken as 3.</p>
<p><strong>21</strong>. The formulagiven for the circumference of an ellipse is evidently an approximation of a different kind. The area of an ellipse is <em>π</em>. a.b, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>are the semi-axes. If<em>π</em>is taken to be equal to 3, then <em>π</em>. a.b, = 3 a.b. But the formula given in the stanza makes the area equal to 2<em>a**b</em>+<em>b</em>².</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="22">
<li>In the case of an elliptical figure the (shorter) diameter is 12, and the longer diameter is 36. What is the circumference and what is the (resulting) area (thereof)?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (resulting) area of a conchiform curvilinear figure :-</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>In the case of a conchiform curvilinear figure, the measure of the (greatest) breadth diminished by halfthe measure of the mouth and multiplied by <em>three</em> gives the measure of the perimeter. One-third of the square of half (this) perimeter, increased by three-fourths of the square of half the measure of the mouth, (gives the area).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="24">
<li>In the case of a conchi-form figure the breadth is 18 <em>hastas</em>, and the measure of the mouth thereof is 4 (<em>hastas</em>). You tell me what the perimeter is and what the caloulated area is.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (resulting) area of the concave and convex circular surfaces:-</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Understand that <em>one-fourth</em> of the circumference multiplied by the diameter gives rise to the calculated (resulting) area. Thence, in the case of concave and convex areas like that of asacrificial fire-pit and like that of (the back of) the tortoise, (the required result is to be arrived at).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>23</strong>. If<em>a</em> is the diameter and <em>m</em> is the measure of the month, then $3\left( a~ - ~\frac{1}{2}~m \right)$ is the mesure of the circumference; and $\left\{ ~\frac{3~\left( a~ - ~\frac{1}{2}m \right)}{2}~ \right\}^{2}~ \times ~\frac{1}{3}~ + ~\frac{3}{4}~ \times ~\left( \frac{m}{2} \right)^{2}$is the measure of the area. The exact shape of the figure is not clear from the description given; but from the values given for the circumference and the area, it may be conceived to consist of 2 unequal semicircles placed so that their diameters coincide in position as shown in figure 12, given in the foot-note to stanza 6, in this chapter.</p>
<p><strong>25</strong>. The area here specified seems to be that of the surface of the segment of a sphere; and the measure of the area is stated to be, when symbolically represented, equal to $\frac{c}{4}~ \times ~d$, where <em>c</em> is the circumference of the sectional circle, and <em>d</em> is the diameter thereof. But the area of the surface of a spherical segment of this kind is equal to 2.<em>π</em>.r.h, where <em>r</em> is the radius of the sectional circle and <em>h</em>is the height of the spherical segment.</p>
<p><em>As example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="26">
<li>In the case of the area of a sacrificial fire-pit the measure of the diameter is 27, and the measure of the circumference is seen to be 56. What is the calculated measure of the area of that same (pit)?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example about a convex circular surface resembling (the<br>
back) of a tortoise.</em></p>
<ol start="27">
<li>The diameter is 15, and the circumference is seen to be 36. In the case of this area resembling the (back of a) tortoise, what is the practically approximate measure as calculated ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the practically approximate value of the area of an in-lying annular figure as well as of an out-reaching annular figure :-</p>
<p>28<sup id="fnref:244"><a href="#fn:244" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">244</a></sup>. The (inner) diameter increased by the breadth (of the annular area) when multiplied by <em>three</em> and by the breadth (of the annular area) gives the calculated measure of the area of the outreaching annular figure. (Similarly the measure of the calculated area) of the in-lying annular figure (is to be obtained) from the diameter as diminished by the breadth (of the annular area).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="29">
<li>The diameter is 18 <em>hastas</em>, and the breadth of the out-reaching annular area is 3 in this case: the diameter is 18 <em>hastas</em> and again the breadth of the in-lying annular area is 3 <em>hastas</em>. What may be (the area of the annular figure in each case) ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving separately at the numerical measures of the circumference, of the diameter, and of the area of a circularfigure, from the combined sum obtained by adding together the approximate measure of its area, the measure of its circumference and the measure of its diameter:-</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>In relation to the combined sum (of the three quantities) as multiplied by 12, the quantity thrown in so as to be added is 64. Of this (second) sum the square root diminished by the squareroot of the quantity thrown in gives rise to the measure of the circumference.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="31">
<li>The combined sum of the measures of the circumference, of the diameter and of the area (of a circle) is 1116. Tell me what the (measure of the) circumference is, what (that of) the calculated area and what (of) the diameter is.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the practically approximatevalue of surface-areas resembling (the longitudinal sections of) the<em>yava</em> grain, (of) the <em>mardala</em>, (of) the <em>paṇava</em>, and (of) the <em>vajra</em> :-</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>In the case of areas shaped in the form of the <em>yava</em> grain, of the <em>muraja</em>, of the <em>paṇava</em>and of the <em>vajra</em>, the(required measurement of) area is that which results by multiplying half the sum of the end measure and the middle measure by the length.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>30</strong>. This rule will be clear from the following algebraical representation :-</p>
<p>Let <em>c</em>be the circumference of the circle. As<em>π</em> is taken to be equal to 3, $\frac{c}{3}$ is the diameter and $3\frac{c^{2}}{36}$ is the area of the circle. If <em>m</em> stands for the combined sum of the circumference, the diameter and the area of the circle, then the rule given in the stanza to the effect that $c~ = ~\sqrt{12m~ + ~64}~ - ~\sqrt{64}$may be easily arrived at from the quadratic equation containing the data in the problem:-
$c~ + ~\frac{c}{3}~ + ~3\frac{c^{2}}{36}~ = ~m$.</p>
<p><strong>32</strong>. <em>Muraja</em> means the same thing as mardala and <em>mṛdaṅga</em>. The shape of the various figures mentioned in this states is as follows:<br>
<figure class="">

    </a>

    

</figure>
</p>
<p>The measures of the area arrived at according to the rule given in this stanza are approximately correct in the case of all the figures, as the rule is based on the assumption that each of the bounding curved lines may be taken to be equal to the sum of two straight lines formed by joining the ends of the curves with the middle point thereof.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="33">
<li>
<p>In the case of an area resembling the configuration of a <em>yava</em>grain, the length is 80 and the breadth in the middle is 40. Tell me, what may be the calculated measure of that area ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell (me what may be the calculated measure of the area) in relation to a field which has the outline configuration of the<em>mṛdaṅga</em>, and of which the length is 80 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the end measure is 20 and the middle measure is 40 <em>daṇḍas</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a field having the outline of the <em>paṇava</em>, the length is 77 <em>daṇḍas</em>, the measure of each of the two ends is 8 <em>daṇḍas</em>, and the measure in the middle is 4 <em>daṇḍas</em>. (What is the measure of the area ?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly in the case of a field having the outline of the vajra, the length is 96 <em>daṇḍas</em>, in the middle there is the middle point; and at the ends the measure is $13\frac{1}{3}$<em>daṇḍas</em>. (What is the measure of the area ?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measure of areas such as the <em>ubhaya-niṣēdha</em> or di-deficient area :-</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>On subtracting the product of the length into half the breadth from the product of the length into the breadth, youdeclare the measure of the di-deficient area. That which is less (than the latter product here) by half of this (above-mentioned quantity to be subtracted) is the measure of the area of theuni-deficient figure.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>37</strong>. The figures mentioned in this stanza are those given below:-</p>
<p>These are looked upon as being derived from aquadrilateral figure which is divided into four triangles by means of its diagonals crossing each other. Thedi-deficient figure is that in which any two of the opposite triangles out of the four making up the quadrilateral are left out of consideration, the uni-deficient figure being that in which only one out of the four triangles is neglected.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="38">
<li>The length is 36, and the breadth is only 18 <em>daṇḍas</em>. What is the resulting measure of the area in the case of a di-deficient area, and what in the case of the uni-deficient area ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the practically approximate measure of the areaof fields resembling the outline of a multiplex <em>vajra</em> :-</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>One-third of the square of half the perimeter, divided by the number of sides and (then) multiplied by the number of sides as diminished by <em>one</em>, gives indeed in the result the value of the area of all figures made up of sides. In the case of the areaincluded between circles (in contact), one-fourth (of the result thus arrived at gives the required measure).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>39</strong>. The rule stated in this stanza given the area of figures made up of any number of sides. If<em>s</em> is half the sum of the measures of the sides, and <em>n</em> the number of sides, the area is said to be equal to $\frac{s^{2}}{3}~ \times ~\frac{n~ - ~1}{n}$. Thisformula is found to give the approximate value of the area in the case of triangle, a quadrilateral, hexagon and a circle conceived as a figure of Infinite number of sides. The other part of the rule deals with the interspace bounded by parts of circles in contact, and the value of the area arrived at according to the rule here given is also approximate. The figure below shows an interspace so bounded by four touching circles.</p>

<p>The rule for arriving at the practically approximatearea of a field resembling a bow in outline :-</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>In the case of a bow-shaped field the calculated measure (of the area) is obtained by adding together (the measure of) the arrow and (that of the string and multiplying the sum by half (the measure) of the arrow. The square root of the square of the (measure of the) arrow as multiplied by 5 and (then) as combined with the square of the (measure of the) string gives the (measure of the bent) stick (of the bow).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>43</strong>. The field resembling a bow in outline is in fact the segment of a circle,the bow forming the arc, the bow-string forming the chord, and the arrow measuring the greatest perpendicular distance between the arcand the chord. If a, c, and p represent the lengths of these three lines, then, according to the rules given in stanzas 43 and 45 -<br>
Area$= ~(c~ + ~p)~ \times ~\frac{p}{2}$</p>
<p>Length of bow $= ~\sqrt{5p^{2}~ + ~c^{2}}$</p>
<p>Length of arrow $= ~\sqrt{\frac{a^{2}~ - ~c^{2}}{5}}$</p>
<p>Length of bow-string $= ~\sqrt{a^{2}~ - ~5p^{2}}$</p>
<p>For accurate value are stanzas 73$\frac{1}{2}$ and 74$\frac{1}{2}$in this chapter.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="44">
<li>A bow-shaped field is seen whereof the string-measureis26, and the arrow-measure is 13. Tell me quickly, Omathematician, what the calculated measure of this (area) is, and what the measure of this (bent) stick (curve).</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the arrow-measure as well as the string-measure (in relation to a bow-shaped field) :-</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>The difference between the squares of the string and of the bent bow is divided by 5. The square root (of the resulting quotient) gives the intended measure of the arrow. The square of the arrow is multiplied by 5; and (this product) is subtracted from the square (of the arc) of the bow. The square root (of the resulting quantity) gives the measure corresponding to the string.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="46">
<li>In the case of this (already given bow-shaped) field the measure of the arrow is not known; and in the case of another (similar field) the measure of the string is not known. O you who know calculation, give out both these measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the practically approximate value of the area of the circle which is circumscribed about or inscribed within a four-sided figure :-</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>Half of three times (the measure of the area of the inscribed quadrilateral figure) gives the measure of the area of the circle in the case in which it is circumscribed outside. In the case whereit is inscribed within and the quadrilateral is the other way (i.e., escribed), half of the above measure (is the required quantity).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>47</strong>. The formula here given may be seen to be accurate in the case of a square, but only approximate in the case of other quadrilaterals, if 3 be taken to be the correct value of <em>π</em>.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="48">
<li>In relation to a quadrilateral figure, each of whose sides is 15 (in measure), tell me the practically approximate value of the inscribed and the escribad circles.</li>

<p>Thus ends the calculation of practically approximatevalue in relation to areas.</p>
<p><strong>The Minutely Accurate Calculation of the<br>
Measure of Areas.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter in the calculation regarding the measurement of areas we shall expound the subject of treatment known as minutely accurate calculation. And that is as follows:-</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measure of the perpendicular (from the vertex to the base of a given triangle) and (also) of the segments into which the base is thereby divided) :-</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>The process of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> carried out between the base and the difference between the squares of the sides as divided by the base gives rise to the values of the two segments (of the base) of the triangle. Learned teachers say that the square root of the difference between the squares of (either of) these (segments) and of the(corresponding adjacent) side gives rise to the measure of the perpendicular.</li>

$c_{1}~ = ~\left( c~ + ~\frac{a^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{c} \right)~ \times ~\frac{1}{2}$; $c_{2}~ = ~\left( c~ - ~\frac{a^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{c} \right)~ \times ~\frac{1}{2}$; $p~ = ~\sqrt{a^{2}~ - ~{c_{1}}^{2}}~or~\sqrt{b^{2}~ - ~{c_{2}}^{2}}$.Here a, b, c, represent the measures of the sides of a triangle, c₁, c₂, the measures of the segments ofthe base whose total length is <em>c</em>; and <em>p</em>represents the length of the perpendicular.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate measurement of the area (of trilateral and quadrilateral figures) :-</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>Four quantities represented (respectively) by half the sum of the sides as diminished by (each of) the sides (taken in order) are multiplied together; and the square root (of the product so obtained) gives the minutely accurate measure (of the area of the figure). Or the measure of the areas may he arrived at by multiplying by the perpendicular (from the top to the base) half the sum of the top measure and the base measure. (The latter rule does) not (hold good) in the case of an inequi-lateral quadrilateral figure.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="51">
<li>
<p>In the case of an equilateral triangle, 8 <em>daṇḍas</em> give the measure of the base as also of each of the two sides. You, who know calculation, tell me the accurate value of the area(thereof) and also of the perpendicular (to the base) as well as of the segments (of the base caused thereby).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an isosceles triangle (each of the) two (equal) sides measures 13 <em>daṇḍas</em>, and the base measures 10. (What is) the accuratemeasure of the area thereof, and of the perpendicular (to the base) as also of the segments (of the basecaused thereby) ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Algebraically represented :-</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Areaof a trilateral figure $= ~\sqrt{s~(s~ - ~a)~(s~ - ~b)~(s~ - ~c)}$;where <em>s</em> is halfthe sum of the sides, a, b, c the respective measures of the sides of the trilateral figure; or $= ~\frac{c}{2}~ \times ~p$, where <em>p</em>is the perpendicular distance of the vertex from the base.</p>
<p>Area of a quadrilateral figure $= ~\sqrt{(s~ - ~a)~(s~ - ~b)~(s~ - ~c)~(s~ - ~d)}$where <em>s</em>is half the sum of the sides, and a, b, c, d the measures of the respective sides of the quadrilateral figure ;<br>
or = (b + d) / 2 x p(except in the case of an inequilateral quadrilateral) where<em>p</em> is the measure of either of the perpendiculars drawn to the base from the extremities of the top side.</p>
<p>The formulas here given for trilateral figures are correct; but thesegiven for quadrilatral figures hold good only in the case of cyclicquadrilaterales, as in these formulas sight is lost of the fact that for the same measure of the sidesthevalue of the area as well as of the perpendicular may vary.</p>
<ol start="53">
<li>In the case of a scalene triangle one of the sides is 13 (in measure), the opposite side is 15, and the base is 14. What indeed is the calculated measure (of the area of this figure), and what of the perpendicular (to the base) and of the basal segments ?</li>
</ol>
<p>Hereafter (we give) the rule for arriving at the value of the diagonal of the five varieties of quadrilateral figures.</p>
<ol start="54">
<li>The two quantities obtained by multiplying the basal side by the (larger and the smaller of the right and the left) sides are (respectively) combined with the two (other) quantities obtained by multiplying the top side by the (smaller and the larger of the right and the left) sides. The (resulting) two sumsconstitute the multiplier and the divisor as also the divisor and the multiplier in relation to the sum of the products of the opposite sides. The square roots (of the quantities so obtained) give the required measures of the diagonals.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="55">
<li>In the case of an equilateral quadrilateral which has all around a side measure of 5, tell me quickly, 0 friend who know the secret of calculation, the value of the diagonal and also the accurate value of the area.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>54</strong>. Algebraically represented the measure of the diagonal of a quadrilateral figure as given here is-<br>
$\sqrt{\frac{(ac~ + ~bd)~(ad~ + ~cd)}{ad~ + ~bc}}$ or$\sqrt{\frac{(ac~ + ~bd)~(ad~ + ~bc)}{ab~ + ~cd}}$.</p>
<p>These formulas also are correct only for cyclicquadrilaterals. Bhāskarācārya is aware of the futility of attempting to give the measure of the area of a qadrilateral without previously knowing the values of the perpendicular or of the diagonals. Vide the following stanza from his <em>Līlāvatī</em> :-</p>
<p>लम्बयोः कर्णयोर्वैकमनिर्दिश्यापरान् कथम् ।</p>
<p>पृच्छत्यनियतत्वेऽपि नियतं चापि तत्फलम् ॥</p>

<ol start="56">
<li>
<p>In the case of a longish quadrilateral, the (horizontal) sideis 12 in measure and the perpendicular side is 5in measure. Tell me quickly what the measure of the diagonal is and what the accurate measure of the area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basal side of an equi-bilateral quadrilateral is 36. One of the sides is 61 and the other also is the same. The top side is 14. What is the diagonal and what the accurate measure of the area ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an equi-trilateral quadrilateral, the square of 13 (gives the measure of an equal side); the base, however, is 407 in measure. What is the value of the diagonal, of the basal segments, of the perpendicular and of the area ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The (right and the left) sides of an inequilateral quadrilateral are 13 x 15 and 13 x 20 (respectively in measure); the top side is 5³, and the side below is 300. What are all the values here beginning with that of the diagonal ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hereafter (are given) the rules for arriving at the minutely accurate values relating to curvilinear figures. Among them the rule for arriving at the minutely accurate values relating to a circular figure is as follows:-</p>
<ol start="60">
<li>The diameter of the circular figure multiplied by the square rootof 10 becomes the circumference(in measure). The circumference multiplied by one-fourth of the diameter gives the area. In the case of a semicircle this happens to be half (of what it is in the case of the circle).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="61">
<li>In the case of one (circular) field the diameter of the circle is 18; in the case of another it is 60; in the case of yet another it is 22. What are the circumferences and the areas ?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>60</strong>. The value of <em>π</em> given in this stanza is $\sqrt{10}$, which is equal to 3:16&hellip;. Compare this with the more approximate value $\frac{62832}{20000}~\left( = ~3.1416 \right)$ given by Āryabhata. Bhāskarācārya also gives to it the same value, and represents it in reduced terms as $\frac{3927}{1250}$.</p>
<ol start="62">
<li>In the case of a semicircular field of a diameter measuring 12, and of (another) field having a diameter of 36 in measure what is the circumference and what the area ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate values relating to an elliptical figure :-</p>
<ol start="63">
<li>The square of the (shorter) diameter is multiplied by 6 and the square of twice the length (as measured by the longer diameter) is added to this. (The square root of this sum gives) the measure of the circumference. This measure of the circumference multiplied by one-fourth of the (shorter) diameter gives the minutely accurate measure of the area of an elliptical figure.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="64">
<li>In the case of an elliptical figure, the length (as measured by the longer diameter) is 36, and the breadth (as measured by the shorter diameter) is 12. Tell me, after calculation, what the measure of the circumference is, and what the minutely accuratemeasure of the area.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate values in relation to a conchiform figure :-</p>
<p>65$\frac{1}{2}$. The (maximum measure of the) breadth (of the figure), diminished by half (the measure of the breadth) of the mouth, and (then) multiplied by the square root of 10, gives rise to the measure of the perimeter. The square of half the(maximum)breadth (of the figure) as diminished by half the (breadth of the) mouth, and the square of one-fourth of the (breadth of the) mouth are added together; and the resulting sum is multiplied by the square root of 10. This gives rise to the minutely accurate measure of the area in the case of the conchiform figure.</p>
<p><strong>63</strong>. If <em>a</em> represents the measure of the longer diameter and <em>b</em> that of the shorter diameter of an ellipse, then, according to the rule given here, the circumference is $\sqrt{6b^{2}~ + ~4a^{2}}$, and the area is $\frac{1}{4}b~ \times ~\sqrt{6b^{2}~ + ~4a^{2}}$. It may be noted that this stanza, as found in the MSS., omitsto mention that the square root of the quantity is to be taken for arriving at the value of the circumference. The formula for the area given here is only an approximation, and seems to be based on the analogy of the area of a circle as represented by ${\pi d}~ \times ~\frac{d}{4}$, where <em>d</em>is the diameter and <em>π**d</em> is the circumference.</p>
<p><strong>65</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically, circumference $= ~\left( a~ - ~\frac{1}{2}m \right)~ \times ~\sqrt{10}$ ; area $= ~\left\lbrack \left\{ \left( a~ - ~\frac{1}{2}m \right)~ \times ~\frac{1}{2} \right\}^{2}~ \times ~\left( \frac{m}{4} \right)^{2} \right\rbrack~ \times ~\sqrt{10}$ ; where <em>a</em> is the measure of themaximum breadth, and <em>m</em> the measure of the mouth of a conchiform figure. As observed in the note relating to stanza 23 of this chapter, the figure intended is obviously made up of two unequal semicircles.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>66$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a conchiform curvilinear figure the(maximum breadth is 18 <em>daṇḍas</em>, and the breadth of the mouth is 4 (<em>daṇḍas</em>). What is the measure of the perimeter and what the minutely acourate measure of the area as calculated?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate measures in relation to outreaching and inlying annular figures:-</p>
<p>67$\frac{1}{2}$. The (inner) diameter, to which the breadth (of the annulus) is added, is multiplied by the square root of 10 and by the breadth (of the annulus). This gives rise to the value of the area of the out-ronching annulus, The (outer) diameter as diminished by the breadth (of the annulus) gives rise (on being treated in the same manner as above) to the value of the area of the inlying annular figure.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>68$\frac{1}{2}$. Eighteen <em>daṇḍas</em>measure the (inner or the outer) diameter of the annulus (as the case may be); the breadth of the annulus is, however, 3 (<em>daṇḍas</em>). You give out the minutely accurate value of the area of the outreaching as well as the inlying annular figure.</p>
<p>69$\frac{1}{2}$. The (outer) diameter is 18 <em>daṇḍas</em>, and the breadth of the inlying annulus is 4 <em>daṇḍas</em>. You give out the minutely accuratevalue of the area of the inlying annular figure.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate values relating to a figure resembling (the longitudinal section of) the <em>yava</em> grain, and also to a figure having the outline of a bow:-</p>
<p>70$\frac{1}{2}$. It should be known that the measure of the string (chord) multiplied by one-fourth of the measure of the arrow, and then multiplied by the square root of 10, gives rise to the (accurate) value of the area in the case of a figure having the outline of a bow as also in the case of a figure resembling the (longitudinal) section of a <em>yava</em> grain.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>71$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a figure resembling (the longitudinal) section of the <em>yava</em> grain, the (maximum) length is 12 <em>daṇḍas</em>; the two ends are needle points, and the breadth in the middle is 4 <em>daṇḍas</em>. What is the area ?</p>
<p>72$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a figure having the outline of a bow, the string is 24 in measure; and its arrow is taken to be 4 in measure. What may be the minutely accurate value of the area ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measure of the (bent) stick of the bow as well as of the arrow, in the case of a figure having the outline of a bow :-</p>
<p><strong>70$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>.The figure resembling a bow is obviously the segment of a circle. The area of the segment as given here $= ~c~ \times ~\frac{p}{4}~ \times ~\sqrt{10}$. This formula is not accurate. It seems to be based on the analogy of the rule for obtaining the area of a semi-circle, which area is evidently equal to the product of<em>π</em>,the diameter and one-fourth of the radius, i.e.,$\pi~ \times ~2r~ \times ~\frac{r}{4}$.<figure class="">

    </a>

    

</figure>
</p>
<p>The figure resembling the longitudinal section of a <em>yava</em> grain may be easily seen to be made up of two similar and equal segments of a circle applied to each other so as to have a common chord. It is evident that in this case the value of the arrow-line becomes doubled. Thus the same formula is made to hold good here also.</p>
<p>73$\frac{1}{2}$. The square of the arrow measure is multiplied by 6. To this is added the square of the string measure. The squareroot of that (which happens to be the resulting sum here) gives rise to the measure of the (bent) bow-stick. In the ease of finding out the measure of the string and the measure of the arrow, as course converse to this is adopted.</p>
<p>The rule relating to the process according to the converse (here mentioned) :-</p>
<p>74$\frac{1}{2}$. The measure of the arrow is taken to be the square root of one-sixth of the difference between the square of the string and the square of the (bent stick of the) bow. And the square root of the remainder, after subtracting six times the square of the arrow from the square of the (bent stick of the) bow, gives rise to the measure of the string.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>75$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a figure having the outline of a bow, the string-measure is 12, and the arrow-measureis 6. The measure of the bent stick is not known. You (find it out), o friend. (In the case of the same figure) what will be the string-measure (when the other quantities are known), and what its arrow-measure (when similarly the other requisite quantities are known)?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate result in relation to figures resembling a <em>Mṛdaṅga</em>, and having the outline of a <em>Paṇava</em>, and of a <em>Vajra -</em></p>
<p>73$\frac{1}{2}$ &amp; 74$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically,<br>
arc $= ~\sqrt{6p^{2}~ + ~c^{2}}$;</p>
<p>perpendicular $= ~\frac{a^{2}~ - ~c^{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$;</p>
<p>chord $\sqrt{a^{2}~ - ~6p^{2}}$.In giving the rule for the measure of the arcin terms of the chord and the largest perpendicular distance betweeen the arcand the chord, the arcforming a semicircle is taken as the basis, and the formula obtained for it is utilized for arriving at the value of the art of any segment. The semicircular arc $= ~r~ \times ~\sqrt{10}~ = ~\sqrt{10r^{2}}~ = ~\sqrt{6a^{2}~ + 4r^{2}}$:based on this is the formula for any arc;where p = the largest perpendicular distance between the arcand the chord, and c = the chord.</p>
<p>76$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:245"><a href="#fn:245" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">245</a></sup>. To the resulting area, obtained by multiplying the (maximum) length with (the measure of the breadth of) themouth, the value of the areas of its associated bow-shaped figures is added. The resulting sum gives the value of the area of a figure resembling (the longitudinal section of) a <em>Mṛdaṅga</em>. In the caseof those two (other) figures which resemble (the longitudinal section of) the <em>Paṇava</em>, and (of) the <em>Vajra</em>, that (same resulting Area, which is obtained by multiplying the maximum length with the measure of the breadth of the mouth), is diminished by the measure of the areas of the associated bow-shaped figures. (The remainder gives the requird measure of the area concerned.)</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>77$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a figure having the outline configuration of a <em>Mṛdaṅga</em>, the (maximum) length is 24; the breadth of (each of the two mouths is 8; and the (maximum) breadth in the middle is 16. What is the area ?</p>
<p>78$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a figure having the outline of a <em>Paṇava</em>, the (maximum) length is 24 ; similarly the measure (of the breadth of either) of the two mouths is 8; and the central breadth is 4. What is the area ?</p>
<p>79$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a figure having the outline of a <em>Vajra</em>, the (maximum) length is 24; the measure (of the breadth of either) of the two mouths is 8; and the centralis a point. Give out as before what the area is.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate value of the areas of figures resembling (the annulus making up) the rim of a wheel, (resembling) the crescent moon and the (longitudinal) section of the tusk of an elephant :-</p>
<p>80$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of (a circular annulus resembling) the rim of awheel, the sum of the measures of the inner and the outer curves is divided by 6, multiplied by the measure of the breadthof the annulus, and again multiplied by the square root of 10. (The result gives the value of the required area.) Halfof this is the (required) value of the area in the case of figures resembling the crescent moon or (the longitudinal section of) the tusk of an elephant.</p>
<p>80$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule here given for the area of an annulus, if expressed algebraically, comes to be $\frac{\left( a_{1}~ + ~a_{2} \right)}{6}~ \times ~p~ \times ~\sqrt{10}$, where <em>a₁</em>and <em>a₂</em>are the measures of the two circumferences, and <em>p</em> is the measure of the breadth of the annulus. On a comparison of this value of the area of the annulas with the approximate value of the same as given in stanza 7 above (vide note thereunder), it will be evident that the formula here does not give the accurate value, the value mentioned in the rule in stanza 7 being itself the accurate value. The mistake seems to have arisen from a wrong notion that in the determination of the value of this area,<em>π</em> is involved even otherwise than in the values of <em>a₁</em>and <em>a₂</em>.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>81$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a field resembling (the circular annulus forming) the rim of a wheel, the outer curve is 14 in measure and the inner 8; and the (breadth in the) middle is 4. (What is the area ?) What is it in the case of a figure resembling the crescent moon, and in the case of a figure resembling (the longitudinal section of) the tusk of an elephant (the measures requisite for calculation being the same as above) ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate value of the area of a figure forming the interspace included inside four (equal) circles (touching each other):-</p>
<p>82$\frac{1}{2}$. If the minutely accurate measure of the area of any one circle is subtracted from the quantity which forms the square of thediameter (of the circle), there results the value of the areaof the interspace included within four equal circles (touching each other).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>83$\frac{1}{2}$. What is the minutely accurate measure of the area of the interspace included within four mutually touching (equal) circles whose diameter is 4 (in value) ?</p>
<p>82$\frac{1}{2}$. The rationale of the rule will be clear from the figure below:-<figure class="">

</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate value of the figure formed in the interspace caused by three (equal) circular figures touching each other :-</p>
<p>84$\frac{1}{2}$. The minutely accurate measure of the area of an equilateral triangle, each side of which is equal in measure to the diameter (of the circles) is diminished by half the area of any of the (three equal) circles. The remainder happens to be the measure of the interspace area caused by three (mutually touching equal circles).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>85$\frac{1}{2}$. What is the minutely accurate calculated value of a figure forming the interspace enclosed by three mutually touching (equal) circles the diameter (of each) of which is 4 in measure ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the minutely accurate values of the diagonal, the perpendicular and the area in the case of a (regular) six-sided figure :-</p>
<p>86$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a (regular) six-sided figure, the measureof the side, the square of the side, the square of the square of the side multiplied respectively by 2, 3 and 3 give rise, in that sameorder, to the values of the diagonal, of the square of the perpendicular, and of the square of the measure of the area.</p>
<p><strong>84</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly the figure here elucidates at once the reason of the rule :-</p>

<p><strong>86</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule seems to contemplate a regular hexagon. The formula given for the value of the area of the hexagon is $\sqrt{3a^{4}}$, where <em>a</em> is the length of a side.The correct formula, however, is    $a^{2}~ \times ~\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$.</p>

<p>87$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a (regular) six-sided figure each sido is 2<em>daṇḍas</em>in measure.In relation to it, what are the squares of the measures of the diagonal, of the perpendicular and of the minutely accurate area of the figure ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical measure of the sum of a number of square root quantities as well as of the remainder left after subtracting a number of square root quantities one from another in the natural order :-</p>
<p>88$\frac{1}{2}$. (The square root quantities are all) divided by (such) a (common) factor (as will give rise to quotients which aresquare quantities). The square roots (of the square quantities so obtained) are added together, or they are subtracted (one from another in the natural order). The sumand remainder (so obtained) are (both) squared and (then) multiplied (separately) by the divisor factor (originally used). The square roots (of these resulting products) give rise to the sum and the (ultimate) difference of the quantities (given in the problem). Know this to be the process of calculation in regard to (all kinds of) square root quantities.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>89$\frac{1}{2}$. O my friend who know the result of calculations, tell me the sum of the square roots of the quantities consisting of 16, 36 and 100; and then (tell me) also the (ultimate) remainder in relation to the square roots (of the same quantities).</p>
<p>Thus ends the minutely accurate calculation (of the measure of areas).</p>
<p>88$\frac{1}{2}$. The word <em>karaṇi</em> occurring here denotes any quantity the square root of which is to be found out, the root itself being rational or irrational as the casemay be. The rule will be clear from the following working of the problem given in stanza 89$\frac{1}{2}$:</p>
<p>To find the value of$\sqrt{16}~ + ~\sqrt{36}~ + \sqrt{100}$and$\sqrt{100}~ - ~\left( \sqrt{36}~ - ~\sqrt{16} \right)$. These are to be represented as $\sqrt{4}\left( \sqrt{4}~ + ~\sqrt{9}~ + ~\sqrt{25} \right)~;~\sqrt{4}~\left\{ \sqrt{25}~ - ~\left( \sqrt{9}~ - ~\sqrt{4} \right)~ \right\}$.<br>
$= ~\sqrt{4}~(2~ + ~3~ + ~5)~;~~~ = ~\sqrt{4}~\left\{ 5~ - ~(3~ - ~2)~ \right\}. = ~\sqrt{4}~(10)~;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = ~\sqrt{4}~(4). = ~\sqrt{4}~ \times ~\sqrt{100}~;~~~~~~~~ = ~\sqrt{4}~ \times ~\sqrt{16}. = ~\sqrt{400}~;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = ~\sqrt{64}. = ~20~;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = ~8.$.</p>
<p><strong>Subject of treatment known as the Janya operation.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall give out the <em>janya</em> operation in calculations relating to measurement of areas. The rule for arriving at a longish quadrilateral figure with optionally chosen numbers as <em>bījas</em>: -</p>
<p>90$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of the optionally derived longish quadrilateral figure the difference between the squares (of the <em>bīja</em> numbers) constitutes the measure of the perpendicular-side, the product (of the <em>bīja</em>numbers) multiplied by two becomes the (other) side, and the sum of the squares (of the <em>bīja</em>numbers) becomes the hypotenuse.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>91$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to the geometrical figure to be derived optionally, 1 and 2 are the <em>bījas</em>to be noted down. Tell (me) quickly after calculation the measurements of the perpendicular-side, theother side and the hypotenuse.</p>
<p>92$\frac{1}{2}$. Having noted down, O friend, 2 and 3 as the <em>bījas</em>in relation to a figure to be optionally derived, give out quickly, after calculating, the measurements of the perpendicular-side, the other side and the hypotenuse.</p>
<p>Again another rule for constructing a longish quadrilateral figure with the aid of numbers denoted by the name of <em>bījas</em> :-</p>
<p><strong>90</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. <em>Janya</em> literally means &ldquo;arising from &quot; or &ldquo;apt to be derived&rdquo;, hence it refershere to trilateral and quadrilateral figures that may be derived out of certain given data. The operation known as <em>janya</em> relates to the finding out of the length of the sides of trilateral and quadrilateral figures to be so derived.</p>
<p>*Bīja,*as given here, generally happens to be a positive integer. Two such are invariably given for the derivation of trilateral and quadrilateral figures dependent on them.</p>
<p>The rationale of the rule will be clear from the following algebraicalrepresentation :-</p>
<p>If <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>are the <em>bīja</em> numbers, then <em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>² is the measure of the perpendicular, 2 <em>ab</em> that of the other side, and <em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>² that of the hypotenuse, of an oblong. From this it is evident that the <em>bījas</em> are numbers with the aid of the product and the squares whereof, as forming the measures of the sides, a right-angled triangle may be constructed.</p>
<p>93$\frac{1}{2}$. The product of the sum and the difference of the <em>bījas</em>forms the measure of the perpendicular-side. The <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> ofthe squares of that (sum and the difference of the <em>bījas</em>) gives rise (respectively) to the measures of the (other) side and of the hypotenuse. This also is a process in the operation of (constructing a geometrical) figure to be derived (from given <em>bījas</em>).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>94$\frac{1}{2}$. O friend, who know the secret of calculation, constructa derived figare with the aid of 3 and 5 as <em>bījas</em>, and then think out and mention quickly the numbers measuring the perpendicular-side, the other side and the hypotenuse (thereof).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the <em>bīja</em> numbers relating to a given figure capable of being derived (from <em>bījas</em>).</p>
<p>95$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:246"><a href="#fn:246" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">246</a></sup>. The operation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> between (an optionally chosen exact) divisor of the measure of the perpendicular-side and the resulting quotient gives rise to the (required) <em>bījas</em>. (An optionally chosen exact) divisor of half the measure of the (other) side and the resulting quotient (also) form the <em>bījas</em>(required). Those (<em>bījas</em>)**are, (respectively), the square roots of half the sum and of half the difference of the measure of the hypotenuse and the square of a (suitably) chosen optional number.</p>
<p>An example in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>96$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to a certain geometrical figure, the perpendicular is 16 : what are the <em>bījas</em>? Or the other side is 30 : what are the <em>bījas</em>? The hypotenuse is 34: what are they (the <em>bījas</em>) ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical measures of the other side and of the hypotenuse, when the numerical measure of the perpendicular-side is known; for arriving at the numerical measures of the perpendicular-side and of the hypotonuse, when the numerical measure of the other side is known;and for arrivingat the numerical measure of the perpendicular-side and of the other side, when the numerical measure of the hypotenuse is known :-</p>
<p><strong>93$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>. In the rule given here, <em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²,2<em>a**b</em>,and <em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>² are represented as $(a~ + ~b)~(a~ - ~b),~\frac{(a~ + ~b)^{2}~ - ~(a~ - ~b)^{2}}{2}$ and $\frac{(a~ + ~b)^{2}~ + ~(a~ - ~b)^{2}}{2}$.</p>
<p>97$\frac{1}{2}$. The operation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>, conducted between (an optionally chosen exact) divisor of the square of the measure of the perpendicular-side and the resulting quotient, gives rise to the measures of the hypotenuse and of the other side (respectively). Similarly (the same operation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>) in relation to the square of the measure of the other side (gives rise to the measures of the perpendicular-side and of the hypotenuse). Or, the square root of the difference between the squares of the hypotenuse and of a (suitably chosen) optional number forms, along with that chosen number, the perpendicular-side and the other siderespectively.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>98$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a certain (geometrical) figure, the perpendicular-side is 11 in measure ; in the case of another figure, the (other) side is 60; and in the case of (still) another figure the hypotenuse is 61. Tell me in these cases the measures of the unmentioned elements.</p>
<p>The rule regarding the manner of arriving at a quadrilateral figure having two equal sides (with the aid of the given <em>bījas</em>) -</p>
<p><strong>97</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. This rule depends on the following identities:-<br>
I.$\left\{ ~\frac{\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)^{2}}{(a~ - ~b)^{2}}~ \pm (a~ - ~b)^{2}~ \right\}~ \div ~2~ = ~a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}~or~~2ab$as the case may be</p>
<p>I. $\left\{ ~\frac{(2ab)^{2}}{2b^{2}}~ \pm ~2b^{2}~ \right\}~ \div ~2~ = ~a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}~or~~a^{2}~ - ~b^{2}$.</p>
<p>III. $\sqrt{\left( a^{2}~ + ~b^{2} \right)^{2}~ - ~(2~ab)^{2}}~ = ~a^{2}~ - ~b^{2}$.</p>
<p>99$\frac{1}{2}$. The perpendicular-side of the primary figure derived (with the aid of the given <em>bījas</em>), on being added to the perpendicular-side (in another figure) derived with the aid of the (two optionally chosen) factors of half the base of (this original) derivedfigure (taken as the <em>bījas</em>), gives rise to the measure of the base of the (required) quadrilateral with two equal sides. The difference (between the measures of these two perpendiculars) gives the top-measure (of the quadrilateral). The smaller of the diagonals (relating to the two derived figures already mentioned) gives the measure of (either of the two equal) sides. The smallerof the (two) perpendicular-sides (in relation to the two derived figures under reference) gives the measure of the (smaller) segment (of the base formed by the perpendicular dropped thereunto from either of the end-points of the top-side). The larger of the (two) diagonals (in relation to the two derived figures of reference) gives the measure of the (required) diagonal. The area of the larger (of two derived figures of reference) is the area of the (required)figure; and the measure of the base (of either of the derived figures of reference) happens to be the measure of the perpendicular (dropped to the base from either of the end-points of the topsidein the required figure).</p>
<p><strong>99</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The problem solved in the rule stated in this stanza is to construct with the aid of two given <em>bījas</em>a quadrilateral having two equal sides. The length of the sides of the diagonals, of the perpendicular from the end-points of the top-side to the base, and of the segments thereof caused by the perpendicular are all derived from two rectangles constructed with the aid of the given <em>bījas</em>. The first of these rectangles is formed according to the rule given in stanza 90$\frac{1}{2}$ above. The second rectangle is formed according to the same rule from two optionally chosen factors of half the length of the base of the first rectangle, taken as <em>bījas</em>. Hence the first rectangle is called the primary figure in the translation to distinguish it from the second rectangle.<br>
The rationale of the rule will be clear from the following diagrams illustrating the problem given for solution in stanza 100$\frac{1}{2}$. Here 5 and 6 are the <em>bījas</em>given; and the first rectangle or the primary figure derived from the <em>bījas</em>is ABCD :-</p>

    </a>

    

</figure>
<p>Half the length of the base in this figureis 30; and two factors of this, namely, 3 and 10 may be chosen. The rectangleconstructed with the aid of these numbers as <em>bījas</em>is EFGH:</p>

<p>To construct the required quadrilateral with two equal sides, one of the two triangles into which the first rectangle is divided by its diagonal is applied to thesecond rectangle on one side, and a portion equal to the same triangle is removed from the same second rectangle on the other side, as shown in the figure HA&rsquo;FC&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The process will be clear from a comparison of the diagrams:</p>

<p>Area of the required quadrilateral, HA&rsquo;FC&rsquo;= area of the second rectangle, EFGH.<br>
Base A&rsquo;F= perpendicular-side of the first rectangle plus perpendicular-side of the second rectangle, i.e., AB + EF.</p>

<p>Diagonal HF = diagonal of the second rectangle.</p>
<p>Smaller segment of the base, i.e., A&rsquo;E = perpendicular-side of the first rectangle, i.e., AB.</p>

<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>100$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to a quadrilateral with two equal sides constructed with the aid of 5 and 6 as <em>bījas</em>give out the measures of the top side, of the base, of (either of the two equal) sides, of the perpendicular (from the top to the base), of the diagonal), of the (lesser) segment (of the base), and of the area.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measures of the top-side, of the base, of (any one of) the (equal) sides, of the perpendicular (from the top to the base), of the diagonal, of the (lesser) segment (of the base) and of the area, in relation to a quadrilateral having three equal sides (with the aid of given <em>bījas</em>) :-</p>
<p>101$\frac{1}{2}$. The difference between the (given) <em>bījas</em>is multiplied by the square root of the base (of the quadrilateral immediately derived with the aid of those <em>bījas</em>). The area of (this immediately) derived (primary) quadrilateral is divided (by the product so obtained). Then, with the aid of the resulting quotient and the divisor (in the operation utilized as <em>bījas</em>, a second derived quadrilateral of referenceis constructed. A third quadrilateral ofreference is further constructed) with the aid of the measurements of the base and the perpendicular-side (of the immediately derived quadrilateral, above referred to used as <em>bījas</em>. Then, with the aid of these two last derived secondary quadrilaterals, all the required) quantities appertaining to the quadrilateral with three equal sides are (to be obtained) as in the case of the quadrilateral with two equal sides.</p>
<p><strong>101</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$.If <em>a</em> and<em>b</em>represent the given <em>bījas</em>, the measures of the sides of the immediately derived quadrilateral are:-</p>
<p>Perpendicular-side =<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²</p>
<p>Base =2<em>a**b</em></p>
<p>Diagonal =<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²</p>
<p>Area =2<em>a**b</em>×(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)</p>
<p>As in the case of the construction of the quadrilateral with two equal sides (vide stanza 99$\frac{1}{2}$ ante), this rule proceeds to construct the required quadrilateral with three equal sides with the aid of two derived rectangles. The <em>bījas</em>in relation to the first of these rectangles are:-<br>
$\frac{2ab~ \times ~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)}{\sqrt{2ab}~ \times ~(a~ - ~b)}~i.e.,~\sqrt{2ab}~ \times ~(a~ + ~b),~and~\sqrt{2ab}~ \times ~(a~ - ~b)$.</p>
<p>Applying the rule given in stanza 90$\frac{1}{2}$ above, we have for the first rectangle :</p>
<p>Perpendicular-side =(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)²×2<em>a**b</em>−(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)²×2<em>a<strong>b</strong>o**r</em>8<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²</p>
<p>Base $= ~2~ \times ~\sqrt{2ab}~ \times ~(a~ + ~b)~ \times ~\sqrt{2ab}~ \times ~(a~ - ~b)~or~4ab~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)$.</p>
<p>Diagonal =(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)²×2<em>a**b</em>+(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>)²×2<em>a<strong>b</strong>o**r</em>4<em>a**b</em>(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²⁾.</p>
<p>The <em>bījas</em>in the case of the second rectangle are: <em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²<em>a<strong>n</strong>d</em>2<em>a**b</em>.</p>
<p>The various elements of this rectangle are:</p>
<p>Perpendicular-side =4<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²−(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)²;</p>
<p>Base =4<em>a**b</em>(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²);</p>
<p>Diagonal =4<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²+(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)²<em>o**r</em>(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²)².</p>
<p>With the help of these two rectangles, the measures of the sides, diagonals, etc, of the required quadrilateral are ascertained as in the rule given in stanza 99$\frac{1}{2}$ above. They are :</p>
<p>Base = sum of the perpendicular sides =8<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²−{4<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²−(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)²}=(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²)².</p>
<p>Top-side =greater perpendicular-side<em>minus</em>smaller perpendicular-side<br>
= 80a²b² - {4a²b²-(a²-b²)²} = (a²+ b²)².</p>
<p>Either of the lateral sides = smaller diagonal =(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²)².</p>
<p>Lesser segment of the base = smaller perpendicular-side =4<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²−(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)².</p>
<p>Perpendicular = base of either rectangle =4<em>a**b</em>(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>Diagonal = the greater of the two diagonals =4<em>a**b</em>(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>Area = area of the larger rectangle =8<em>a</em>²<em>b</em>²×4<em>a**b</em>(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>It may be noted here that the measure of either ofthe two lateral sides is equal to the measure of the top-side. Thus is obtained the required quadrilateral with three equal sides.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>102$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to a quadrilateral with three equal sides and having 2 and 3 as its <em>bījas</em>, give out the measures of the top-side, of the base of (any one of) the (equal) sides, of the perpendicular (from the top to the base), of the diagonal, of the (lesser) segment (of the base) and of the area.</p>
<p>The rulefor arriving at the measures of the top-side of the base, of the (Iateral) sides, of the perpendiculars (from the ends of the top-side to the base), of the diagonals, of the segments (of the base) and of the area, in relation to a quadrilateral the sides of which are (all) unequal :-</p>
<p>103$\frac{1}{2}$. With the longer and the shorter diagonals (of the two derived rectangular quadrilateral figures related to the two setsof given <em>bījas</em>), the base and the perpendicular-side (of the smaller and the larger derived figures of reference) are respectively multiplied. The products (so obtained) are (separately) multiplied (again) by the shorter diagonal. The resulting products give the measures of the two (unequal) sides, of the base and of the top-side (in relation to the required quadrilateral). The perpendicular-sides (of the derived figures of reference) are multiplied by each other&rsquo;s bases; and the two products (so obtained) are added together. Then to the product of the (two) perpendicular-sides (relating to the two figures of reference), the product of the bases (of those same figures of reference) is added. The (two) sums (so obtained), when multiplied by the shorter of the (two) diagonals (of the two figures of reference), give rise to the measures of the (required) diagonals. (Those same) sums, when multiplied by the base and the perpendicular-side (respectively) of the smaller figure (of reference), give rise to the measures of the perpendiculars (dropped from the ends of the diagonals); and when multiplied (respectively) by the perpendicular-side and the base (of the same figure of reference), give rise to the measures of the segments of the base (caused by the perpendiculars). The measures of these segments, when subtracted from the measure of the base, give the values of the (other) segments (thereof). Hall of the product of the diagonals (of the required figurearrived at as above) gives the measure of the area (of the required figure).</p>
<p>103$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will be clear from the following algebraical representation.<br>
Let a, b, and c, d, be two sets of given <em>bījas</em>. Then the various required elements are as follow:-</p>
<p>Lateral sides =2<em>a**b</em>(<em>c</em>²+<em>d</em>²)(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²) and (<em>a</em>²+−<em>b</em>²)(<em>c</em>²+<em>d</em>²)(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>Base =2<em>c**d</em>(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²)(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>Top-side =(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²)(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>Diagonals {(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)×2<em>c**d</em>+(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)2<em>a**b</em>}×(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²);and<br>
{(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)+4<em>a<strong>b</strong>c**d</em>}×(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²)</p>
<p>Perpendiculars {(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)×2<em>c**d</em>+(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)2<em>a**b</em>; and<br>
{(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>)(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)+4<em>a<strong>b</strong>c**d</em>}×(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)</p>
<p>Segments ={(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)×2<em>c**d</em>+(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)×2<em>a**b</em>}(<em>a</em>−<em>b</em>²); and {(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)(<em>c</em>²−<em>a</em>²)+4<em>a<strong>b</strong>c**d</em>}×2<em>a**b</em>.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>104$\frac{1}{2}$. After forming two derived figures (of reference) with 1 and 2, and 2 and 3 as the requisite <em>bījas</em>give out, in relation to a quadrilateral figure the sides whereof are all unequal,the values of the top-side, of the base of the (Iateral) sides, of the perpendiculars, of the diagonals, of the segments (of the base), and of the area.</p>
<p>Again another rulefor arriving at (the measures of the sides, etc., in relation to) a quadrilateral, the sides of which are all unequal :-</p>
<p>105$\frac{1}{2}$-107$\frac{1}{2}$. The square of the diagonal of the smaller (of the two derived oblongs of reference), as multiplied (separately) by the base and also by the perpendicular-side of the larger (oblong of reference), gives rise to the measures (respectively) of the base and of the top-side (of the required quadrilateral having unequal sides). The base and the perpendicular-side of the smaller (oblong of reference, each) multiplied successively by the two diagonals(one of each of the oblongs of reference), give rise to the measures (respectively) of the two (lateral) sides (of the required quadrilateral). The difference between the base and the perpendicular-side of the larger (oblong of reference) is in two positions (separately) multiplied by the base and by the perpendicular-sideof the smaller (oblong of reference). The two (resulting) products (of this operation) are added (separately) to the product obtained by multiplying the sum of the base and the perpendicular-side of the smaller (oblong of reference) with the perpendicular-side of the larger (oblong of reference). The two sums (so obtained), when multiplied by the diagonal of the smaller (oblong of reference), give rise to the values of the two diagonals (of the required quadrilateral). The diagonals (of the required quadrilateral) are (separately) divided by the diagonal of the smaller (oblong ofreference). The quotients (so obtained) are multiplied respectively by the perpendicular-side and the base of the smaller (oblong of reference). The (resulting) products give rise to the measures of the perpendiculars (in relation to the required quadrilateral). To these (two perpendiculars), the above values of the two sides (other than the base and the top-side) are (separately) added, (the larger side being added to the larger perpendicular and the smaller side to the smaller perpendicular). The differences between these perpendiculars and sides are also obtained (in the same order). The sums (above noted) are multiplied (respectively) by (these) differences. The square roots (of the products so obtained) give rise to the values of the segments (of the base in relation to the required quadrilateral). Half of the product of the diagonals (of the required quadrilateral) gives the value of (its) area.</p>
<p><strong>105$\frac{1}{2}$-107</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The same values as are mentioned in the footnote to stanza 103 1/2 above are given here for the measures of the sides, etc., only they are stated in a slightly different way. Adopting the same symbols as in the note to stanza 103 1/2, we have:<br>
Diagonals =[{2<em>c**d</em>−(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)}2<em>a**b</em>+{2<em>a**b</em>+(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)}(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)]×(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²); and [{2<em>c**d</em>−(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)}(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)+{2<em>a**b</em>+(<em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²)}(<em>c</em>²−<em>d</em>²)]×(<em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>²).</p>
<p>Perpendiculars $\frac{\left\lbrack ~\left\{ ~2cd~ - ~\left( {c^{2}}_{1}~ - ~d^{2} \right)~ \right\}~ \times ~2ab~ + ~\left\{ ~2ab~ + ~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)~ \right\}~\left( c^{2}~ - ~d^{2} \right)~ \right\rbrack~\left( a^{2}~ + ~b^{2} \right)}{\left( a^{2}~ + ~b^{2} \right)}~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)$and$\frac{\left\lbrack ~\left\{ ~2cd~ - ~\left( c^{2}~ - ~d^{2} \right)~ \right\}~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2}~ + ~ \right)~\left\{ ~2ab~ + ~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)~ \right\}~\left( c^{2}~ - ~d^{2} \right)~ \right\rbrack~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)}{\left( a^{2}~ + ~b^{2} \right)}~ \times ~2ab$</p>
<p>The above four expressions can be reduced to the form in which the measures of the diagonals and the perpendiculars are given in stanza No. 103$\frac{1}{2}$. The measures of the segments of the base are here derived by extracting the square root of the difference between the squares of the side and of the perpendicular corresponding to the segment.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at an isosceles triangle with the aid of a single derived oblong (of reference).</p>
<p>108$\frac{1}{2}$. The two diagonals (of the oblong of referenceconstructed with the aid of the given <em>bījas</em>) become the two (equal) sides of the (required) isosceles triangle. The base (of the oblong of reference), multiplied by <em>two</em>, becomes the base (of the required triangle). The perpendicular-side (of the oblong of reference) is the perpendicular (of the required triangle from the apex to the base thereof). The area (of the required triangle) is the area(of the oblong of reference).</p>
<p>108$\frac{1}{2}$. The rationale of the rulemay be made out thus :- Let ABCD be an oblong and let AD be produced to E so that AD = DE. Join EC. It will be seen that ACE is an isosceles triangle whose equal sides are equal to the diagonals of the oblong and whose area is equal to that of the oblong.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>

<p>The rule regarding the manner of constructing a trilateral figure of unequal sides :-</p>
<p>110$\frac{1}{2}$. Half of the base of the (oblong of reference) derived (with the aid of the given <em>bījas</em>) is divided by an optionally chosen facter. With the aid of the divisor and the quotient (in this operation as <em>bījas</em>), another (oblong of reference) is derived. The sum of the perpendicular-sides belonging to these two (oblongs of reference) gives the measure of the base of the (required) trilateral figure having unequal sides. The two diagonals (related to the two oblongs of reference)givethe two sides (of the required triangle). The base (of either of the two oblongs of reference) gives the measure of the perpendicular (in the case of the required triangle).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>111$\frac{1}{2}$. After constructing a second (derived oblong of reference) with the aid of half the base of the (original) figure (i.e. oblong of reference) derived with the aid of 2 and 3 as <em>bījas</em>, you tell (me) by means of this (operation) the values of the sides, of the base and of the perpendicular in a trilateral figure of unequal sides.</p>
<p>Thus ends the subject of treatment known as the <em>Janya</em> operation.</p>
<p>110$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will be clear from the following construction :-Let ABCD and EFGH bethe two<br>
derived oblongs, such that the base AD = the base EH. Produce BA to K so that AK = EF. It can be easily shown that DK = EG and that the triangle BDK has its base BK = BA+ EF, called the perpendiculars of the oblongs, and has its sides equal to the diagonals of the same oblongs.</p>
<p><strong>Subject of treatment known as Paiśācika or<br>
devilishly difficult problems.</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter we shall expound the subject of treatment known as <em>Paiśācika</em>.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving, in relation to the equilateral quadrilateral or longish quadrilateral figures, at the numerical measure of the base and the perpendienlar-side, when, out of the perpendicular side, the base, the diagonal, the area and the perimeter, any two are optionally taken to be equal, or when the area of the figure happens to be the product obtained by multiplying respectively by optionally chosen multipliers any two desired quantities (out of the elements mentioned above): that is - (the rule for arriving at the numerical values of the base and the perpendicular-side in relation to an equilateral quadrilateral or a longish quadrilateral figure,) when the area of the figure is (numerically) equal to the measure of the perimeter (thereof); or, when the area of the figure is numerically equal to the measure of the base (thereof); or, when the area of the figure is numerically equal to the measure of the diagonal (thereof); or, when the area of the figure is numerically equal to half the measure of the perimeter; or, when the area of the figure is numerically equal to one-third of the base; or, when the area of the figure is numerically equal to one-fourth of the measure of the diagonal; or, when the area of the figure is numerically equal to that doubled quantity which is obtained by doubling the quantity which is the result of adding together twice the diagonal, three times the base, four times the perpendicular-side and the perimeter and so on :-</p>
<p>112$\frac{1}{2}$. The measure of the base (of an optionally chosen figure of the required type), on being divided by the (resulting) optional factor in relation thereto, (by multiplying with which the area of the said optionally chosen figure happens to be arrived at); or the base of such an optionally chosen figure of the requisitetype), on being multiplied by the factor with which the area (of the said figure) has to be multiplied (to give the required kind of result); gives rise to the measures of the bases of the (required) equilateral quadrilateral and other kinds of derived figures.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>113$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of an equilateral quadrilateral figure, the (numerical measure of the) perimeter is equal to (that of) the area. What then is the numerical measure of (its) base? In the case of another similar figure), the numerical measure of the) area is equal to (that of) the base. Tell me in relation to that (figure) also (the numerical measure of the base).</p>
<p>114$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of an equilateral quadrilateral figure, the (numerical) measure of the diagonal is equal to that of the area. What may be the measure of (its) base ? And in the case of another (similar) figure, the (numerical) measure of the perimeter is twice that of the area. Tell me (what may be the measure of its base).</p>
<p>115$\frac{1}{2}$. Here in the case of a longish quadrilateral figure, the (numerical) measure of the area is equal to that of the perimeter; and in the case of another (similar) figure, the (numerical) measure of the area is equal to that of the dingonal. What is the measure of the base (in each of these cases) ?</p>
<p>116$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a certain equilateral quadrilateral figure, the (numerical) measure of the base is three times that of the area. (In the case of) another equilateral quadrilateral figure, the (numerical) measure of the diagonal is four times that of the area. What is the measure of the base (in each of these cases) ?</p>
<p>112$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule will be clear from the following working of the first example given in stanza 113$\frac{1}{2}$- Here theproblem is to find out the measure of the side of an equilateral quadrilateral, the numerical value of the area whereof is equal to the numerical value of the perimeter. Taking an equilateral quadrilateral of any dimension, say, with 5 as the measure of its side, we have the perimeter equal to 20, and the area equal to 25. The factor with whichthe measure of the perimeter, viz. 20, has to be multiplied in order to make it equal to the measure of the area, viz., 25, is $\frac{5}{4}$. If 5, the measure of a side of the optionally chosen quadrilateral is divided by this factor $\frac{5}{4}$, the measure of the side of the required quadrilateral is arrived at.</p>
<p>The rule gives also in another manner what is practically the same process thus: The factor with which the measure of the area, viz. 25 has to be multiplied in order to make it equal to the measure of the perimeter, viz. 20, is $\frac{4}{5}$. If 5, the measure of a side of the optionally chosen figure is multiplied by this factor $\frac{4}{5}$, the measure of the side of the required figure is arrived at.</p>
<p>117$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a longish quadrilateral figure, (the numerical measures of) twice the diagonal, three times the base and four times the perpendicular-side being taken, the measure of the perimeter is added to them. Twice (this sum) is the (numerical) measure of the area. (Find out the measure of the base.)</p>
<p>118$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a longish quadrilateral figure, the(numerical) measure of the perimeter is 1. Tell me quickly, after calculating, what the measure of its perpendicular side is, and what that of the base.</p>
<p>119$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a longish quadrilateral figure, the (numerical measures of twice the diagonal, three times the base, and four times the perpendicular, on being added to the (numerical) measure of the perimeter, become equal to 1. (Find out the measure of the base.)</p>
<p>Another rule regarding the process of arriving at the number representing the <em>bījas</em>in relation to the derived longish quadrilateral figure :-</p>
<p>120$\frac{1}{2}$. The operation to arrive at the generating (<em>bījas</em>) in relation to a longish quadrilateral figure consists in getting at the square roots of the two quantities represented by (1) half of the diagonal as diminished by the perpendicular-side and (2) thedifference between this quantity and the diagonal.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>121$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a longish quadrilateral figure, the perpendicular-side is 55, the base is 48, and then the diagonal is 73. What are the <em>bījas</em>here ?</p>
<p>120$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule in stanza 95$\frac{1}{2}$of this chapter relates to the method of arriving at the <em>bījas</em>from the base or the perpendicular or the diagonal of a longish quadrilateral. But the rule in this stanza gives a method for finding out the <em>bījas</em>from the perpendicular and the diagonal of a longish quadrilateral. The process described is based on the following identities:-<br>
$\sqrt{\frac{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}~ - ~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)}{2}}~ = ~b$; and $\sqrt{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}~ - ~\frac{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}~ - ~\left( a^{2}~ - ~b^{2} \right)}{2}}~ = ~a$where <em>a</em>²+<em>b</em>² is the measure of the diagonal, and <em>a</em>²−<em>b</em>²is the measure of the perpendicular-side of a longish quadrilateral, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> being the required <em>bījas</em>.</p>
<p>The rulefor arriving at the (longish quadrilateral) figureassociated with a diagonal having a numerical value optionally determined :-</p>
<p>122$\frac{1}{2}$. Each of the various figures that are derived with the aid of the given (<em>bījas</em>) is written down; and by means (of the measure) of its diagonal the (measure of the) given diagonal is divided. The perpendicular-side, the base, and the diagonal (of this figure) as multiplied by the quotient (here) obtained, give rise to the perpendicular-side, the base and the diagonal (of the required figure).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>123$\frac{1}{2}$-124$\frac{1}{2}$. Omathematician, quickly bring out with the aid of the given (<em>bījas</em>) the (value of the) perpendicular-sides and the bases of the four longish quadrilateral figures that have respectively 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 4 and 7, and 1 and 8, for their <em>bījas</em>, and are also characterised by different bases. And, (in the problem) here, the diagonal is (in value) 65. Give out (the measures of) what may bethe (required) geometrical figures (in that case).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical values of the base and the perpendicular side of that derived longish quadrilateral figure, the numerical measures of the perimeter as also of the diagonal whereof are known :-</p>
<p>125$\frac{1}{2}$. Multiply the square of the diagonal by two; (from the resulting product), subtract the square of half the perimeter; (then) get at the square root (of the resulting difference). If (this square root be thereafter) utilized in the performance of theoporation of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> along with half the perimeter, the (required) base and also the perpendicular-side are arrived at.</p>
<p><strong>122</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule is based on the principle that the sides of a right angled trianglevary as the hypotenuse, although for the same measure of the hypotenuse there may be different sets of values for the sides.</p>
<p><strong>125</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. If<em>a</em>and <em>b</em> represent the sides of a rectangle, then $\sqrt{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}}$ is the measure of the diagonal, and 2<em>a</em>+2<em>b</em> is the measure of the perimeter. It can be seen easily that$\left\{ \frac{2a~ + ~2b}{2}~ + ~\sqrt{2\left( \sqrt{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}} \right)^{2}~ - ~\left( \frac{2a~ + ~2b}{2} \right)^{2}}~ \div ~2~ = ~a~;~and\left\{ \frac{2a~ + ~2b}{2}~ - ~\sqrt{2\left( \sqrt{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}} \right)^{2}~ - ~\left( \frac{2a~ + ~2b}{2} \right)^{2}}~ \div ~2~ = ~b \right. \right.$.<br>
These two formulas represent algebraically the method described in the rule here.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>126$\frac{1}{2}$. The perimeter in this case is 34; and the diagonal is seen to be 13. Give out, after calculating, the measures of the perpendicular-side and the base in relation to this derived figure.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical values of the base and the perpendicular-side when the area of the figure and the value of the diagonal are known :-</p>
<p>127$\frac{1}{2}$. Twice the measure of the area is subtracted from the square of the diagonal. It is also added to the square of the diagonal. The square roots (of the difference and of the sum so obtained) give rise to the measures of the (required) perpendicular-side and the base, if the larger (of the square roots) is made to undergo the process of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> in relation to the smaller (square root).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>128$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a longish quadrilateral figure, the measure of the area is 60, and the measure of its diagonal is 13. I wish to hear (from you) the measures of the perpendicular-side and the base.</p>
<p>The rulefor arriving at the numerical values of the base and the perpendicular-sidein relation to a longish quadrilateral figure, when the numerical value of the area of the figure and the numerical value of the perimeter (thereof) are known :-</p>
<p>129$\frac{1}{2}$. From the quantity representing the square of half the perimeter, the measure of the area as multiplied by <em>four</em> is to besubtracted. Then, on carrying out the process of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em> with the square root (of this resulting difference) in relation to half the measure of the perimeter, the values of the (required) base and the perpendicular-side are indeed obtained.</p>
<p><strong>127</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Adopting the same symbols as in the note to stanza 125$\frac{1}{2}$, we have the following formula to represent the rule here given :-<br>
$\left\{ \sqrt{\left( \sqrt{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}} \right)^{2}~ + ~2ab}~ \pm ~\sqrt{\left( \sqrt{a~ + ~b^{2}} \right)^{2}~ - ~2ab}~ \right\}~ \div ~2~ = ~a~or~b$<br>
as the case may be.</p>
<p><strong>129$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>. Here we have$\left\{ ~\frac{2a~ + ~2b}{2}~ \pm ~\sqrt{\left( \frac{2a~ + ~2b}{2} \right)^{2}~ - ~4ab}~ \right\}~ \div ~2~ = ~a~or~b$, as the casemay be.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>130$\frac{1}{2}$. In a derived longish quadrilateral figure, the measure of the perimeter is 170; the measure of the given area is 1,500. Tell me the values of the perpendicular-side and the base (thereof).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the respective pairs of (required) longish quadrilateral figures, (1) when the numerical measures of the perimeter are equal, and the area of the first figure is double that of the second ; or, (2) when the areas of both the figures are equal, and the numerical measure of the perimeter of the second figure is twice the numerical measure of that of the first figure: or, (3) (again) when, in relation to the two required figures, the numerical measure of the perimeter of the second figure is twice the numerical measure of the perimeter of the first figure, and the area of the first figure is twice the area of the second figure :-</p>
<p>131$\frac{1}{2}$-133. (The larger numbers in the given ratios of) the perimeters as also (of) the areas (relating to the two required longish quadrilateral figures,) are divided by the smaller (numbers) corresponding to them. (The resulting quotients) are multiplied (between themselves) and (then) squared. (This same quantity.)on being multiplied by the given optional multiplier, gives rise to the value of the perpendicular-side. And in the case in which the areas (of the two required figures) are (held to be) equal; (this measure of) the perpendicular-side as diminished by <em>one</em> becomes the measure of the base. But, inthe other case (wherein the areas of the required figures are not held to be equal), the larger (ratio number) relating to the areas is multiplied by the given optional multiplier, and (the resulting product is) diminished by <em>one</em>. The measure of the perpendicular-side (arrived at as above) is diminished by the quantity (thus resulting) and is (then) multiplied by <em>three</em>: thus the measure of the base (is arrived at), Then, in respect of arriving at the other (of the two required quadrilateral figures), its base and perpendicular are to be brought out with the aid of the (now knowable) measure of its area and perimeter in accordance with the rule already given (in stanza 129$\frac{1}{2}$).</p>
<p><strong>131</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$ <strong>to 133</strong>. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> represent the two adjacent sides of the first rectangle, and <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> the two adjacent sides of the second rectangle, the conditions mentioned in the three kinds of problems proposed to be solved by this rule may be represented thus:-</p>
<p>(1)<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>=<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>:<br>
<em>x**y</em>=2<em>a**b</em>.</p>
<p>(2) 2(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>)=<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>:<br>
<em>x**y</em>=<em>a**b</em>.</p>
<p>(3) 2(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>)=<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>:<br>
<em>x**y</em>=2<em>a**b</em>.</p>
<p>The solution given in the rule seems to be correct only for the particular cases given in the problems in stanzas 134 to 136.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>

<p>The rule for arriving at a pair of isosceles triangles, so that the two isosceles triangles are characterised either by the values of their perimeters and of their areas being equal to each other, or by the value of their perimeters and of their areas forming multiples of each other :-</p>
<ol start="137">
<li>The squares (of the ratio-values) of the perimeters (of the required isosceles triangles) are multiplied by (the ratio-values of) the areas (of those triangles) in alternation. (Of the two products so obtained), (the larger one is) divided by the smaller ; and (the resulting quotient) is multiplied by six and (is also separately multiplied) by <em>two</em>. The smaller (of the two products so obtained) is diminished by <em>one</em>. The larger product and the diminished smaller product constitute the two <em>bījas</em> (in relation to the longish quardrilateral figure) from which one (of the required triangles) is to be obtained. The difference between these (two <em>bījas</em>, above, noted) and twice the smaller one (of those <em>bījas</em>) constitute the <em>bījas</em>(in relation to the longish quadrilateral figure) from which the other (required triangle) is to be obtained. (From the two longish quadrilateral figures formed with the aid of their respective <em>bījas</em>), the sides and the other things (relating to the required triangles) are to be arrived at as (explained) before.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>137</strong>. When <em>a</em>:<em>b</em>isthe ratio of the perimeters of the two isosceles triangles, and <em>c</em>:<em>d</em>the ratio of their areas, then, according to the rule,$\frac{6b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}$and$\frac{2b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~1$and$\frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ + ~1$and$\frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~2$ are the two sets of <em>bījas</em>, with the help of which the values of the various required elements of the two isoscelestriangles may be arrived at. The measures of the sides and the altitudes, calculated from these <em>bījas</em>according to stanza 108$\frac{1}{2}$in this chapter, when multiplied respectively by <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, (the quantities occurring in the ratio of the perimeters), give the required measures of the sides and the altitudes of the two isosceles triangles. They are as follow:-<br>
I. Equal side$= ~a~ \times ~\left\{ ~\left( \frac{6b^{2}c}{a^{2}d} \right)^{2}~ + ~\left( \frac{2b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~1 \right)^{2} \right\}$</p>
<p>Base$\left. = ~a~ \times ~2~ \times ~2~ \times ~\frac{6b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ \times ~\left( \frac{2b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~1 \right)^{2} \right\}$</p>
<p>Altitude$= ~a~ \times ~\left\{ ~\left( \frac{6b^{2}c}{a^{2}d} \right)^{2}~ + ~\left( \frac{2b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~1 \right)~ \right\}$</p>
<p>II. Equal side $= ~b~ \times ~\left\{ ~\left( \frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ + ~1 \right)^{2}~ - ~\left( \frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~2 \right)^{2} \right\}$<br>
Base $b~ \times ~2~ \times ~2~ \times ~\left( \frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ + ~1 \right)~ \times ~\left( \frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~2 \right)$</p>
<p>altitude $= ~b~ \times ~\left\{ ~\left( \frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ + ~1 \right)^{2}~ - ~\left( \frac{4b^{2}c}{a^{2}d}~ - ~2 \right)^{2}~ \right\}$<br>
Now it may be easily proved from these values that the ratio of the perimetersis <em>a</em>:<em>b</em>, and that of the areas is <em>c</em>:<em>d</em>, as taken for granted at the beginning.</p>

<p>The rule for arriving at an equilateral quadrilateral figure, or for arriving at a regular circular figure, or for arriving at an equilateral triangular figure, or for arriving at a longish quadrilateral figure, with the aid of the numerical value of the proportionatepart of a given suitable thing (from among these), when any optionally chosen number from among the (natural) numbers, starting with <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>, &amp;e., and going beyond calculation, is made to give the numerical measure of that proportionate part of that given suitable thing :-</p>
<ol start="142">
<li>The (given measure of the) area (of the proportionate part) is divided by the (appropriately) similarised measure of the part held (in the hand). The quotient (so obtained), if multiplied by <em>four</em>, gives rise to the measure of the breadth of the circle and(also) of the square. (That same) quotient, if multiplied by <em>six</em>, gives rise to the required measure of the base of the (equilateral) triangle as also of the longish quadrilateral figure. Half (of this) is the measure of the perpendicular-side (in the case of the longish quadrilateral figure).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>142</strong>. In problems of the kind given under this rule, a circle, or a square, Oran equilateral triangle, or an oblong is divided into a desired number of equal parts, each part being bounded on one side by aportion of the perimeter and bearing the same proportion to the total areaof the figure as the portion of the perimeter bears to the perimeter as a whole. It will be seen that in the case of a circle each part is a sector, in the case of a square and an oblong it is a rectangle, and in the case of an equilateral triangle it is a triangle. The area of each part and the length of the original perimeter contained in each part are both of givenmagnitude. The stanza states a rule for finding out the measure of the diameter of the circle, or of the sides of the square, or the equilateral triangle or the oblong. If <em>m</em> represents the area of each part and <em>n</em>the length of a part of the total perimeter, the formulas given in the rule are-<br>
$\frac{m}{n}~ \times ~4~ =$diameter of the circle, or side of the square;<br>
and $\frac{m}{n}~ \times ~6~ =$ side of the eqnilateral triangle or of the oblong;<br>
and half of $\frac{m}{n}~ \times ~6~ =$ the length of the perpendicular-side in the case of the oblong.</p>
<p>The rationale will be clear from the following equations, where <em>x</em>represents the number of parts into which each figure is divided, <em>a</em> is the length of the radius in the case of the circle, or the length of a side in the case of the other figures;and <em>b</em> is the vertical side of the oblong:-<br>
In the case of the Circle $\frac{x~ \times ~m}{x~ \times ~n}~ = ~\frac{{\pi a}^{2}}{2{\pi a}}$;</p>
<p>In the case of the Square$\frac{x~ \times ~m}{x~ \times ~n}~ = ~\frac{a^{2}}{4a}$;</p>
<p>In the case of the Equilateral Triangle$\frac{x~ \times ~m}{x~ \times ~n}~ = ~\frac{\frac{a^{2}}{2}}{3a}$;</p>
<p>In the case of the Oblong $\frac{x~ \times ~m}{x~ \times ~n}~ = ~\frac{a~ \times ~b}{2~(a~ + ~b)}$; here<em>b</em> is taken to be equal to half of <em>a</em>. It has to be noted that only the approximate value of the area of the equilateral triangle, as given in stanza 7 of this chapter, is adopted here. Otherwise the formulagiven in the rule will not hold good.</p>

<p>The problem here is to construct quadrilateral figure of given area and with two equal sides. For this purpose an optionally chosen number and a set of two <em>bījas</em>are given. The process described in the rule will become clear by applying it to the problem given in the next stanza. The bījas mentioned therein are 2 and 3 ; and the given area is 7, the given optional number being 3.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing we have to do is to construct a rectangle with the aid of the given <em>bījas</em>in accordance with the rule laid down in stanza 90$\frac{1}{2}$in this chapter. That rectangle comes to have 5 for the measure of its smaller side, 12 for the measure of its larger side, and 13 for the measure of its diagonal; and its area is 60 in value. Now the area given in the problem is to be multiplied by the square of the given optional number in the problem, so that we obtain 7 × 3²=63.</p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>From this 63, we have to subtract 60, which is the measure of the area of the rectangle constructed on the basis of the given <em>bījas</em>: and this gives 3 as the remainder. Then the thing to be done is to construct a rectangle, the area whereof is equal to this 3, and one of the sides is equal to the longer side of the rectangle derived from the same <em>bījas</em>.</p>
<p>Since this longer side is equal to 12 in value, the smaller side of the required rectangle has to be 1/4 in value as shown in the figure here. Then the two triangles, into which the rectangle derived from the <em>bījas</em>may be split up by its diagonal are added one on each side to this last rectangle, so that the sides measuring 12 in the case of these triangles coincide with the sides of the rectangle having 12 as their meusure. The figure here exhibits the operation.</p>

<p>Thus in the end we get the quadrilateral figure having two equal sides, each of which measures 13, the value of the other two sides being $\frac{1}{4}$ and 10$\frac{1}{4}$ respectively. From this the values of the sides of the quadrilateral required in the problem may be obtained by dividing by the given optional number namely 3, the values of its sides represented by 13, $\frac{1}{4}$,13 and 10$\frac{1}{4}$.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="149">
<li>The accurate value of the (given) area is 7; the optional given multiplier is 3; and the <em>bījas</em>aresoon to be 2 and 3. Give out the values of the two sides of a quadrilateral figure with two equal sides and of its top-side, base, and perpendicular.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at a quadrilateral figure with three equal sides, having an accurately measured given area, (with the aid of a given multiplier):-</p>
<ol start="150">
<li>
<p>The square of the value of the (given) area is divided by the cube of the given (multiplier). (Then) the given (multiplier) is added (to the resulting quotient). Half (of the sum so obtained) gives the measure (of one) of the (equal) sides.

</li>
<li>
<p>It is stated in the rule here that the given areas when divided by the given optional number gives rise to the value of the perpendicular in relation to the required figure. As the areais equal to the product of the perpendicular and half the sum of the base and the top-side, the given optional number represents the measure of half the sum of the base and the top side. If ABCD be a quadrilateralwith three equal sides, and CE the perpendicular from C on AD, then AE is half the sum of AD and BC, and is equal to the given optional number. It can be easily shown that 2<em>A**D</em>.<em>A**E</em>=<em>C**E</em>²<em>A**E</em>².</p>

$\therefore~AD~ = ~\frac{CE^{2}~ + ~AE^{2}}{2AE}~ = ~\frac{CE^{2}}{2~AE}~ + ~\frac{AE}{2}~ = ~\frac{\frac{CE^{2}~ \times ~AE^{2}}{AE^{3}}~ + ~AE}{2}~ = ~\frac{\frac{(CE~ \times ~AE)^{2}}{AE^{3}}~ + ~AE}{2}$ Here<em>C**E</em>×<em>A**E</em>=thegiven area of the qundrilateral.

<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="151">
<li>In the case of a certain quadrilateral figure with three equal sides, the accurate value of the area is 96. The given multiplier is 8. Give out the values of the base, of the sides, of the top-side and of the perpendicular.</li>

<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical measures of the topside, of the base, and of the (other) sides in relation to a quadrilateral figure having unequal sides, with the aid of 4 given divisors, when the accurate value of the area(of the required quadrilateral figure) is known :-</p>
<ol start="152">
<li>
<p>The square of the given area is divided (separately) by the four given divisors; (and the four resulting quotients are separately noted down). Half of the sum of (these) quotients is (noted down) in four positions, and is (in order) diminished (respectively) by those (quotients noted down above). The remainders(so obtained) give rise to the numerical values of the sides of a quadrilateral figure (having unequal sides and consequently) named &rsquo; unequal.&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The area of quadrilateral with unequal sides has already been mentioned to be
$\sqrt{s~(s~ - ~a)~(s~ - ~b)~(s~ - ~c)~(s~ - ~d)}$, where s = half the perimeter, and a, b, c, and d are the measures of the sides (vide note to stanza 50 in this chapter). The rule here given requires that the numerical value of the area should be squared and then divided separately by the four optionally chosen divisors. If (<em>s</em>−<em>a</em>)(<em>s</em>−<em>b</em>)(<em>s</em>−<em>c</em>)(<em>s</em>−<em>d</em>) is divided by four suitably chosen divisors so asto give as quotients <em>s</em>−<em>a</em>,<em>s</em>−<em>b</em>,<em>s</em>−<em>c</em>, and <em>s</em>−<em>d</em>, then on adding these quotients and halving their sum, the result is seen to be <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em>is diminished in order by <em>s</em>−<em>a</em>,<em>s</em>−<em>b</em>,<em>s</em>−<em>c</em>, and <em>s</em>−<em>d</em>, the remainders represent respectively the values of the sides of the quadrilateral with unequal sides.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>153-153$\frac{1}{2}$. In the the case of a quadrilateral figure with unequalsides, the (given) accurate measure of the area is 90. And the product of 5 multiplied by 9, as multiplied by 10, 18, 20 and 36 respectively, gives rise to the (four given) divisors. Tell me quickly, after calculating, the numerical values of the top-side, the base and (other) sides.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical value of the sides of an equilateral triangular figure possessing a given accurately measured area, when the value of (that) accurately measured area is known :-</p>
<p>154$\frac{1}{2}$. Four times the (given) area is squared. (The resulting quantity) is divided by 3. The quotient (so) obtained happens to be the square of the square of the value of the side of an equilateral triangular figure.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>155$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a certain equilateral triangular figure, the given area is only 3. Calculate and tell me the value of (its) side.</p>
<p>After knowing the exact numerical measure of a (given) area, the rule for arriving at the numerical values of the sides, the base and the perpendicular of an isosceles triangular figure having that same accurately measured aroa (as its own) :-</p>
<p>156$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of the isosceles triangle (to be so) constructed, the square root of the sum of the squares of the quotient obtained by dividing the (given) area by an optionally chosen quantity, as also of (that) optionally chosen quantity, gives rise to the value of the side : twice the optionally chosen quantity gives the measure of the base; and the area divided bythe optionally chosen quantity gives rise to the measure of the perpendicular.</p>
<p><strong>154</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule here given may be seen to be derived from the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, viz., area $= ~a^{2}~ \times ~\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}$ where <em>a</em> is the measure of a side.</p>
<p><strong>156</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. In problems of the kind contemplated in this rule, the measure of the area of an isosceles triangle is given, and the value of half the base chosen at option is also given. The measures of the perpendicular and the side are then easily derived from these known quantities.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>157$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of an isosceles triangular figure, the accurate measurement of the area is 12. The optionally chosen quantity is 3, Giveout quickly, O friend, the values of (its) sides, base, and perpendicular.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving, after knowing the exact numerical measure of a (given) area, at a triangular figure with unequal sides, having that same accurately measured area (as its own) :-</p>
<p>158$\frac{1}{2}$. The given area is multiplied by <em>eight</em>, and to the resulting product the square of the optionally chosen quantity is added. Then the square root (of the sum so resulting is obtained).</p>
<p>The cube (of this square root) is (thereafter) divided by the optionally chosen number and (also) by the square root (obtained as above).Half of the optionally chosen number gives the measure of the base (of the required triangle). The quotient (obtained in the previous operation) is lessened (in value) by the (measure of this) base. (The resulting quantity) is to be used in carrying out the <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>process in relation to the square of the optionally chosen quantity as divided by <em>two</em> as well as the square root (mentioned above). (Thus) the values of the sides are arrived at.</p>
<p>158$\frac{1}{2}$. If<em>A</em> represents the area of a triangle, and <em>d</em> is the optionally chosen number, then according to the rule the required values are obtained thus :<br>
$\frac{d}{2}~ =$base;<br>
$\frac{\frac{\left( \sqrt{8A~ + ~d^{2}} \right)^{3}}{d~\sqrt{8A~ + ~d^{2}}}~ - \frac{d}{2}~ \pm ~\frac{d^{2}}{2~\sqrt{8A~ + ~d^{2}}}}{2}~ =$sides.</p>
<p>When the area and the base of a triangle are given, the locus of the vertex is a line parallel to the base, and the sides can have any set of values. In order to arrive at a specificset of values for the sides, it is evidently assumed here that the sum of the two sides is equal to the sum of the base and twice the altitude, i.e., equal to$\frac{d}{2}~ + ~2\frac{A}{d~ \div ~4}$. With this assumption, the formula above given for the measure of the sides can be derived from the general formula for the area of the triangle, $\sqrt{s(s~ - ~a)~(s~ - ~b)~(s~ - ~c)}$ given in stanza 50 of this chapter.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>159$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a certain triangular figure with unequalsides, it has been pointed out that 2 constitutes the accurate measure of its area and 3 is the optionally chosen quantity. What is the value of the base as well as of the sides (of that triangle) ?</p>
<p>Again, another rule for arriving, after knowing the exact numerical measure of a (given) area, at a triangular figure with unequal sides having that same (accurately measured) area (as its own) :-</p>
<p>160$\frac{1}{2}$-161$\frac{1}{2}$. The square root of the measure of the given area as multiplied by <em>eight</em> and as increased by the square of an optionally chosen number is obtained. This and the optionally chosen number are divided by each other. The larger (of these quotients) is diminished by half of the smaller (quotient). The remainder (thus obtained) and (this) half of the smaller (quotient) are respectively multiplied by the above-noted square root and the optionally chosen number. Oncarrying out, in relation to the products (thus obtained), the process of <em>saṅkramaṇa</em>, the values of the base and of one of the sides are arrived at. Half of the optionally chosen number happens to be the measure of the other side in a triangular figure with unequal sides.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>162$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a triangle with unequal sides, the accuratemeasure of the area is 2, and the optionally chosen quantity is 3. O friend who know the secret of calculation, give out the measure of the base as well as of the sides.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving, after knowing the accurate measure of a(given) area, at a regularly circular figure having that accurately measured area (as its own) :-</p>
<p>163$\frac{1}{2}$. The accurate measure of the area is multiplied by <em>four</em> And is divided by the square root of <em>ten</em>. On getting at the squareroot (of the quotient resulting thus), the value of the diameter happens to result. In relation to a regular circular figure, the measure of the area and the circumference are to be made out as explained before.</p>
<p><strong>163</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The rule in this stanza is derived from the formula, area$= ~\frac{d^{2}}{4}~ \times ~\sqrt{10}$, where <em>d</em> is the diameter of the circle.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>164$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a regular circular figure, the accurate measure of the area has been pointed out to be 5. Calculate quickly and tell me what the diameter of this (circle) may be.</p>
<p>On knowing the approximate measure as well as the accuratemeasure of an area, the rule for arriving at a quadrilateral figure with two equal sides as well as at a quadrilateral figure with three equal sides, having those same approximate and accurate measures (as such measures of their areas):-</p>
<p>165$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of (the quadrilateral with) two equal sides, the square root of the difference between the squares of the (approximate and accurate) measures of the areais to be obtained. On adding (this square root) to the optionally chosen quantity and on subtracting (the same square root from the same optionally chosen quantity), the base and the top-side are so obtained as to have to be divided by the square root of the optional quantity. The approximate measure of the area gives rise to the value of the sides so as to have to be divided by the square root of the optional quantity.</p>
<p><strong>165</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. If R represents the approximate area of a quadrilateral with two equal sides, and <em>r</em> the accurate value thereof, and <em>p</em> is the optionally chosen number, then base $\frac{\sqrt{R^{2}~ - ~r^{2}}~ + ~p}{\sqrt{p}}$; top side $\frac{p~ - ~\sqrt{R^{2}~ - ~r^{2}}}{\sqrt{p}}$and each of the equal sides $\frac{R}{\sqrt{p}}$.</p>

</figure>
<p>If a, b, c and d be the measures of the sides of the quadrilateral with two equal sides, then it may be seen that$R~ = ~\frac{a~(b~ + ~d)}{2};~p~ = ~\left( \frac{b~ + ~d}{2} \right)^{2};~and~r~ = ~\frac{b~ + ~d}{2}~ \times ~\sqrt{a^{2}~ - ~\frac{(b~ - ~d)^{2}}{4}}$.<br>
The formulas given above for the base and the top side can be easily verified by substituting these values of R, <em>r</em>and<em>p</em> therein. Similarly the rule may be seen to hold good in the case also of a quadrilateral figure with three equal sides.</p>
<p>In the case of (the quadrilateral figure with) three equal sides, the square root (of the difference between the two area-squares above noted) is added to the approximate measure of the area. (On treating the resulting sum as the optional quantity and) on adding and subtracting (the said square root as before), the base and the top-sideare obtained so as to have to be divided by the square root of (such) optional quantity. (Here also), the approximate measureof the area, on being divided by the square root of (this) optional quantity, gives rise to the measure of the other sides.</p>
<p>*An example in illustration thereof. *</p>
<p>166$\frac{1}{2}$. The accurate measure of the area is 5; the approximate measure of the area is 13; and the optionally chosen quantity is 16. What are the values of the base, the top-side, and the (other) side in the case of a quadrilateral figure with two equal sides ?</p>
<p><em>An example relating to a quadrilateral figure with three<br>
equal sides.</em></p>
<p>167$\frac{1}{2}$. The accurate measure of the areais 5; and the approximate measure of the area is 13. Think out and tell me, O friend, the values of the sides of the quadrilateral figure with three equal sides.</p>
<p>Therule for arriving, when the approximate and the accurate measures of an area are known, at the equilateral triangle and also at the diameter of the circle, having those sameapproximate and accurate measures (for their area) :-</p>
<p>168 1/2<sup id="fnref:248"><a href="#fn:248" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">248</a></sup>. That which happens to be the square root of the square root of the difference between the squares of the (approximate measure and of the accurate measure of the given) area is to bemultiplied by <em>two</em>. The result is the measure of the side in the (required) equilateral triangle. It is also the measure of the diameter of the (required) regular circle.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>169$\frac{1}{2}$. The approximate area is 18. The accurate area is the squareroot of 3³as multiplied by 9. Tell me, O friend, after calculating, the measurement of the (required) equilateral triangle.</p>
<p>170$\frac{1}{2}$. The accurate measure (of the area) is the square root of 6,250. The approximate measure (of the area) is 75. What is the measure of the diameter of the circle (having such areas) ?</p>
<p>When the practically approximate and the accurately calculated measures of an area are known, the rule for arriving at the numerical values of the base and the side of an isosceles trianglehaving the same approximate and securate measures for its area :-</p>
<p>171$\frac{1}{2}$. Twice the square root of the difference between the squares of the (approximate and the accurate) measures of the area is to be taken as the base of.a (certain isosceles) triangle; and the given approximate measure (of the area) is to be taken as the value of one of the equal sides. And on dividing (these values of the base and the side) by the square root of half (the above derived value) of the base, (the required measures of the base and the side of the required isosceles triangle are obtained). This is the rule in relation to the isosceles triangle.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>172$\frac{1}{2}$. It is pointed out that here, in this case, the accurate measure of the area is 60, and the approximate measure is 65. Tell me, O friend, after calculation, the numerical measure of the sides of the (required) isosceles triangle.</p>
<p>An optional number and a quadrilateral figure with two equal sides being given, the rule for arriving at the numerical values of the base, and the top-side, and the (other) sides of another quadrilateral figure (with two equal sides) which has an acurate measure of area equal to the accurate measure of the area of the given quadrilateral figure with two equal sides :-</p>
<p>173$\frac{1}{2}$. If the square of the value of the perpendicular (in thegiven quadrilateral figure with two equal sides) is used along with the given optional number in carrying out the procoss of <em>viṣama-saṅkramaṇa</em>, then the larger (of the two results obtained) becomes the measure of either of the equal sides (in the required quadrilateral figure with two equal sides). Half of the sum of the values of the top-side and the base (in the given quadrilateral figure with two equal sides), on being respectively increased and decreased by the smaller (of the two results in the <em>viṣama-saṅkramaṇa</em> process above-mentioned), gives rise to the values of the base and the top-side in the (required) quadrilateral figure with two equal sides.</p>
<p><strong>173</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The problem contemplated in this rule is to construct a quadrilateral with two equal sides that shall be equal in area to a given quadrilateral with two equal sides and shall also have the same perpendicular distance from the top-side to the base. Let <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>be the equal sides of the given quadrilateral, and<em>b</em> and <em>d</em>be the top side and the base thereof respectively; and let the value of the perpendicular distance be <em>p</em>. If <em>a₁, b₁, c₁, d₁</em>be taken to be the corresponding sides of the required quadrilateral, then, since the area and the perpendicular are the same in the case of both the quadrilaterals, we have,<br>
<em>d</em>₁+<em>b</em>₁=<em>d</em>+<em>b</em>(<em>I</em>):<br>
and $a^{2}~ - ~\left( \frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)^{2}~ = ~p^{2}~(II)$:</p>
<p>that is:$\left( a_{1}~ + ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)~\left( a_{1}~ - ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)~ = ~p^{2}$<br>
Let $a_{1}~ - ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2}~ = ~N$; then $a_{1}~ + ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2}~ = ~\frac{p^{2}}{N}$</p>
<p>$\left( a_{1}~ + ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)~ + ~\left( a_{1}~ - ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)~ = ~\frac{p^{2}}{N}~ + ~N$</p>
<p>$\therefore~\frac{\frac{p^{2}}{N}~ + ~N}{2}~ = ~a_{1}~(III);$and</p>
<p>$\frac{d~ + ~b}{2}~ \pm ~\frac{\frac{p^{2}}{N}~ + ~N}{2}~ = ~\frac{d_{1}~ + ~b_{1}}{2}~ \pm ~\left\{ ~\frac{\left( a_{1}~ + ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)~ - ~\left( a_{1}~ - ~\frac{d_{1}~ - ~b_{1}}{2} \right)}{2}~ = ~d_{1}~or~b_{1};~(IV) \right.$</p>
<p>Here<em>N</em> is what is called इष्ट or the optionally given number in the rule; sad formulas III and IV are those that are given in the rule for the solution of the problem.</p>
<p>An example in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>174$\frac{1}{2}$. The base (of the given quadrilateral figure) is 14 ; each of the (two equal) sides is 13; the top-side is 4; the perpendicular is 12; and the optionally given number is 10. What is that other quadrilateral figure with two equal sides, the accurate measure (of the area) of which is the same as (the accurate measure of) the area of (this given quadrilateral) ?</p>
<p>When an area with a given practically approximate measure is divided into any required number of parts, the rule for arriving at the numerical measure of the bases of those various parts of the quadrilateral figure with two equal sides, as also at the numerical measure of the sides as measured from the various division-points thereof, the numerical measure of the practically approximate value of the area of the quadrilateral figure with two equal sides being given :-</p>
<p>175$\frac{1}{2}$. The difference between the squares of the (numerical) values of the base and the top-side (of the given quadrilateral figure with two equal sides) is divided by the total value of the (required) proportionate parts. By the quotient (so obtained),the ratio values of the (various) parts are (respectively) multiplied. To each of the products (so obtained), the square of the measureof the top-side (of the given figure) is added. The square root (of the sum so obtained) gives rise to the value of the base (of each of the parts). The area (of each part divided by half the sum of the values of the base and the top-side(thereof) gives in (the requisite) order the value of the perpendicular (which for purposes of approximate measurement is treated as the side).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>176$\frac{1}{2}$. The measure of the top-side is given to be 7; that of the base below is 23, and that of each of the (remaining) sides is 30. The area (included within such a figure) is divided between two so that each obtains one (share). What is the value of the base (to be found out here) ?</p>
<p>177$\frac{1}{2}$-178$\frac{1}{2}$. The measure of the base (of a quadrilateral with two equal sides) is 162, and that of the top-side (thereof) is seen to be 18. The value of each of the (two equal) sides is 400. Theareaof this (figure so enclosed) is divided among 4 men. The parts obtained by the men are (in the proportion of) 1, 2, 3, and 4 rospectively. Give out, in accordance with this proportionate distribution, the values of the area, of the base, and (of either) of the (two equal) sides (in each case).</p>
<p><strong>175</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. If <em>ABCD</em> be a quadrilateral with two equal sides, and if <em>EF, GH</em> and <em>KL</em> divide the quadrilateral so that the divided portions are in the proportion of <em>m, n, p</em> and <em>q</em>in respect of area, then according to the rule,</p>
<p>EF$= ~\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}~ \times ~m~ + ~b^{2}}~;$</p>
<p>GH $= ~\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}~ \times ~(m~ + ~n)~ + ~b^{2}}~;$</p>
<p>KL $= ~\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + q}~ \times ~(m~ + ~n~ + ~p)~ + ~b^{2}}~;$</p>
<p>and so on.</p>

<br>
Similarly AE $= ~\frac{\left( a~ \times ~\frac{d~ + ~b}{2} \right)~ \times ~\frac{m}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}}{\frac{EF~ + ~AD}{2}}~;$EG$= ~\frac{\left( a~ \times ~\frac{d~ + ~b}{2} \right)~ \times ~\frac{n}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}}{\frac{GH~ + ~EF}{2}}~;$<br>

<p>$\therefore~EF^{2}~ = ~\frac{m~\left( BC^{2}~ - ~AD^{2} \right)}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + q}~ + ~AD^{2}~ = ~\frac{d^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}~ \times ~m~ + ~b^{2}~;$and</p>
<p>$EF~ = ~\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}~ \times ~m~ + ~b^{2}}~$.</p>
<p>Similarly the other formulas may also be verified.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> Although the text simply states that the quotient has to be multiplied by the value of the parts, what is intended is that the quotient has to be multiplied by the number representing the value of the parts up to the top-side in each case.That is, in the figure on the previous page, to arrive at GH,for instance,$\frac{d^{2}~ - ~b^{2}}{m~ + ~n~ + ~p~ + ~q}$has to be multiplied by <em><em>m</em>+<em>n</em></em> and not by<em>n</em> merely.</p>
<p>179$\frac{1}{2}$. The measure of the base (of the given quadrilateral figure) is 80, that of the top-side is 40; the measure (of either) of the (two equal) sides is 4×60. The share parts are (in the proportion of) 3, 8, and 5. (Find out the values of the areas, the bases, and the sides of the required parts).</p>
<p>In the case of two pillars of known height, two strings are tied, one to the top of each. Each of these two strings is stretched in the form of a hypotenuse so as to touch the foot of the other pillar, or so as to go beyond the other pillar and touch (the ground). From the point where the two hypotenuse strings meet, another string is suspended (perpendicularly ) till (it touches) the ground. The measure of this (last) string goes by the name <em>antarāvalambaka</em> or the inner perpendicular. The line starting on either side from the point where (this) perpendicular string touches (the ground) and going to the points where the (above-mentioned) hypotenuse strings touch the ground has the name of <em>ābādhā</em>, or the segment of the base. The rule for arriving at the values of such inner perpendicular and (such) segments of the base :-</p>
<p>180$\frac{1}{2}$. The measurement of each of the pillars is divided by the measurement of the base covering the length between the (foot of the pillar) and the (point of contact of the hypotenuse) string (with the ground). Each of the quotients (so obtained) is(then) divided by their sum. The (resulting) quotients, on being multiplied by the measure of the base (as a whole) give rise to the (respective basal) segments. These (measures of the segments respectively) multiplied in the inverse order by the quotients (obtained in the first instance as above), give rise (in each case) to the value of the inner perpendicular.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>181$\frac{1}{2}$. (The given) pillars are 16 <em>hastas</em> in height. The base (covering the length between the points where the strings touch the ground) is pointed out to be 16 <em>hastas</em>. Give out, in this case, the numerical value of the segments of the base and also of the inner perpendicular.</p>
<p>182$\frac{1}{2}$. The height of one pillar is 36 <em>hastas</em>; that of the second is 20 <em>hastas</em>. The length of the base-line is 12 <em>hastas</em>. What is the measure of the (basal) segments and what of the (inner) perpendicular ?</p>
<p>183$\frac{1}{2}$-184$\frac{1}{2}$. (The two pillars are) 12 and 15 <em>hastas</em> (respectively); the measure of the interval between the two pillars is 4 <em>hastas</em>. From the top of the pillar of 12 <em>hastas</em> a string is stretched so as to cover 4 <em>hastas</em> (along the basal line) beyond the foot of the other pillar. From the top of (this) other pillar (which is 15 <em>hastas</em> in height) a string is (similarly) stretched so as to cover 1 <em>hasta</em> (along the basal line) beyond the foot (of the pillar of 12<em>hastas</em> in height). What is the measure of the (basal) segments here, and what of the inner perpendicular ?</p>
<p>180$\frac{1}{2}$. If<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> represent the height of the pillars in the diagram, <em>c</em> the distance between the two pillars, and<em>m</em> and<em>n</em> the respective distances of the pillars from the point where the string stretched from the top of the other pillar meets the earth, then, according to the rule,<br>
$c_{1}~ = ~\left\{ ~\frac{a}{c~ + ~n}~ \div ~\frac{a~(c~ + ~m)~~ + ~b~(c~ + ~n)}{(c~ + ~m)~(c~ + ~n)}~ \right\}~ \times ~(c~ + ~m~ + ~n)~; c_{2}~ = ~\left\{ ~\frac{b}{c~ + ~m}~ \div ~\frac{a~(c~ + ~m)~ + ~b~(c~ + ~n)}{(c~ + ~m)~(c~ + ~n)}~ \right\}~ \times ~(c~ + ~m~ + ~n)~;$ where<em>c₁</em> and<em>c₂</em> are segments of the baseas a whole</p>
<p>; and $p~ = ~c_{1}~ \times ~\frac{b}{c~ + ~m}~,~or~c_{2}~ \times ~\frac{a}{c~ + ~n}$, where<em>p</em> is the measure of the inner perpendicular. From a consideration of the similar triangles in the diagram it may be seen that $\frac{c_{2}}{p}~ = ~\frac{c~ + ~n}{a}$and$\frac{c_{1}}{p}~ = ~\frac{c~ + ~m}{b}$.</p>
<p>From these ratio we get$\frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}}~ = ~\frac{a(c~ + ~m)}{b~(c~ + ~n)}~;$</p>
<p>$\therefore~\frac{c_{1}}{c_{1}~ + ~c_{2}}~ = ~\frac{a~(c~ + ~m)}{a~(c~ + ~m)~ + ~b~(c~ + ~n)}~;~\therefore~c_{1}~ = ~\frac{a~(c~ + ~m)~(c~ + ~m~ + ~n)}{a~(c~ + ~m)~ + ~b~(c~ + ~n)};$<br>
Similarly,
$c_{2}~ = ~\frac{b~(c~ + ~n)~(c~ + ~m~ + ~n)}{a~(c~ + ~m)~ + ~b~(c~ + ~n)}~;~and~p~ = ~c_{2}~ \times ~\frac{a}{c~ + ~n},~or~c_{1}~ \times ~\frac{b}{c~ + ~m}.$</p>
<p>185$\frac{1}{2}$. (In the case of a quadrilateral with two equal sides), each of the two sides is 13 <em>hastas</em> in measure. The base here is 14<em>hastas</em>, and the top-side is 4 <em>hastas</em>. What is the measure of the (basal) segments (caused by the inner perpendicular) and what of the inner perpendicular (itself) ?</p>
<p>186$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of the (quadrilateral) figure above-mentioned, the measures of the top-side and the base are each to be taken to be less by 1 <em>hasta</em>. From the top of each of the two perpendiculars, a string is stretched so as to reach the foot (of the other perpendicular). You give out the measures of the inner perpendicular and of the basal segments (caused thereby).</p>
<p>187$\frac{1}{2}$. (In the case of a quadrilateral with unequal sides), one side is 13 <em>hastas</em> in measure ; the opposite side is 15 <em>hastas</em>; tho top-side is 7 <em>hastas</em>; and the base here is 21 <em>hastas</em> What are the values of the inner perpendicular and of the basal segments (caused thereby) ?</p>
<p>185$\frac{1}{2}$. Here a quadrilateral with two equal sides is given; in the next stanza a quadrilateral with three equal sides, and in the one next to it aquadrilateral with unequal sides are given. In all these cases the diagonals of the quadrilateral have to be first found out in accordance with the rule given in stanzaVII-54, and then the measures of the perpendiculars from the ends of the top-side to the baseas also the measures of the segments of the base caused by those perpendiculars have to be arrived at by the application of the rule given in stanzaVII.49. Then taking these measures of the perpendiculars to be those of the pillars, the rule given in stanza 180$\frac{1}{2}$ above is applied to arrive at the measures of the inner perpendicular and the basal segments caused thereby. The problem given in stanza 187$\frac{1}{2}$ is however worked in a slightly different way in the Kanarese commentary. The top-side is supposed to be parallel to the base, and the measures of the perpendicular and of the basal segments caused thereby are arrived at by constructing a triangle whose sides are the two sides of the quadrilateral, and whose base is equal to the difference between the base and the top-side of the quadrilateral.</p>
<p>188$\frac{1}{2}$-189$\frac{1}{2}$. There is an equilateral quadrilateral figure, measuring 20 <em>hastas</em> at the side. From the four angles of that(figure) strings are stretched out so as to reach the middle point of the (opposite) sides, (this being done) in respect of all the four sides. What may be the measure of each of the strings so stretched out ? In the interior of such (a quadrilateral figure with strings so stretched out), what may be the value of the (inner) perpendicular and of the basal segments (caused thereby) ?</p>
<p>The measure of the height of the pillar is known. For some reason or other that pillar gets broken and (the upper part of the broken pillar) falls (to the ground, the lower end of the broken off part, however, remaining in contact with the top of the lower part). Then the basal distance between the foot of the pillar and its top (now on the ground) is ascertained. And (here is) the rule for arriving at the numerical value of the measure of the remaining part of the pillar measured from its foot:-</p>
<p>190$\frac{1}{2}$. The half of the difference between the square of the total height and the square of the (known) measure of the basal distance, when divided by the total height, gives rise to the measure of what remains unbroken. What is left thereafter (out of the total height) is the measure of the broken part.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>191$\frac{1}{2}$. The height of a pillar is 25 <em>hastas</em>. It is broken somewhere between (the top and the foot). The distance between the (fallen) top (on the floor) and the foot of the pillar is 5 <em>hastas</em>. How far away (from the foot) is it (viz., the pillar) broken ?</p>
<p><strong>188$\frac{1}{2}$-189</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The figure contemplated In this problem seems to be this:-</p>

<p>The inner perpendiculars referred to herein are GH and KL. To find out these, FE isfirst determined. FE, according to the commentary, is said to be equal to $\sqrt{\frac{CM^{2}}{2}~ - ~\left\{ DM^{2}~ + ~DE^{2}~ + ~\left( \frac{1}{2}~DM \right)^{2} \right\}}$. Then with FE and BC or AD taken aspillars, the rule under reference may be applied.</p>
<p>190$\frac{1}{2}$. If ABC is a right-angled triangle, and if the measures of AC and of the son of AB and BC are given, then AB and BC can be found out from the fact that <em>B**C</em>²=<em>A**B</em>²+<em>A**C</em>².The formula given in the rule is $AB~ = ~\frac{(AB~ + ~BC)^{2}~ - ~AC^{2}}{2~(AB~ + ~BC)}$; and this can be easily proved to be true from the above equality.</p>

<p>192$\frac{1}{2}$. There are 49 <em>hastas</em> in the measurement of the height of a bamboo (as it is growing). It is broken somewhere between (the top and the bottom). The distance (between the fallen top on the floor and the bottom of the bamboo) is 21 <em>hastas</em>. How far away (from the foot) is it broken ?</p>
<p>193$\frac{1}{2}$-195$\frac{1}{2}$. The height of a certain tree is 20 <em>hastas</em>. A certain man seated on the top (of it) threw down a fruit thereof along a path forming a hypotenuse. Then another man standing at the foot of the tree went towards that fruit taking a path representing the other side (i.e., the base of the triangle in the situation) and received that fruit. The sum of the distances travelled by that fruit and this man turned out to be 50 <em>hastas</em>. What is the numerical value of the hypotenuse representing the path of that fruit? What may be the measure of the other siderepresenting the path of the man who was at the foot of the tree?</p>
<p>The numerical value (of the height) of a taller pillar as also the numerical value (of the height) of a shorter pillar is known. Tho numerical value (of the length) of the intervening space between the two pillars is also known. The taller (of the two pillars) gets broken and falls so that the top thereof rests on the top of the shorter pillar, (the other end of the broken bit of the taller pillar being in contact with the top of the remaining portion thereof). And now the rule for arriving at the numerical value (of the length) of the broken part of the taller pillar as also at the numerical value (of the height) of the remaining part (of the same taller pillar):-</p>
<p>196$\frac{1}{2}$. From the square of (the numerical measure of) the taller (pillar), the sum of the square of the measure of the shorter(pillar) and the square of that of the base is subtracted. Half (of the resulting remainder) is divided by the difference between (the measures of) the two pillars. The quotient gives rise to the measure of the height (of the standing part) of the broken (pillar).</p>
<p>196$\frac{1}{2}$. If <em>a</em> represents the height of the taller pillar and<em>b</em> that of the shorter pillar,<em>c</em> the length of the intervening space between them, and <em>a₁</em> the height of the standing portion of the broken pillar, then, according to the rule,<br>
$a_{1}~ = ~\frac{a^{2}~ - ~\left( b^{2}~ + ~c^{2} \right)}{2(a~ - ~b)}$;

<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>197$\frac{1}{2}$. One pillar is 5 <em>hastas</em> in height; similarly another pillar, which is the taller, is 23 <em>hastas</em> (in height).

<p>Taking two-thirds of the numerical value of the vertical side of a longish quadrilateral as the height of amountain, the rule for arriving, with the aid of the numerical value of the height of that mountain, at the numerical values of the horizontal sideand of the diagonal of that longish quadrilateral:-</p>
<p>198$\frac{1}{2}$. Twice the height of the mountain is the measure of the distance between the (foot of the) mountain and the city (there). Half (the height) of the mountain is the measure (of the distance) of the upward flight in the sky. The diagonal is arrived at on adding together half the height of the mountain and the distance (of the city from the foot of the mountain).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>199$\frac{1}{2}$-200$\frac{1}{2}$. On a mountain having a height of 6 <em>yōjanas</em> there were 2ascetics. One of them went walking on foot. The otherwas capable of moving in the sky. This asceticflew up and then came down to the city taking the hypotenuse course. The other asceticdescended from the summit (vertically) to the foot of the mountain (and walked along) to the city. (It was found that) both of them had travelled over the same distance. (What is) the distance of the city (from the foot of the mountain) and what the height of the flight upwards ?</p>
<p>In an area representable by a (suspended) swing (and its vertical supports resting on the ground), the measures of the heights of either two pillars or two hill-tops are taken to be the measures of the horizontal sides of two longish quadrilateral figures. Then, (with the aid of these known horizontal sides and) in relation to the base line either between the two hills or between the two pillars, (as the case may be), the values of the two segments (caused by the meeting point of the perpendicular) are arrived at. Those two segments are written down in the inverse order. The values of the two segments so written down in the inverse order are taken to be the values of the two perpendicular sides of the two longish qundrilateral figures. And, now, the rule for arriving at the equal numerical value of the diagonals of those (two longish quadrilateral figures) :-</p>
<p><strong>199$\frac{1}{2}$-200</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. If in the marginal figure, <em>a</em> represents the height of the mountain,<em>b</em> the distance of the city from the foot of the mountain, and<em>c</em> the length of the hypotenus course, then <em>a</em> is, according to the supposition made in the preamble to the rulein 198$\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{2}{3}$of the side AB.

<p>As the courses of the two asceticsare equal,<br>

<p>The three formulas marked I, II and III above are those given in the rule.</p>
<p>201$\frac{1}{2}$-203$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to a figure representable by a (suspended) swing (and its vertical supports resting on the ground), the measures of the heights of either two pillars or two hills are taken, to be the measures of the two sides of a triangle. Then, in relation to the value of the base (line) enclosed between those twosides (which has to be the same in value as the baseline between the given pillars or hills), the segments (of the basecaused by the meeting of the perpendicular from the vertex with the base) are arrived at in accordance with the rule laid down already. If the values of these (segments) are written down in the inverseorder, they become the values of the two perpendicular sides of the two longish quadrilaterals in the required operation. Then, in accordance with the rule given already, the values of the diagonals of the two longish quadrilateral figures may be arrived at with the aid of the values of those two sides (of the triangleabove mentioned which are taken here as the two horizontal sides of the longish quadrilateral) and of those two perpendicular sides. These (diagonals) are of equal numerical value.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>204 1/2-205. One pillar is 13 (<em>hastas</em> in height). The other is 15 (<em>hastas</em> in height). The intervening distance (between them) is 14 (<em>hastas</em>). A rope (having its two ends) tied to the tops (of these two pillars) hangs down so as to touch the ground (some where between the two pillars). What are the values of the two segments, (so caused, of the base-line between the pillars) ?The two (hanging) parts of the rope are (in their length) of equal numerical value. Give out also the rope-measure.</p>
<p><strong>201$\frac{1}{2}$-203$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>. In the two quadrilaterals of the kind contemplated in this rule, let the vertical sides be represented by <em>a, b</em>; let the base be <em>c</em>; and let c₁, c₂, be its segments and <em>l</em> the length of each of the equal portions of the rope.</p>

<p>206-207$\frac{1}{2}$. The height of (one) hill is 22 (<em>yōjanas</em>). That of another hill is 18 (<em>yōjanas</em>). The intervening spacebetween the two hills is 20 (<em>yōjanas</em>in length). There stand two religious mendicants, (one) on the top of each, who can move along the sky. For the purpose of begging (their food), they (came downthrough the sky and) met in the city there (between the hills); and it turned out that they had travelled (along the sky) over equal distances. (Under these circumstances), of what numerical value were the segments (of the basal line between the two hills) ? Of what value, O you who know calculation, is the numerical measure of the equal distance travelled in this (area) representable by a (suspended) swing.</p>
<p>208$\frac{1}{2}$-209$\frac{1}{2}$. The height of one hill is 20 <em>yōjanas</em>; and similarly, that of another (bill) is 24 <em>yōjanas</em>. The intervening space between them is 22 <em>yōjanas</em>(in length). Two mendicants, who stayed on the tops of these two hills, (one on each), and were able to move through the sky, came down, for the purpose of begging their food, to the city situated between those (two hills), and were found to have travelled (along the sky) over equal distances. What is the measure (of the length) of the intervening space between that (city) in the middle and the hills (on either side).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the number of daysrequired for the meeting together of two persons moving with unequal speed along a course representable by (the boundary of) a triangle consisting of (three) unequal sides :-</p>
<p>210$\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of the squares (of the numerical values) of the daily speeds (of the two men) is divided by the difference between the squares of the values of (those same) daily speeds. The quotient (so obtained) is multiplied by the number of days spend(by one of the men) in travelling northwards (before travelling to the south-east to meet the other man). The meeting together of (these) two men takes place at the end of the number of days measured by this product.</p>
<p><strong>210</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The course contemplated here is that along the sides of a right angled triangle. The formula given in the rule, if algebraically represented, is
$x~ = ~\frac{b^{2}~ + ~a^{2}}{b_{2}~ - ~a^{2}}~ \times ~d$,where<em>x</em> is the number of days taken to go through the hypotenuse course, <em>a</em> and<em>b</em> the rates of journey of the two men, and <em>d</em> the number of days taken in going northwards. This follows from the under mentioned equation which isbased on the data given in the problem :-<br>
<em>b</em>²<em>x</em>²=<em>d</em>²<em>b</em>²+(<em>x</em>+<em>d</em>)²×<em>a</em>².</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>211$\frac{1}{2}$-212$\frac{1}{2}$. The man who travels to the east moves at the rate of 2 <em>yōjanas</em>(a day); and the other man who travels northwards moves at the rate of 3 <em>yōjanas</em>(a day). This (latter man) having thus moved on for 5 days turns to move along the hypotenuse. In how many days will he meet the (other) man? Both (of them) move out at the same time, and the number of days spent (by both of them) in journeying out is the same.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical value of the diameters of circles described about the eight kinds of figures consisting of the five kinds of quadrilateral figures and the three kinds of triangular figures (already mentioned) :-</p>
<p>213$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a quadrilateral figure, the value of the diagonal (thereof), divided by that of the perpendicular, and (then) multiplied by that of the lateral side, gives rise to the value of the diameter of the circumscribed circle. In the case of a trilateral figure, the product of the values of the two sides (other than the base) divided by the value of the perpendicular (gives rise to the required diameter of the circumscribed circle).</p>

The value of the given diameter (of the circle) is divided by the value of the (hypothetically) arrived diameter of the circle (described about an optionally chosen figure belonging tothe specified variety). The values of the sides (of this optionally chosen figure) should be multiplied by the resulting quotient (arrived at as mentioned above). Thus, the numerical values of the sides of the figure produced (in the given circle) are deduced.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>222$\frac{1}{2}$. The diameter of a circular figure is 13. O friend, think out well and tell me the (various measurements relating to the) eight different kinds of figures beginning with the square which are (inscribed) in this (circle).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the diameter of the circular figure inscribed within the various (kinds of quadrilateral and trilateral) figures mentioned before, with the exception of the longish quadrilateral figure, when the accurate measure of the area and the numerical value of the perimeter are known in relation to (those same) quadrilateral and other figures:-</p>
<p>223$\frac{1}{2}$. The (known) accurate measure of the area of any of the figures other than the longish quadrilateral figure should be divided by a quarter of the numerical value of the perimeter (of that figure).

That which happens to be the square root of the difference between the squares of the (known) values of the diameter and the bow-string line (relating to the given circle) - that has to be subtracted from the value of the diameter.

<p>The rule for arriving at the namerical value of the diameter of a (given) circle when the numerical values of the (related)bow-string line and the arrow line are known :-</p>
<p>229$\frac{1}{2}$. The quantity representing the square of the value of the bow-string line is divided by the value of the arrow line as multiplied by <em>four</em>. Then the value of the arrow lineis added (to the resulting quotient). What is so obtained is pointed out to be the measure of the breadth of the regular circle measured through the centre.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>

<p>When two regular circles cut each other, there arises a fishshaped figure. In relation to that fish-shaped figure, the line going from the mouth to the tail (thereof) should be drawn. With the aid of this line, there will come into existence the outlines of two bowsapplied to each other face to face. The line drawn from the mouth to the tail (of the fish-figure) happens to be itself the bow-string line in relation to both these bows. The two arrow lines in relation to both these bows are themselves to be understood as forming the two arrow lines connected with the mutually overlapping circles. And the rule here is to arriveat the values of the arrow lines connected with the overlapping portion when two regular circles out each other :-</p>

I shall now give out the (three) varieties of <em>karmāntik</em>, <em>auṇḍraphala</em>, and <em>sūkṣmaphala</em>(in relation to excavations), which varieties are all derived from those various kinds of geometrical figures, mentioned before, as results obtained by multiplying them by (quantities measuring) depth. This seventh subject of treatment is the subject of excavations.</p>
<p>A stanza regarding the conventional assumption (implied in this chapter) :-</p>
<p>3<sup id="fnref:253"><a href="#fn:253" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">253</a></sup>. The quantity of earth required to fill an excavation measuring one cubic <em>hasta</em> is 3,200 <em>palas</em>. From that (same cubicvolume of excavation) 3,600 <em>palas</em> (of earth) may be taken out.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the cubical contents of excavations :-</p>
<p>4<sup id="fnref:254"><a href="#fn:254" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">254</a></sup>. Area multiplied by depth gives rise to the approximatemeasure of the cubical contents in a regular excavation. The sums of (all the various) top dimensions with the correspondingbottom dimensions are halved; and then (these halved quantities of the same denomination are all added, and their sum is) divided by the number of the said (halved quantities). Such is the process of arriving at the average equivalent value.</p>
<p><em>Examples in iilustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>In relation to (an equilateral) quadrilateral area (representing the section of a regular excavation), the sides and the depth are 8 <em>hastas</em> (each in measure). In respect of this regular excavation, what may be the value of the cubical contents here ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to an (equilateral) triangular area (representing the section of a regular excavation), the sides are 32 <em>hastas</em> each, and in the depth there are found 36 <em>hastas</em> and 6 <em>aṅgulas</em>. What is the calculation (of the contents) here ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to a (regular) circular area representing (the section of) a regular excavation, the diameter is 108 <em>hastas</em>, and the depth (of the excavation) is 165 <em>hastas</em>. (Now), give out what the cubical contents are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to a longish quadrilateral area (forming the section) of a regular excavation, the breadth is 25 <em>hastas</em>, the side (measuring the length) is 60 <em>hastas</em> and the depth (of the excavation) is 108 <em>hastas</em>. Quickly give out (the cubical contents of this regular excavation).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the accurate value of the cubical contents in the calculation relating to excavations, after knowing the result designated <em>karmāntika</em>as well as the result designated <em>auṇḍra a</em>nd with the aid of these results :-</p>
<p>9.-11$\frac{1}{2}$. The values of the base and the other sides of the figure representing the top sectional area are added respectively to the values of the base and the corresponding sides of the figure representing the bottom sectional area. The (several) sums (soarrived at) are divided by the number of the sectional areas taken into consideration (in the problem). The (resulting) quantities aremultiplied with each other (as required by the rules bearing upon the finding out of areas when the values of the sides are known) The area (so arrived at), when multiplied by the depth, gives riseto the cubical measure designated the <em>karmāntika</em> result. In the case of those same figures representing the top sectional area and the bottom sectional area, the value of the area of (each of) these figures is (separately) arrived at. The area values (so obtained) are added together and then divided by the number of (sectional) areas (taken into consideration). The quotient (so obtained) ismultiplied by the value of the depth. This gives rise to (the cubical measure designated) the <em>auṇḍra</em> result. If one-third ofthe difference between these two results is added to the <em>karmāntika</em> result, it indeed becomes the accurate value (of the required cubical contents).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>12$\frac{1}{2}$. There is a well whose (sectional) area happens to be an equilateral quadrilateral. The value (of each of the sides) of the top (sectional area) is 20 (<em>hastas</em>), and that (of each of the sides) of the bottom (sectional area) is only 16 (<em>hastas</em>). The depth is 9 (<em>hastas</em>). O you who know calculation, tell me quickly what the cubical measure here is.</p>
<p>13$\frac{1}{2}$. There is a well whose (sectional) area happens to be an equilateral triangular figure. The value (of each of the sides) of the top (sectional area) is 20 (<em>hastas</em>), and that (of each of thesides) of the bottom (sectional area) is 16; the depth is 9 (<em>hastas</em>). What is the value of the <em>karmāntika</em> cubical measure, of the<em>auṇḍra</em> cubical measure, and of the accurate cubical measure here?</p>
<p><strong>9-11</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The figures dealt with in this rule are truncated pyramidswith rectangular or triangular bases, or truncated cones all of which have to be conceived as turned upside down. The rule deals with three different kinds of measures of the cubical contents of excavations. Of these, two, viz, the <em>Karmāntika</em> and <em>Auṇḍra</em> measures give only the approximate values of the contents. The accurate measure is calculated with the help of these values. If K represents the <em>Karmāntika-phala</em> and A represents the <em>Auṇḍra-phala</em> then the accurate measure is said to be equal to $\frac{A~ - ~K}{3}~ + ~K,~i.e.,~\frac{2}{3}K~ + ~\frac{1}{3}A$.If <em>a</em>and<em>b</em> be the measures of a side of the top and bottom surfaces respectively of a truncated pyramid with a square base, it can be easily shown that the accurate measure of the cubical contents is equal to$\frac{1}{3}h~ + ~\left( a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}~ + ~ab \right)$, where<em>h</em> is the height of the truncated pyramid. The formula given in the rule for the accurate measure of the cubical contents may be verified to be the same as this with the help of the following values for the <em>Karmāntika</em> and <em>Auṇḍra</em> results given in the rule :-<br>
$K~ = ~\left( \frac{a + ~b}{2} \right)^{2}~ \times ~h~;~~~A~ = ~\frac{a^{2}~ + ~b^{2}}{2}~ \times ~h$.</p>
<p>Similar verifications may be arrived at in the case of truncated pramide having an equilateral triangle or a rectangle for the base, and also in the case of truncated cones.</p>
<p>14$\frac{1}{2}$. There is a well whose(sectional) area happens to beregularly circular. The (diameter of the top (sectional area) is 20 <em>daṇḍas</em>, and that of the bottom (sectional area) is only 16 <em>daṇḍas</em>. The depth is 12 <em>daṇḍas</em>. What may be the <em>karmāntika</em>, the auṇḍra, and the accurate cubical measures here ?</p>
<p>15$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to (an excavation whose sectional area happens to be) a longish quadrilateral figure (i.e., oblong), the length at the top is 60 (<em>hastas</em>), the breadth is 12 (<em>hastas</em>); at the bottom, these are (respectively) half(of what they measure at the top). The depth is8 (<em>hastas</em>). What is the cabical measure here?</p>
<p>16$\frac{1}{2}$. (Hereis another well of the same kind), the lengths (of whose sectional areas) at the top, at the middle, and at the bottom are (respectively) 90, 80, and 70 (<em>hastas</em>), and the breadths are (respectively) 32, 16, and 10 <em>hastas</em>. This is 7 (<em>hastas</em>) in depth. (Find out the required cubical measure.)</p>
<p>17$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to (an excavation whose sectional area happens to be) a regular circle, the diameter at the mouth is 60 (<em>hastas</em>), in the middle 30 (<em>hastas</em>), and at the bottom 15 (<em>hastas</em>). The depth is 16 <em>hastas</em>. What is the calculated result giving its cubical measure ?</p>
<p>18$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to (an excavation whose sectional area happens to be) a triangle, each of the three sides measures 80 <em>hastas</em> at the top, 60 <em>hastas</em> in the middle, and 50 <em>hastas</em> at the bottom. The depth is 9 <em>hastas</em>. What is the calculated result giving its cubical contents ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the cubical contents of a ditch, as also for arriving at the value of the cubical contents of an excavation having in the middle (of it) a tapering projection (of solid earth) :-</p>
<p>19$\frac{1}{2}$-20$\frac{1}{2}$. The breadth (of the central mass) increased by the top-breadth of the surrounding ditch, and (then) multiplied bythree, gives rise to the value of the (required) perimeter in the case of triangular and circular excavations. In the case of a quadrilateral excavation, (this same value of the required perimeter results) by multiplying the quantity <em>four</em> (with the value of the breadth as before).</p>
<p>In the case of excavations having central masses tapering upwards or downwards the operation (for <em>Karmāntikaphala</em>) is (to add the value of) half the breadth of the excavation to (that of the breadth of) the central mass, and (for <em>Auṇḍraphala</em>), to add (the value of) the breadth (of the excavation to the value of the breadth of the central mass); then (the procedure is) as (given) before.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>21 1/2. The already mentioned trilateral, quadrilateral, and circular (areas) have ditches thrown round them. The breadth measures 80 <em>daṇḍas</em>, and the ditches are as much as 4 (<em>daṇḍas</em>) in breadth, and 3 (<em>daṇḍas</em>) in depth. (Find out the cubical contents.)</p>
<p><strong>19$\frac{1}{2}$-20</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. These stanzas deal with the measurement of the cubiccontents of a ditch dug round a central mass of earth of any shape. The central mass may be in section a square, a rectangle, an equilateral triangle, or a circle ;and the excavation may be of the same width both at the bottom and the top,or may be of diminishing or increasing width. The ruleenables us to find out the total length of the ditch in all these cases.</p>
<p>I. When the width of the ditch is uniform, the length of ditch =(<em>d</em>+<em>b</em>)×3 in the case of an equilateral triangular or circular ditch, where <em>d</em> is the measure of a side or of the diameter of the central mass and <em>b</em> is the width of the ditch: but this length =(<em>d</em>+<em>b</em>)×4 in the case of a squareexcavation with a central mass, square in section.</p>
<p>II. When the ditch is tapering to a point at the bottom or the top, the length of the ditch forfinding out the <em>Karmāntika-phala</em> $= ~\left( d~ + ~\frac{b}{2} \right)~ \times ~3,~or~\left( d~ \times ~\frac{b}{2} \right)~ \times ~4$, according as the central mass (1) is in section trilateral or circular, or (2) square.</p>
<p>Length of ditch for finding out Auṇḍra-phala =(<em>d</em>+<em>b</em>)×3 and (<em>d</em>+<em>b</em>)×4 respectively.</p>
<p>These expressions have to be multiplied by half of the width of the ditch and by its depth for finding out the respective cubical <em>phalas</em>. The formulas given above in relation to triangular and circular excavations give only approximate results. With the aid of the total length of the ditch so obtained, the cubical contents are found out in the case of ditches with sloping sides by applying the rule given in stanzas 9 to 11$\frac{1}{2}$above.</p>
<p>22$\frac{1}{2}$. The length of a longishquadrilateral is 120 (<em>daṇḍas</em>) and the breadth is 40. The ditch around is as big as 4 <em>daṇḍas</em>in breadth and 3 in depth. (Find out the cubical contents.)</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the cubical contents of an excavation, when the depth of the excavation varies (at various points), and also for arriving, when the cubical contents of an excavation are known, at the depth of digging necessary in the case of another (known) area (so that the cubical contents may be the same) :-</p>
<p>23$\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of the depths (measured in different places) is divided by the number of places; this gives rise to the average) depth. This multiplied by the top area (of the excavation) gives rise to the (required) cubical contents of the excavation in the casewhere that areais trilateral, quadrilateral or circular. The cubical contents (of a given excavation), when divided by the (known) value of another area, gives rise to the depth (to which there should be digging, so that the resulting cubical contents may be the same).</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>24 1/2. In an equilateral quadrilateral field, the ground covered by which has an extent measured by 4 <em>hastas</em> (in length and breadth), the excavations are (in depth) 1, 2, 3, and 4 <em>hastas</em> (in four different cases). What is the measure of the average depth of the excavations) ?</p>
<p>25$\frac{1}{2}$. There is a well with an equilateral quadrilateral section, the sides whereof are 18 <em>hastas</em> in measure; its depth is 4<em>hastas</em>. With the water of this (well), another well measuring 9 <em>hastas</em> at each of the sides (of the section) is filled. What is the depth (of this other well) ?</p>
<p>22 1/2. For finding out the total length of the surrounding ditch when the central mass of earth is rectangular in section, the measures of the sides as increased by the width or half the width of the ditch are added together, according as the <em>Karmāntika</em>or the <em>Auṇḍra</em> result is required.</p>
<p>When the measures of the sides of the top (sectional area) and also of the bottom (sectional area) are known, and when the measure of the depth also is known, in relation to a certain given excavation, the rulefor arriving at the value of the sides (ofthe resulting bottom section) at any optionally given depth, and also for arriving at the (resulting) depth (of theexcavation) if the bottom is reduced to a mere point :-</p>
<p>26$\frac{1}{2}$. The product resulting from multiplying the (given) depth with (the given measure of a side at the) top, when divided by the difference between the measures of the top side and the bottom side gives rise here to the (required) depth (when the bottom is) made to end in a point. The depth measured (from the pointed bottom) upwards (to the position required) multiplied by (the measure of the sideat) the top and (then) divided by the sum of the side measure, if any, at the pointed bottom and the (total) depth (from the top to the pointed bottom), gives rise to the side measure (of the excavation at the required depth).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>27$\frac{1}{2}$. There is a well with an equilateral quadrilateral section. The(side) measure at the top is 20 and at the bottom 14. The depth given in the beginning is 9. (This depth has to be) further (carried) down by 3. What will be the side value (of the bottom here) ?What is the measure of the depth, (if the bottom is) made to end in a point ?</p>
<p><strong>26</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The problems contemplated in this stanzaare (a) to find out the full latitude of an invertedpyramid or cone and (b) to find out the dimensions of the cross section thereof at a desired level, when the altitude and the dimensions of the top and bottom surfaces of a truncated pyramid or one are given. If, in a truncated pyramid with square base, <em>a</em>is the measure of a side of the base and <em>b</em> that of a side of the top surface and <em>h</em> the height, then according to the rule given here, Htaken the height of the whole pyramid$= ~\frac{a~ \times ~h}{a~ - ~b}$and the measure of a side of the cross section of the pyramid at any given height represented by $h_{1}~ = ~\frac{a\left( H~ - ~h_{1} \right)}{H}$.</p>
<p>These formulas are applicable in the case of a cone as well. In the rule the measure of the side of section forming the pointed out of the pyramid is required to be added to H, the denominator in the second formula for the reason that in some cases the pyramid may not actually end in a point. Where, however, it does end in a point, the value of this side has to be zero as a matter of course.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the value of the cubical contents of a spherically bounded space :-</p>
<p>28$\frac{1}{2}$. The half of the cube of half the diameter, multiplied by <em>pine</em>, gives the approximate value of the cubical contents of a sphere. This (approximate value), multiplied by <em>nine</em> and divided by <em>ten</em> on neglecting the remainder, gives rise to the accurate value of the cubical measure.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>29$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of a sphere measuring 16 in diameter, calculate and tell me what the approximate value of (its) cubical measure is, and also the accurate measure (thereof).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the approximate value as well as the accurate value of the cubical contents of an excavation in the form of a triangular pyramid, (the height whereof is taken to be equal to the length of one of the sides of the equilateral triangle forming the base) :-</p>
<p><strong>28$\frac{1}{2}$</strong>. The volume of a sphere as given here is (1) approximately $= ~\left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^{3}~ \times ~\frac{9}{2}$and (2) accurately $= ~\left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^{3}~ \times ~\frac{9}{2}~ \times \frac{9}{10}$. The correct formula for the cubical contents of a sphere is$\frac{4}{3}{\pi r}^{3}$; and this becomes comparable with the abovo value, if is taken to be v 10. Both the MSS. read तन्नवमांशं दशगुणं,making it appear that the accurate value is  of the approximate value;but the text adopted is तद्दशमांशं नवगुणं which makes the accurate value  of the approximate one. It is easy to see that this gives a more accurate result in regard to the measure of the cubical contents of a sphere than the other reading.</p>
<p>30$\frac{1}{2}$. The cube of half the square of the side (of the basal equilateral triangle) is multiplied by <em>ten</em>; and the square root (of the resulting product is) divided by <em>nine</em>. This gives rise to the approximately calculated value (required). (This approximate) value, when multiplied by <em>three</em> and divided by the square root of<em>ten</em>, gives rise to the accurately calculated cubical contents of the pyramidal excavation.</p>
<p>An example in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>31$\frac{1}{2}$. Calculate and say what the approximatevalue and the accurate value of the cubical measure of a triangular pyramid are, the side of the (basal) triangle whereof is 6 in length.</p>
<p>When the pipes leading into a well are(all) open, the rule for arriving at the value of the time taken to fill the well with water, when any number of optionally chosen pipes are together (allowed to fill the well).</p>
<p>32$\frac{1}{2}$-33. (The number <em>one</em> representing) each of the pipes is divided by the time corresponding to each of them (separately); and (the resulting quotients represented as fractions) are reduced so as to have a common denominator ; <em>one</em> divided by the sum of these (fractions with the common denominator) gives the fraction of the day (within which the well would become filled) by all the pipes (pouring in their water) together. Those (fractions with the common denominator) multiplied by this resulting fraction of the day give rise to the measures of the flow of water (separately through each of the various pipes) into that well.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="34">
<li>There are 4 pipes (leading into a well). Among them, each fills the well (in order) in $\frac{1}{2},~\frac{1}{3},~\frac{1}{4},~\frac{1}{5}$ of a day. In how much of a day will all of them (together fill the well, and each of them to what extent) ?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Fourth Subject of Treatment named Rule of Three, an example (like this) has (already) been given merely as a hint; thesubject (of that example) is expanded here and is given out in detail.</p>
<p><strong>30</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically represented the approximate value of the cubicalcontents of a triangular pyramid according to the rule comes to $\frac{a^{3}}{18}~ \times ~\sqrt{5},~i.e.,~\frac{a^{3}}{12}~ \times ~\frac{\sqrt{20}}{9};$ and the accurate value becomes equal to $\frac{a^{3}}{12}~ \times ~\sqrt{2};$ wherea gives the measure of the altitude of the pyramid as also of a side of the basal equilateral triangle.</p>
<p>It may be easily seen that both these values are somewhat wide of the mark and that the given approximate value is nearer the correct value than the so-called accurate value.</p>
<p>35-36. There is at the foot of a hill a well of an equilaterally quadrilateral section measuring 9 <em>hastas</em> in each of the (three) dimensions. From the top of the hill there runs a water channel, the section whereof is (uniformly) an equilateral quadrilateral having 1 <em>aṅgula</em> for the measure of a side. (As soon as the water flowing through that channel begins to fall into the well), the stream is broken off at the top; and (yet), with it (that well) becomes filled in with water. Tell me the height of the hill and also the measure of the water in the well.</p>
<p>37-38$\frac{1}{2}$. There is at the foot of a hill a well of an equilaterally quadrilateral section measuring 9 <em>hastas</em> in each of the (three) dimensions. From the top of the hill, there runs a water channel, (the section whereof is throughout a circle of 1 <em>aṅgula</em> in diameter. As soon as the water (flowing through the channel) begins to fall into the well, the stream is broken off at the top. With the water filling the whole of the channel, that well becomes filled. O friend, calculate and tell me the height of the mountain and also the measure of the water.</p>
<p>39$\frac{1}{2}$-40$\frac{1}{2}$. There is at the foot of a hill a well of an equilaterally quadrilateral section measuring 9 <em>hastas</em> in (each of the) three dimensions. From the top of the hill there runs a water channel, (the section whereof is throughout) triangular, each side measuring 1<em>aṅgula</em>. As soon as the water (flowing through that channel) begins to fall into the well, the stream is broken off at the top. With the water (filling the whole of the channel) that (well) becomes filled. O friend, calculate and tell (me) the height of the mountain and the measure of the water.</p>
<p>35 to 42$\frac{1}{2}$. The reference here is to the example given in stanzas 15 - 16 of chapter V - side also the footnote thereunder.</p>
<p>The volume of the water is probably intended to be expressed in <em>vāhas</em>. (Vide the table relating to this kind of volume measure in stanzas 36 to 38, chapter I.) It is stated in the Kanarese commentary that 1 cubic <em>aṅgula</em> of water is equal to 1 <em>kaṛṣa</em>. Then according to the table given in stanza 41 of chapter I, 4 <em>kaṛṣas</em>make one <em>pala</em> , according to stanza 44 in the same chapter, 12$\frac{1}{2}$ <em>palas</em>make one <em>prastha</em> and stanzas 36 to 37 therein give the relation of the <em>prastha</em>to the <em>vāha</em>.</p>
<p>41$\frac{1}{2}$-42$\frac{1}{2}$. There is at the foot of a hill a well of an equilaterally quadrilateral section measuring 9 <em>hastas</em> in (each of the) three dimensions. (From the top of the hill) there runs a water channel, (the section whereof is uniformly) 1 <em>aṅgula</em> broad at the bottom, 1 <em>aṅgula</em> at (each of) the dug (side slopes), and 2 <em>aṅgulas</em>in length (at the top). As soon as thewater (flowing through that channel) begins to fall into the well, the stream is broken off at the top. With the water (filling the whole of the channel) that well becomes filled. What is the height of the hill and (what) the measure of the water ?</p>
<p>Thus ends the section on accurate measurements in the calculations relating to excavations.</p>
<p><strong>Calculations Relating to Piles (of Bricks)</strong></p>
<p>Hereafter, in (this) chapter treating of operations relating to excavations, we will expound calculations relating to (brick) piles. Here there is this convention (regarding the unit brick).</p>
<p>43$\frac{1}{2}$. The (unit) brick is 1 <em>hasta</em> in length, half of that in breadth, and 4 <em>aṅgulas</em>in thickness. With such (bricks all) operations are to be carried out.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the cubical contents of a given excavation in a field and also at the number of bricks corresponding to the above cubical contents.</p>
<p>44$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:255"><a href="#fn:255" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">255</a></sup>. The area at the mouth (of the excavation) is multiplied by the depth ; this (resulting product) is divided by the cubicmeasure of the(unit) brick. The quotient so obtained is to be understood as the (cubical) measure of a (brick) pile; that same(quotient) also happens to be the measure of the number of the bricks.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>45$\frac{1}{2}$. There is a raised platform equilaterally quadrilateral (in section) having a side measure of 8 <em>hastas</em> and a height of 9<em>hastas</em>. That (platform) is built up of bricks. O you who know calculation, say how many bricks there are (in it).</p>
<p>46$\frac{1}{2}$. A raised platform, equilaterally triangular (in section), having 8 <em>hastas</em> (as its side measure), and 9 <em>hastas</em> as height, has been constructed with the aforesaid bricks. Calculate and say how many bricks there are in this (structure).</p>
<p>47$\frac{1}{2}$. A raised platform, circular in section, having a diameter of 8 <em>hastas</em> and a height of 9 <em>hastas</em> is built up with (the same aforesaid) bricks. O you who know calculation, say how many bricks there are in it.</p>
<p>48$\frac{1}{2}$. In the case of (a raised platform having) an oblong(section), the length is 60 <em>hastas</em>, the breadth 25 <em>hastas</em>, and the height is 6 <em>hastas</em>. Give out in this case the measure of that brick<br>
pile.</p>
<p>49$\frac{1}{2}$. A boundary wall is 7 <em>hastas</em> in thickness, 24 <em>hastas</em> in length and 20 <em>hastas</em> in height. How many are the bricks used in building it ?</p>
<p>50$\frac{1}{2}$. The thickness of a boundary wall is 6 <em>hastas</em> at the top and 8 <em>hastas</em> at the bottom; its length is 24 <em>hastas</em> and height 20 <em>hastas</em>. How many are the bricks used in building it ?</p>
<p>51$\frac{1}{2}$. (In the case of a raised sloping platform), the heights are (respectively) 12, 16 and 20 <em>hastas</em> (at three different points);the measures of the breadth at the bottom are (respectively) 7, 6 and 5, (the same) at the top being 4, 3 and 2 <em>hastas</em>; thelength is 24 <em>hastas</em>. (Find out the number of bricks in the pile).</p>
<p><strong>50$\frac{1}{2}$-51</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. In finding out the cubical contents of the wall, the average breadth calculated according to the rule, given in the latter half of stanza 4above, is used; so the <em>Karmāntika</em> value is taken into consideration here.</p>
<figure class="">

    <a href="../books_images/1675078614.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p><strong>51</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. This sloping platform is bounded at its two ends by two vertical planes, the top and the side surfaces alone being sloping. The top forms an inclinedplane, the breadth of which is 2<em>hastas</em> at the raised end and 4<em>hastas</em> at the other end. Vide diagram in the margin of page 269.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving, in relation to a given raised platform (part of) which has fallen down, at the number of bricks found (intact) in the unfallen (part) and also at the number of bricks found in the fallen (part) :-</p>
<p>52$\frac{1}{2}$. The difference between the top (breadth) and the bottom (breadth) is multiplied by the height of the fallen (portion) and divided by the whole height. (To the resulting quotient) the value of the top (breadth) is added. This gives rise to the measure of the basal breadth in relation to the upper (fallen portion) as well as to the top breadth inrelation to the lower (intact portion). The remaining operation has been already described.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>53$\frac{1}{2}$. (In relation to a raised platform), the length is 12 <em>hastas</em> the breadth at the bottom is 5 <em>hastas</em>, (the breadth) at the top is 1 <em>hasta</em>, and the height all through is 10 <em>hastas</em>. (A measure of) 5 <em>hastas</em> (in height) of that (platform) gets broken down and falls. How many are those (unit) bricks there (in the broken and the unbroken parts of the platform) ?</p>
<p>When a (high) fort-wall is broken down obliquely, the rule for arriving at the number of bricks which remain intact and of the bricks that have fallen down :-</p>
<p><strong>52</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. The measure of the top-breadth of the standing par of the platform - which is the same as the bottom-breadth of the fallen part of the platform - isalgebrically $\frac{(a~ - ~b)}{h}~ + ~b$; where <em>a</em> is the bottom-breadth, <em>b</em> is the top-breadth, <em>h</em> the total height and and<em>d</em>the height of the fallen part of the raised platform. This formulacan be easily shown to be correct by applying the properties of similar triangles.</p>
<p>The operation referred to in the rule as having been already described in what is given in stanza4 above.</p>
<p>54$\frac{1}{2}$. The bottom (breadth) and the top (breadth) are (each) doubled. To these are added (respectively) the top (breadth) and the bottom (breadth). The (resulting) quantities are (respectively) increased and decreased by the height (above the ground) of the unbroken (part of the wall); and (then the quantities so obtained) are multiplied by the length and also by the sixth part of the (total) height. (Thus) the number of bricks intact and the number of bricks fallen off may be obtained in order.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>55$\frac{1}{2}$. This high fort-wall (of measurements already given, struck by a cyclonic wind) has been (obliquely) from the bottom, broken down along the diagonal section. In relation thereto, how many are the bricks intact and the bricks fallen down ?</p>
<p>56$\frac{1}{2}$. The same high fort-wall has been broken down by the cycloneobliquely after leaving over 1 <em>hasta</em> from the bottom. How many are the bricks that remain intact and how many the bricks that have fallen down ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the growing number of layers (of bricks) in relation to the central height of afort-wall, and (also) for arriving at the (rate of the) diminution of layers(happening to be the diminution, in breadth) on both the sides (of the wall in passing from below upwards) :-</p>
<p><strong>54</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. If <em>a</em> be the breadth at the bottom, <em>b</em> the breadth at the top, <em>h</em> the total height and <em>l</em>the length of the wall, and <em>d</em> the height above the ground of the unbroken part of the wall then $\frac{lh}{6}~(2a~ + ~b~ + d)$, and $\frac{lh}{6}~(2b~ + ~a~ - ~d)$ represent the number of bricks intact and the number of bricks fallen off.</p>

<p>The figure in the margin shows the wall mentioned in stanza 56$\frac{1}{2}$; and ABCD indicate the plane along which the wall fractured when it broke.</p>
<p>57$\frac{1}{2}$. The height (of the central section) divided by the height of the given brick gives rise to the (required) measure of the layers (of bricks). This (number) is diminished by <em>one</em> and (then) divided by the difference between the top (breadth) and the bottom (breadth). The resulting quotient gives (in itself) the value of the (rate of the) diminution (in breadth) measured in terms of the layers.</p>
<p><em>Examples in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>58$\frac{1}{2}$. The breadth of a high fort wall is 7 <em>hastas</em> at the bottom Its height is 20 <em>hastas</em>. It is built so as to have 1 <em>hasta</em> (as its breadth) at the top. With the aid of bricks of 1 <em>hasta</em> in height, (find out) the (measure of the) growth of the (central) layers and of the (rate of) diminution (in the breadth).</p>
<p>59$\frac{1}{2}$-60. In a regularly circular well, 4 <em>hastas</em> in diameter, a wall of 1$\frac{1}{2}$<em>hastas</em> in thickness is built all round by means of (the already mentioned typical) bricks. The depth of that (well) is 3 <em>hastas</em>. If you know, calculate and tell me, O friend, how many are the bricks used in the building.</p>
<p>In relation to a structure built of bricks (around a place), the rule for arriving at the value of the cubical contents (of that structure), when the breadth at the bottom (of the structure) is given and also the breadth at the top:-</p>
<ol start="61">
<li>Twice the (average) thickness of the structure has added to it the given length and the breadth (of the place). The sum (so obtained) is doubled, and the result is the (total) length (of the structure when it is) in (the form of) an oblong. This (resulting quantity), multiplied by the (given) height and the (already mentioned average) thickness, gives rise to the (required) cubical measure).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>59</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$<strong>-60</strong>. The bricks contemplated here is the unit brick mentioned in stanza 43$\frac{1}{2}$above. This problem does not illustrate the rule given above in stanza 57$\frac{1}{2}$but it has to be worked according to the rules given in stanzas 19$\frac{1}{2}$-20$\frac{1}{2}$ and 44$\frac{1}{2}$of this chapter.</p>
<p><em>An example in ilustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="62">
<li>In relation to the (place known) as <em>vidyādhara-naghara</em>, the breadth is 8, and the length is 12. The thickness of the surrounding wall is 5 at the bottom and 1 at the top. Its height is 10. (What is the cubic measure of this wall ?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus ends (the section on) the measurement of (brick) piles in the operations relating to excavations.</p>
<p>Hereafter, we shall expound the operations relating to the work done with saws (in sawing wood). The definitions of terms in relation thereto are as follow :-</p>
<ol start="63">
<li>Two <em>hastas</em> less by six <em>aṅgulas</em> is what is called a <em>kiṣku</em>. The numbermeasuring the courses of cutting from the beginning to the end of a given(log of wood) has the name of <em>mārga</em> (orway).</li>
</ol>
<p>64-66. Then, in relation to collections (of logs) of wood of not less than two varieties, consisting of teak logs and other such logs hereafter to be mentioned, the number of <em>aṅgulas</em> measuring the breadth, and those measuring the length, and the number of <em>mārgas</em>are (all three) multiplied together. The resulting product is divided by the square of the number of <em>aṅgulas</em> found in a <em>hasta</em>. In operations relating to saw-work, this gives rise to a valuation (of the work as measured) in (what is known as) <em>paṭṭikās</em>. In relation to logs (of wood) consisting of teak logs and other such logs, the number of <em>hastas</em> measuring the breadth and of those measuring the length are multiplied with each other, and (then) multiplied by the number of <em>mārgas</em>, and (thereafter) divided by the <em>paṭṭikās</em>as above determined; this gives rise to the numerical measure of the work done by means of the saw.</p>
<p><strong>63 to 67</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. <em>Kiṣku</em>= 1$\frac{3}{4}$ <em>hasta</em>. <em>Mārga</em> is the name given to any desired course or line of sawing in a log of wood. The extent of the cut surface in a log of wood measures ordinarily the work done in sawing it provided that the wood is of a definite hardness assumed to be of unit value. This extent of the cut surface is measured by means of a special unit area which is called a<em>paṭṭikā</em> and is 96 <em>aṅgulas</em> in length and one <em>kiṣku</em> or 42 <em>aṅgulas</em> in breadth. It is easy to see that a <em>paṭṭikā</em> is thus equal to seven square <em>hastas</em>.</p>
<p>67-67$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to (logs of wood obtained from) trees named <em>śāka</em>, <em>arjuna</em>, <em>amla</em>-<em>vētasa</em>, <em>sarala</em>, <em>asita</em>, <em>sarja</em> and <em>ḍuṇḍuka</em>, and also (in relation to varieties of wood) named <em>śrīparṇī</em> and <em>plākṣa</em>, the <em>mārga</em> is 1in each case, the length is 96 <em>aṅgulas</em>, and the breadth is 1 <em>kiṣku</em> (for arriving at the measure of a <em>paṭṭikā</em>).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>68$\frac{1}{2}$. In relation to a log of teak wood, the length is 16 <em>hastas</em>, the breadth is 3$\frac{1}{2}$<em>hastas</em> and the <em>mārgas</em>(or saw-courses) are 8 in number. How many are (the units of saw-work) done here ?</p>
<p>Thus ends the section on saw-work in the (chapter on) operations relating to excavations.</p>
<p><strong>Thus ends the seventh subject of treatment known as Operations relating to Excavations in Sārasaṅgraha, which is a work on arithmetic by Mahāvīrācārya.</strong></p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>CALOULATIONS RELATING TO SHADOWS.</p>
<ol>
<li>That, Jina, Śānti, who bestows peace upon people, is the lord of the world, knows all beings, and is (ever) growing in influence through his eight miraculous powers - to him, who has vanquished the hosts of his enemies, I bow in salutation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the beginning, we shall give out the means of determining the eight directions commencing with the cast.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Onan even ground-surface which is (a horizontal plane) like the upper surface of water, a (perfectly) round circle should be drawn with the aid of a looped string having twice the length of an optionally chosen style (fixed in the centre).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shadow of that optionally chosen style fixed in the centre of that circle touches the (circumferential) line of that circle at the beginning of the day as also at the time forming the close of the day. By this, the western direction and the eastern direction are pointed out in order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By means of the string running in the line of these two(ascertained) directions, a fish-shaped figure (or lune) should bedrawn which will extend from north to south. The straight line running through the middle of the angles of this (fish-shaped figure) represents of itself the northern and the southern directions. The intermediate directions have to be ascertained as being derivable from half the (interspace between these) directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The string with theaid of which, the fish-shaped figure is drawn should be longer than the radius of the circle drawn according to stanza 2above. If OE and OWin the annexed diagram represent the eastern and the western directions, NPSR will be the lune drawn by describing two circles with centres respectively at E and W and with ER and WP as equal radii. The line NS cutting the angles of the lane marks the northern and the southern directions.</p>

<p>4$\frac{1}{2}$. The (measure of the) equinoctial shadow is indeed half of the sum of the measures of the shadows obtained at the middle of the day-time (or noon) on days when the sun enters the sign of Aries as also the sign of Libra.</p>
<p>5$\frac{1}{2}$. In Laṅkā, Yavakōṭi, Siddhapurī, and Rōmakāpurī, there is no (such) equinoctial shadow at all; and, therefore, the day-time is of 30 <em>ghāṭīs</em>.</p>
<p>6$\frac{1}{2}$. In other regions, the day-time happens to be longer or shorter by 30 <em>ghāṭīs</em>. On the days of the entrance (of the sun) into Aries and into Libra, the day-time is everywhere of 30 <em>ghāṭīs</em>(in duration).</p>
<p>7$\frac{1}{2}$. Having understood the measure of the duration of the day-time and also of the shadow at (noon or) the middle of the day according to the way described in astronomy, one should learn herein the calculations regarding shadows by means of the collection of rules hereafter to be given.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the time of day, on knowing the measure of the shadow of a given style at a given time (in the forenoon or afternoon) in relation to a place where there is no equinoctial shadow:-</p>
<p>8$\frac{1}{2}$. <em>One</em> is added to the measure of the shadow (expressed in terms of the height of an object), and (the sum so resulting)is doubled; with the (resulting) quantity the measure of the (whole) day-time is divided. It should be made out that this gives rise, according to the mathematical work (known as) Sārasaṅgraha, to the portion of the day elapsed in the forenoon and also to the portion of the day remaining in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. If<em>a</em> be the height of the object and<em>s</em> the length of its shadow, then the time of the day that has elapsed or has to elapse is, according to the rule given here, equal to $\frac{1}{2~\left( \frac{s}{a}~ + ~1 \right)},~i.e.,~\frac{1}{2\left( cot.A~ + ~1 \right)}$, where A is the angle representing the altitude of the sun at the time. It may be seen that this formula gives only the approximatevalue of the time of the day in all cases except when the altitude is 45^(∘), and that the approximation is very rough only in the case of large altitudes, nearing 90^(∘). The formula seems to be based on the fact that for small values the angles in a right-angled triangle are approximately proportional to the opposite sides.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>9$\frac{1}{2}$. The (length of the) shadow of a man is 3 times (his height). Say, dear friend, what portion of the day has gone in the forenoon, or what portion of the day remains in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (corresponding number of) <em>ghāṭīs</em>, when the portion of the day (elapsed or to elapse) has been arrived at (already).</p>
<p>10$\frac{1}{2}$. The (known) measure of (the duration of) the day multiplied by the numerator and divided by the denominator of the fraction representing the (already arrived at) portion of the day (elapsed or to elapse) gives rise to the <em>ghāṭīs</em>elapsed in relation to the forenoon, and to the <em>ghāṭīs</em>to elapse in relation to the afternoon.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>11$\frac{1}{2}$. In a region without the equinoctical shadow, $\frac{1}{8}$part of the day has elapsed; (or in relation to the afternoon), the remaining portion (of the day which has to elapse) is also $\frac{1}{8}$. What are the <em>ghāṭīs</em>(corresponding to this $\frac{1}{8}$ portion) ?There are, (it may be taken), 30 <em>ghāṭīs</em>in a day.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the time taken up by a prize-fight between gymnasts.</p>
<p>12$\frac{1}{2}$. The day diminished by the sum of the portion of the day elapsed and of the portion (thereof) remaining to elapse, when brought into the form of time (measured by <em>ghāṭīs</em>), gives rise to the (required duration of) time.</p>
<p>The measure of the shadow of a pillar divided by the measure of (the height of) the pillar gives rise to the measure of the shadow of a man (in terms of his own height).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>13$\frac{1}{2}$. A prize-fight between gymnasts began in the forenoon, when the shadow was equal in measure to the style. (Its) conclusion took place in the afternoon, when(the measure of the shadow was) twice (that of the style). What is the duration of the fight ?</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration (of the rule) in the latter half<br>
(of the stanza).</em></p>
<p>14$\frac{1}{2}$. The shadow of a pillar, 12 <em>hastas</em> (in height), is 24 <em>hastas</em> in measure. At that time, O arithmetician, of what measure will the human shadow be ?</p>
<p>The rule for arriving, at the period (of the day elapsed or to elapse), in places having the equinoctial shadow, when the measure of the shadow at any time is known :-</p>
<p>15$\frac{1}{2}$. To the measure of the known shadow (of the style) the measure of the style is added ; (this sum is) diminished by the measure of the equinoctial shadow, and (the resulting difference is) doubled. The measure of the style divided by the quantity (so arrived at) gives rise to the value of the portion of the day (elapsed) in the forenoon, or (to elapse) in the afternoon, (as the case may be).</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>16$\frac{1}{2}$-17. In the case of a style of 12 <em>aṅgulas</em>, the (equinoctial) noon-shadow is 2 <em>aṅgulas</em>, and the known shadow (at the time of observation) is 8 <em>aṅgulas</em>. What portion of the day is gone, or what portion (yet) remains ? If the portion of the day (elapsed or to elapse) happens to be $\frac{1}{3}$, what are the <em>ghāṭīs</em> (corresponding to it), the duration of the day being 30 <em>ghāṭīs</em> ?</p>
<p><strong>15</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically the formula given here for the measure of the time of theday is $\frac{a}{2~(s~ + ~a~ - ~e)}$where <em>e</em> is the length of the equinoctial shadow of the style. The formula is obviously based on the formula given in the note to the rule in stanza $8\frac{1}{2}$ above.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the measure of the shadow corresponding to a time (of day) given in <em>ghāṭīs</em>.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>The measure of the style is divided by twice the measure of the (given) portion of the day;(from the resulting quotient) the measure of the style is subtracted, and (to it) the (equinoctial) noon-shadow is added. This gives rise to the measure of the shadow at the required time of day.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="19">
<li>If, in the case of a style of 12 <em>aṅgulas</em>, the (equinoctial) shadow is 2 <em>aṅgulas</em>, what is the measure of the shodow (of the style) at a time when 10 <em>ghāṭīs h</em>ave elapsed or have to elapse, the duration of the day-time being 30 <em>ghāṭīs</em> ?</li>

<p>The definition of the measure of a man&rsquo;s foot in relation to measurements carried out by means of the foot-measure as involved in the shadow.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>One seventh of the height of a person happens to be the length of that person&rsquo;s foot. If this be so, that person shall be fortunate. (Thus) the measure of the shadow in terms of the foot-measure is obvious.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical measure of the shadow which has ascended up (a perpendicular wall).</p>
<p><strong>18</strong>. Algebraically, $s~ = ~\frac{a}{2y}~ - ~a~ + ~e$, where <em>g</em>is the measure of the time of the day in <em>ghāṭīs</em>. This formula may be seen to follow from that given in the note to stanza 15$\frac{1}{2}$above.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>(The height of) the style is multiplied by the measure of the human shadow (in terms of the man&rsquo;s height).

Thequotient so obtained happens to be the measure of (that portion of) the style&rsquo;s shadow which is on the wall.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="22">
<li>A pillar is 20 <em>hastas</em> (in height); the interval between (this) pillar and the wall (on which its shadow falls) is 8 <em>hastas</em>. The human shadow (at the time) is twice (the man&rsquo;s height). What is the measure of (that portion of) the pillar-shadow which is on the wall ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical value of the measurement of the interspace between a wall and a pillar, when the height of the pillar and the numerical value of (that portion of) the shadow thereof which has fallen upon the wall are (both) known.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>28 and 30</strong>. The rules here given are based on the rule stated in the latter half of the stanza 12$\frac{1}{2}$ above.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="29">
<li>The combined sum of the(height) measure of the style, and the (length) measure of its shadow is 50. What may be the height of the style, the human-shadow being (at the time) 4 times (the human height)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Therule for separating the (length) measure of the shadow of the style and the measure of the human shadow (in terms of the human height) from (their) combined sum :-</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>The combined sum of the measures of the shadows of a style and of a man is divided by the (known height) measure of the style as increased by <em>one</em>. The quotient (so obtained) is the measure of the human shadow (in terms of the human height). The combined sum (above-mentioned) as diminished by this (measure of the human shadow) gives rise to (the length-measure of) the shadow of the style.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="31">
<li>The height of a styleis 10. The sum of the human shadow (in terms of the human height) and (the length of) the shadow of the style is 55. How much is the measure of the human shadow (in terms of the human height and how much is the length of the shadow of the style) ?</li>
</ol>
<p>The rulefor arriving at the measure of the inclination of a pillar (or vertical style):-</p>
<p>32-33. The product of the square of the human shadow and the square (of the height) of the style is to be subtracted from the square of the (given) shadow. This (remainder) is to be multiplied by the sum of the square of the human shadow and <em>one</em>. (The quantity so arrived at) is to be subtracted from the square of the (given) shadow. The square root of this (resulting remainder) is to be subtracted from the (given) measure of the shadow; and, when (the quantity thus obtained is) divided by (the sum of) <em>one</em> and the square of the human shadow, there results exactly the measure of the inclination of the pillar.</p>
<p><strong>32-33</strong>. Let AB represent the position of a slanting pillar, and AC its shadow; and let AD be the same pillar in the vertical position and AE its shadow. Then $\frac{AE}{AD}$is equal to the ratio of the shadow of a man to his height at the time, and let this ratio be <em>r</em>. BG, the perpendicular from B on AD, represents the amount of slanting of the pillar, AB. It can be easily shown that$\frac{\sqrt{AB^{2}~ - ~BG^{2}}}{AC~ - ~BG}~ = ~\frac{AD}{A}~ = ~\frac{l}{r}$ From this it can be seen that$BG~ = \frac{AC~ - ~\sqrt{AC^{2}~ - ~\left( AC^{2}~ - ~AB^{2}~ \times ~r^{2} \right)~\left( r^{2}~ + ~1 \right)}}{r^{2}~ + ~1}$ . The rule here gives thissame formula.</p>

<p><em>(General Examples).</em></p>
<p>35-37$\frac{1}{2}$. A certain prince, staying in the interior of a palace, was, (at a certain moment) in the course of a forenoon, desirous of knowing the time elapsed in the course of the day, as also the measure of the human shadow (in terms of the human height). Then, the light of the sun coming through a window at a height of 32 <em>hastas</em> in the middle of the eastern wall fell at a place on the western wall at the height of 29 <em>hastas</em>. The distance between those two walls is 24 <em>hastas</em>. O mathematician, if you have taken pains (to acquaint yourself) with shadow-problems, calculate and give out the measure of the time elapsed then, on that day, and also the measure of the human shadow (at that time in terms of the human height).</p>
<p>38$\frac{1}{2}$-39$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:258"><a href="#fn:258" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">258</a></sup>. At the time when, in the course of a forenoon, the human shadow is twice the humanheight, what, in relation to a (vertical excavation of) square (section) measuring 10 <em>hastas</em> in each dimension, will be the height of the shadow on the western wall caused by the eastern wall (thereof) ? O mathematician, give out, if you know, how yon may arrive at the value of the shadow that has ascended up (a perpendicular wall).</p>
<p><strong>35-37</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. This example bears on the rules given in stanzas 8$\frac{1}{2}$ and 23 above.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the shadow of a style due to (the light of) a lamp :-</p>
<p>40$\frac{1}{2}$. The height of the lamp as diminished by the height of the style is divided by the height of the style. If, by means of the quotient so obtained, the (horizontal) distance between the lamp and the style is divided, the measure of the shadow of the style ia arrived at.</p>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>41$\frac{1}{2}$-42. The (horizontal) distance between a styleand a lamp is in fact 96<em>aṅgulas</em>. The height of the flame of the lamp (abovethe floor) is 60 (<em>aṅgulas</em>). O you who have gone to the othershore of the ocean of calculation, tell me quickly the measure of the shadow due to the flame of the lamp, in relation, to a style which is 12 <em>aṅgulas</em> (in height).</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the (horizontal) distance between the lamp and the style :-</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>The height of the lamp (above the floor) is diminished by the height of the style. The (resulting) quantity is divided by the height of the style. The measure of the shadow of the style, on being multiplied by the quotient so obtained, gives rise to the (horizontal) measure of the intervening distance between the style and the lamp.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>44<sup id="fnref:259"><a href="#fn:259" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">259</a></sup>. The shadow of the style is 8 <em>aṅgulas</em> (in length). The height of the flame of the lamp (above the floor) is 60 (<em>aṅgulas</em>).</p>
<p><strong>40</strong>$\frac{1}{2}$. Algebraically stated the rule is $s~ = ~c~ \div ~\frac{b~ - ~a}{a}$;where<em>s</em> is the length of the shadow of the stylewhose height is represented by <em>a, b</em> is the height of the lamp above the ground, and <em>c</em>the horizontal distance between the Iamp and the style. The formula may beseen to be correct by means of the diagram here given.</p>

<p>O you who have gone to the other shore of the ocean of calculation, say what (the measure of) the intervening horizontal distance is between the style and the lamp.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical measure of the height of the lamp (above the floor) :-</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>The measure of the (horizontal) distance between the lamp and the style is divided by the shadow of the style. (Then) <em>one</em> is added (to the resulting quotient). The quantity so obtained, on being multiplied by the measure of the height of the style, gives rise to the measure of the height of the lamp (above the floor).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<p>40-47. The (length of the) shadow of the style is exactly twice(its height). The measure of the intervening (horizontal) distance between the style and the lamp is 200 <em>aṅgulas</em>. What is the measure of the height of the lamp (above the floor) in this case? Here and also in the foregoing example, the measure of the height of the style has to be understood as consisting of 12 <em>aṅgulas</em>, and then the way in which the meaning of the rule works out is to be learnt well.</p>
<p>The rule for arriving at the numerical measure of the height of a tree, when the measure (of the length) of the shadow of a man in terms of (his) foot and the measure of the length of the shadow of the tree in terms of the measure of that same foot are known; as also for arriving at the numerical measure (of the length) of the shadow of the tree in terms of that same foot-measure, when the numerical measure of the height of the tree and the numerical measure (of the length) of the shadow of a man in terms of (his) foot are known :-</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>
<p>Similarly, $b~ = ~\left( \frac{c}{s}~ + ~1 \right)~a$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The measure (of the length) of the shadow of the tree chosen by a person is divided by (the foot-measure of the length of) his own shadow, and then it is multiplied by <em>seven</em> : this gives rise to the height of the tree. This (height of the tree) divided by <em>seven</em> and multiplied by the foot-measure of his shadow surely gives rise to the measure (of the length) of the shadow of the tree exactly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An example in illustration thereof.</em></p>
<ol start="49">
<li>The foot-measure (of the length) of one&rsquo;s own shadow is 4. The (length of the) shadow of a tree is 100 in terms of the(same) foot-measure. Say what the height of that tree is in terms of themeasure of one&rsquo;s own foot.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>An eanmple for arriving at the numerical measure of the shadow<br>
of a tree.</em></p>
<ol start="50">
<li>The measure (of the length) of one&rsquo;s own shadow (at the time) is 4 times the measure of (one&rsquo;s own) foot. The height of a tree is 175 (in terms of such a foot-measure). What is the measure of the shadow of the tree then ?</li>
</ol>
<p>51-52$\frac{1}{2}$<sup id="fnref:260"><a href="#fn:260" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">260</a></sup>. After going over (a distance of) 8 <em>yōjanas</em> (to the cast) of city, there is a hill of 10 <em>yōjanas</em> in height. In the city also there is a hill of 10 <em>yōjanas</em> in height. After going over (a distance of) 80 <em>yōjanas</em> (from the) eastern hill to the west, there is another hill. Lights on the top of this (last mentioned hill) are seen at nights by the inhabitants of the city. The shadow of the hill lying at the centre of the city touches the base of the easternhill. Give out quickly, O mathematician, what the height of this (western) hill is.</p>
<p><strong>Thus ends the eighth subject of treatment, known as Calculations relating to shadows, in Sārasaṅgraha, which is a work on arithmetic by Mahāvīrācārya.</strong></p>
<p>SO ENDS THIS SĀRASAṄGRAHA.</p>
