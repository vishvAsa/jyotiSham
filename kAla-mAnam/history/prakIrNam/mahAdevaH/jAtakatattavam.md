**INTRODUCTION**  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have great pleasure in being able to present before the public one more monumental work-Jataka Tatva **जातकतत्व ;** -- Which I think will prove a useful addition to the student of Astrology. That Astrology is a boat necessary to save mankind from the dangers which come unnoticed, cannot be denied. Vaidyanatha Dikshita rightly observes in his Jatakaparijata as follows :

**अर्थार्जने सहायः पुरुषाणामापदर्णवे पोतः ।**

**यात्राकाले मन्त्रि जातकमपहाय नास्त्यपरः ॥**

“There is nothing in the world like a horoscope to help men in the acquisition of wealth, to save them like a boat in a sea of troubles and to serve them as a guide in their journeys.” This school of thought was kept in vogue in ancient Hindu system of education, wherein a. Brahmin, before entering the portals of married life, should necessarily undergo tuition in the four Vedas and the Shad Angas (six Angas) viz.,

**शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं ज्योतिषां गतिः ।**

**छन्दसां लक्षणं चैव षडङ्गो वेद उच्यते ॥**

“Phonetics, work dealing with Rituals, Grammar, Etymology, Astronomy and Astrology and Prosody.” It was thought that the student's career would not be complete without a good knowledge of **ज्योतिष**(Jyotisha). It is a pity that the modern leading Universities of the World are not paying the attention which this celestial Science deserves. Any time spent on it is not a waste, but an acquisition.No doubt importance should be given to the correct method of teaching, and if this be faithfully followed, I have no doubt one of our long-cherished hopes will be fulfilled.

              The present work is significantly different from other works, in as much as the method of imparting is by Sutras and not by Slokas. The author has very cleverly classified results under different heads making reference easy. Much importance is given to the connection between Medicine and Astrology which only goes to show how a knowledge of Astrology will go a long way to increase the Doctor's merit. This has been rightly observed by Rao Bahadur Dr. M. Gurusami Mudaliar of Madras in his Presidential address to the Scientific Session of the Tenth L. I. M. Conference held at Madras last December wherein he says: "A knowledge of Astrology if judicially applied, has not merely a theoretical value; it has also a practical value. The horoscope of any individual may be noted in his Case Sheet."

       Mahadeva, the author of this work, seems to be a man of exceptional merit. His knowledge of Medicine and his fluency of Sanskrit are all well brought out in the work. He seems to be a devotee of Goddess Parvati, more in the **प्रवृत्तिमार्ग**-Pravrithi marga than in the **निवृत्ति** -Nivrithi one .The first Sutra in the **संज्ञातत्त्व**
-Samjn Tatva and the introductory Sloka in the **प्रकीर्णतत्त्व**
-Prakeerna Tatva speak in support of this statement. He has freely adopted ideas from Varahamihira, Kalyana-Varinan, Vaidyanatha Dikshita and others, but with the difference that he has inade use of his own free views wherever necessary. This goes to show that the date of Mahadeva should be a later one than that of Vaidyanatha Dikshita.  


The work consists of five Tatvas. ; viz , (1) **संज्ञातत्त्व -**Samjna Tatva (2) **सूतिकातत्त्व**- Sutika Tatva (3) **प्रकीर्णतत्त्व**- Prakirna Tatva (4) **स्त्रीजातकतत्त्व**- Stri Jataka Tatva, and (5)
**दशातत्त्व**- Dasa Tatva. The word **तत्त्व**-Tatva, itself gives us a suggestion that the five elements which compose the human body respectively correspond to the five above Tatva. **पृथ्वीतत्त्व**- Prithwi Tatva is the foundation of our body and **संज्ञातत्त्व**-Samjna Tatva is therefore enunciated first. This is followed by **सूतिकातत्त्व**-Sutika Tatva as'water' follows Earth (**पृथ्वी**- Prithwi ) .**प्रकीर्णतत्त्व**- Prakirna Tatva is the biggest and the most beautiful of the work; and if this is removed, the work suffers extinction, just as our body suffers extinction, if **तेजस्**-Tejas is removed. **स्त्रीजातकतत्व**-Stri Jataka Tatva is comparable with
**वायु** -Vayu as the planet presiding over this **तत्त्व**-Tatva is Venus -a female planet-- vide **उत्तरकालामृत**IV-25 . Further,the direction for which **वायु**-Vayu is the lord is owned by the Moon
--another female planet. (Vide **बृ.जा**II-5). The **दशातत्त्व** -Dasa Tatva is the finale of the book and corresponds to Ether, the last of the **पञ्चतत्त्व**-Pancha Tatva. A clear interpretation of a **दशा**-Dasa is a difficult task and in rarity is capable of being compared with the rare element Ether and is as far from the human reach as the conservative planet Saturn is from the Earth.

                   I beg to acknowledge with deep gratitude the valuable help rendered to me cheerfully by His Holiness Sri:Vaidyanatha Bharathi Swami D.D , D.V.S. , President of the Mysore Ayurvedic Academy, in suggesting correct technical English medical terms for the several kinds of diseases referred to in this book.

        Opportunity has been freely taken to show the esoteric side of Astrology. Helping incidents from the IndianMythology have been stated more than once in their proper places. An appendix containing two charts has been added wherein importance of lunar constellations and their influence on life are widely discussed.  


     I have to state here that almost all the notes in this work have been written by my son, Chi: K. S. Krishnamurti, B. Sc. (Hons). I must offer my thanks to Mr. V. B. Srikantaiya of Messrs. V. B. Soobbiah & Sons, for the neat and expeditious execution of the work.

The Dwadasamsas or 1/12th portions of a sign are to be reckoned from that sign.

The arrangementof Shodasamsas mentioned here are interesting in as much as they keep up the nature of the Rasis which contain them (the Shodasamsas). That is, for Mesha, the Shodasamsas begin with Mesha and end with Kataka. Thus Mesha, a चर(Chara sign, has a चर(Chara) Shodasamsa for its beginning as well as for its end. Similarly, स्थिर(Stthira) and उभय(Ubhaya) signs have a respective beginning and end.

The 12th places from these two houses are known as मारक(Maraka-determining Death) houses. It is interesting to note the link which these two houses bear with the life of a native. The 2nd house represents the two factors, कुटुम्ब (Kutumba-family) and अर्थ (Arttha -Wealth), The 7th in its turn represents the necessary factor for the 2nd, i.e., the wife. It is these two factors that appear the most welcome ones for a native, and it is they that destroy him in the end; and it is but right that these two houses should therefore be termed मारक (Maraka) houses. Thus, the genesis of philosophy in its best is presented before the reader, and it is up to himto view this point with a correct phase-angle.

**cf . शङ्कराचार्य - मोहमुद्गर.**

**३०. स्वान्त्यौ नेत्रसंज्ञौ । **

The 2nd and 12th houses are known as the two eyes.

**५७. अन्योन्यस्य पार्श्वत्रयगास्तत्काले मित्राणि शेषाः शत्रवः ।**

Planets that occupy the next three contiguous houses on either side with respect to any planet are considered to be his friends forthe time-being. The rest are his enemies.

**५८. उभयथा मित्राण्यधिमित्राणि शत्रवस्त्वधिशत्रवो मित्रशत्रवः समा मित्रसमा मित्राणि शत्रुसमाः शत्रवः ।**

If there is friendliness both naturally and temporarily on the part of a planet, he is a great friend. Those that are enemies both ways are deadly foes invariably. That planet is but a friend who has the character of being neutral and friendly from the two points of view, while the one which has the character of being inimical and neutral is an enemy. A planet that is inimical in the one case and friendly in the other is to be taken as neutral.

**५९. तृतीयदशमौ नवमपञ्चमौ चतुर्थाष्टमौ सप्तमं पादर्द्धितो ग्रहाः पश्यन्ति।**

All the planets cast a quarter glance at the 3rd and 10th houses; half a glance at the 5th and 9th; three quarters of a glance at the 4th and 8th; and a full eye at the 7th.

Saturn is exceedingly powerful when he casts his glance at the 3rd and 10th. Jupiter is auspicious in his glances at the 5th and 9th. Mars is potent with his glance at the 4th and 8th.

**६१. दिने वारारम्भादस्तकालो निश्यस्ततो वारप्रवेशकालान्तःस्ववारखण्डेन हतोऽष्टभक्तो लब्धं गुलिकेष्टकालः।**

From Sunrise to Sunset it is day. It is night afterwards and lasts till the entry of the next weekday. The entire interval of day or night as the case may be when multiplied by the weekday's खण्ड(Khanda -- Vide 63 infra -- and divided by 8 will reveal Gulika's position at the time.

**६२. तत्काललग्नतुल्यो गुलिकः।**

The position of Gulika will correspond to the Lagna at the time.

**६३. दिने अर्काद्राज्ञौ ज्ञान्नगाङ्गपञ्चाब्धित्रिनेत्रेन्दुमिता गुलिकखण्डाः।**

In day time, if a day be divided into 8 equal parts, Gulika's period will be the 7th part on a Sunday, the 6th on a Monday, 5th on a Tuesday, 4th on a Wednesday, 3rd on a Thursday, 2nd on a Friday and the 1st on a Saturday. During night time, the counting has to be made from Mercury instead of from the Sun ; that is, when a night is divided into 8 equal parts, Gulika's portion will be the 7th on a Wednesday night, 6th on a Thursday night, 5th on a Friday night, 4th on a Saturday night, 3rd on a Sunday night, 2nd on a Monday night and 1st on a Tuesday night.

Let us find out the position of Gulika for the sample horoscope taken for illustration in my edition of श्रीपतिपद्धति-Sripati Paddhati p. 3 (1937).  
   The time of birth was on Friday night (30th April 1853 at 30° vighatikas before Sunrise).  
The length of the night on that day is given to be 29 . व.5 वि. Dividing this by 8 as per 61 above, we get the duration of each खण्ड(Khanda) of the night to be 3 घ. 38. 125 वि. According to the rule enunciated above, Gulika's position on that night is the 5th खण्ड(Khanda) or the lagna revealed at 5 x (3 घ.-38.125 वि.) or 18 घ.10'625 वि. after Sunset as per rule 62, that is, 10 signs 2° 47' 54".

**६४. अन्योन्यदृष्टौ एकतरदृष्टौ अन्योन्यस्थानस्थितावेकत्र स्थितौ वा सम्बन्धोऽवगन्तव्यः ।**

Two planets are said to have संबन्ध (Sambandha) or relationship when they (1) mutually aspect each other (2) when only one of them is aspecting the other ; (3) when ench of them occupies the other's house (4) when both of them occupy a single house.

**६५. मन्दार्काराःशुष्काश्चन्द्राच्छौ सजलौ जलर्क्षगौज्ञेज्यौ च ।**

Saturn, the Sun and Mars are termed dry or waterless planets. The Moon and Venus are called watery planets. Mercury and Jupiter are water-resorters.

**६६. सर्वग्रहेभ्योऽधिकांशादिनाऽऽत्मकारकस्ततः क्रमेण न्यूनांशा अमात्यभ्रातृमातृपितृपुत्रज्ञातिदारकारकाः।**

Whichever among the planets has advanced the greatest number of degrees in the Rasi occupied by him is known as the आत्मकारक (Atmakaraka). The planet that is next in degree to the आत्मकारक (Atmakaraka) is called अमात्यकारक (Amatyakaraka) and the next as भ्रातृकारक (Bhratrukaraka); next as मातृ पितृकारक (Matru, Pitrukaraka); and the next as पुत्रकारक (Putrakaraka); the next as ज्ञातिकारक (Jnatikaraka) and the next as दारकारक (Darakaraka).

**६७. अंशशब्देनात्मकारकनवांशः।**

When the word अंश(Amsa) is used in this work independently without reference to any particular planet, it should be construed as denoting the Navamsa occupied by the आत्मकारक (Atmakaraka) planet.

**६८. ओजर्क्षेक्रमाद्बालकुमारयुववृद्धमृताख्या अवस्थाः समर्क्षेव्यत्ययः।**

In an odd sign, according to the number of degrees advanced, a planet is said to be in infancy, in boyhood, in adolescence, in advanced age and in extremis. But in an even sign, these several divisions have to be again made regularly in the reverse order.

**६९. द्वादशांशादंशषट्केऽवस्थितः पूर्णफलदः ।**

A planet is said to be productive of full effect if he is posited in the six-degree portion after 12 degrees in a Rasi, i.e., when he is posited between 13° and 18° both inclusive.

**७०. बलं पद्धत्युक्तम् ।**

The method to calculate the strength of planets has been given in detail in पद्धति(Paddhati).

**७४. ग्रहर्क्षसंख्या ग्रहसंख्याहता पुनः ग्रहांशसंख्याहता इष्टजन्मनक्षत्रलग्नसंख्याभिर्युतार्कनष्टा शेषावस्था ।**

To find the particular अवस्था(Avastha) a planet is undergoing at the time, the method to be adopted is as stated overleaf :  
(1) Find the number of the Nakshatra (reckoned from Aswini) in which the planet is situated.

(2) Find the number of the planet counted from the Sun.

(3) Find the number of the actual degree which the planet is occupying at the time under consideration.

  Find the product of the numbers represented by (1), (2) & (3).  
 To this must be added--

(a) the number indicating the order of the person's जन्मनक्षत्र(Janmanakshatra)

(b) the number representing the order of the- जन्मलग्न-Janmalagna (counted from Mesha)

(c) the numberrepresenting the ghatika since previous Sunrise at which the birth has taken place.

       Divide the result by 12. The remainder will indicate the order of the अवस्था- Avasttha (counted फ्रों शयन - Sayana) of the planet.  
For an illustration, see जा . पा . pp. 93-94.

**७५. शयनोपवेशननेत्रपाणिप्रकाशगमनागमनसभागमभोजननृत्यलिप्साकौतुकनिद्रा अवस्थाः।**

The following are the 12 अवस्थाः(Avastthas): -

-Agamana (not going), (7) सभा -Sabha (assembly), (8) आगम -Agama (coming), (9) भोजन - Bhojana (eating)



(10) नृत्यलिप्सा- Nrityalipsa (desire to dance), (11) कौतुक-Kautuka (delight, joy, pleasure) and (12) निद्रा-Nidra (sleep).

**७६. खोच्चगो दीप्तः स्वभगः स्वस्थो हितभगो हास्ययुक्तः शुभवर्गगः शान्तः स्फुरद्रश्मिः शक्तो मूढो लुप्तो नीचगो दीनः पापशत्रुभगः पीडितः।**



**॥ इति महादेवकृतजातकतत्वे संज्ञातत्वं प्रथमम् ॥**

    A planet is said to be in दीप्तावस्था -Deeptavasttha (blazing) when he is in his exaltation. He is स्वस्थ- Swasttha or confident when he is in his own house. He is happy when in a friend's house. He is in a शान्त- Santa (calm) state when he has reached the varga of a benefic planet. He is ( in the शक्त -Sakta state) capable when he shines bright with unclouded splendour. He is failing (लुप्त-Lupta) when he has set or disappeared. He is exceedingly afraid (दीन -Deena) when he occupies his depression. He is tortured when in an Amsa of an enemy.

**Thus ends the first chapter styled "Samjna Tatva" in the work Jataka Tatva composed by Sri:Mahadeva.**

**B. II. सूतिकातत्वम् - Sutika Tatva.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**१. चन्द्रेणादृष्टेऽङ्गे पितुः परोक्षे जन्म ।**

When the Lagna is not aspected by the Moon, the birth is out of the father's sight.

**२. स्थिरेऽर्केऽष्टमाङ्कायान्त्ये चन्द्रेण चादृष्टेऽङ्गे
स्वदेशस्थपितुः परोक्षं जन्म।**

If, when the Sun occupying a fixed sign identical with the 8th, 9th, 11th or 12th, the Lagna be not aspected by the Moon, the father will be in his own native place; but the birth will be out of his sight.

**३. चरेऽर्के तु प्राग्वज्जातस्य पितरि विदेशं गते जन्म ।**

If, in the previous case, the Sun occupy a moveable sign, the birth will happen when the father is absent in a foreign country.

**४. मन्देऽङ्गे वाऽस्ते भौमे पितुः परोक्षं जन्म ।**

When Saturn is rising or Mars is setting (occupies the 7th), the father will be away at the time of the birth of the child.

If proper attention is given, there is much sense in this statement. Saturn and Mars always inherit a teasing tendency and the author gives bere importance to the signs aspected by them. Saturn in the Lagna is identical with his aspect over the 2nd and the 7th from the 9th which are the कुटुम्ब(Kutumba) and कलत्र(Kalatra) places from the 9th. That is why he inflicts a separation between the father and the mother, and hence the birth in the absence of the former. Similar argument holds good for Mars in the 7th because of his cruel aspect over the 2nd ( or कुटुम्ब-Kutumba) house counted from the 9th.

Saturn's cruelty in the above will be more forcible when the rising sign is a moveable one. cf. बृ.जा. V-2, (p. 93).

**५ . ज्ञाच्छान्तरे चन्द्रे अपि।**

The same effect, even if the Moon is betwixt Mercury and Venus.

Considering the two different conditions enunciated in Sutras 2, 3 and 4, we come to the following conclusions : The Sun is given predominance in 2 and 3 above, while Saturn is given importance in the 4th. The Sun is the पितृकरक (Pitrukaraka) for day-births while Saturn plays that role for night-births. Hence 2 & 3 probably refer to day-births, and 4 and 5 for night-ones. Cf. सारावली

**द्युनिशोरर्कासितयोः कुजेन संदृष्टयोः पितुरभावः ।  
चरमशौ परदेशे युक्तेक्षितयोस्तु तत्र भृतः ॥**

If the rising sign be a human Rasi and Saturn occupying it be aspected by Mars, the delivery will be in a cemetery or a burning place. If Venus and the Moon aspect Saturn in the position described, the place of delivery will be a lovely one. If Jupiter be the aspecting planet, delivery will take place in the house dedicated to the sacred fire (or kitchen?). If the Sun should aspect, the place of delivery will be a palace, a temple or a cowhouse. And lastly an art gallery (or a big building) will be the place of delivery when Mercury is the aspecting planet.

If the Moon and Mercury occupy Kendra positions and be aspected by a powerless Saturn or Mars, the child will die in the course of the year.

The word मूढgenerally means “overpowered by solar rays." If the Sutra were to be construed in this sense, then the interpretation will be as follows: "The Moon and Mercury occupy Kendra positions with reference to the Lagna. They must be aspected by an eclipsed Saturn or Mars or by both. This involves that Sun-Conj-Saturn or Sun-Conj-Mars is in opposition to Mercury or square to Mercury. This is an impossibility as the greatest elongation of the inferior planet from the Sun is only 28º." Hence मूढ is interpreted here as 'powerless'.

**८९. लग्नपाच्चन्द्रेंशेऽष्टमे पापमात्रदृष्टे वर्षद्वयायुः।**

Any of the following three combinations, viz., (a) the Moon, the Sun and Jupiter, (b) the Moon, the Sun, Saturn and Mars, or (c) Saturn, the Moon, Venus and Mars, will cause the death of the child in the 5th year.

**९५. लग्ने राहौपापमात्रदृष्टयुते पञ्चमाब्दे मृतिः।**

If Rahu occupy the Lagna and be aspected by or conjoined with only malefics, the child born will die in the 5th year.

If Venus be in the 6th, 8th or 12th identical with a sign owned by the Sun or the Moon and be also aspected by a malefic, the child will die in the 6th year.

If the Sun, Saturn and Mars occupy the Lagna, and the waning Moon be in the 7th, the death of the child will happen in the 6th or 7th year.

   The Sutra under reference presents a highly conflicting idea. The author wants the Sun, Saturn and Mars-all the three male. fics---in the Ascendant, while the Moon should be waning as well as in the 7th. Having given the 7th place from the Sun, it is really a problem to conceive of a waning Moon. The only way to get out of this clutch is to apply this Sutra for births at Lat. 80° and above, where it is possible to have 6.Bhavas within 36° say, and the remaining 6 spread over 324°, Only in such cases, the position of the waning Moon in the 7th Bhava is possible. I think this Sutra finds a very rare application.

**९८. क्षीणेन्दावस्ते लग्ने मन्दाराच्छा गुर्वदृष्टाः सप्तमेऽब्दे
मृतिः।**

If the waning Moon be in the 7th and the three planets, Saturn, Mars and Venus occupy the Lagna and be not aspected by Jupiter, the death of the child concerned will be in the 7th year.

If Venus were to be in the Lagna and the waning Moon in the 7th, then this Sutra will have to find its application only in latitudes 60° and above, as the greatest elongation of Venus is 45° from the Sun. The 7th should be interpreted as 7th Bhava.

**९९. षष्ठाष्टमगाः सौम्याः कोणे पापा अष्टमेऽब्दे मृतिः।**

When benefics occupy the 6th and 8th, and malefics be posited in the 5th and 9th, the child concerned will take its departure in the 8th year.

If the rising Navamsa be owned by Mithuna, the body of the native will be fully developed.

    It will be evident that out of 108 Navamsas in the zodiac, only 9 are owned by Mithuna. They are (1) Aswini 3, (2) Rohini 3, (3) Punarvasu 3, (4) Magha 3, (5) Hasta 3, (6) Visakha 3, (7) Moola 3, (8) Sravana 3 and (9) Purvabhadra 3. A clear analysis of these nine padas (पाद) will show that these are associated in one way or another with Jupiter. The sense of Sutra 25 above may be taken here. For want of space, the explanation is not given in detail. Two or three examples are given here by way of enlightenment to the reader:

Aswini 3 finds its place at Punarvasu 1 in Mithuna, which is a star ruled by Jupiter and hence establishes its connection with Jupiter.

Rohini 3 replaces Punarvasu 2 which for the same reason above cited establishes its relation with Jupiter.

Magha 3 finds place at Visakha 1 during its transit, which is again Jupiter's star.

Hence by virtue of its association with Jupiter, any Mithuna Navamsa (मिथुननवांश) gives देहपुष्टि- Dehapushti. In addition, it has to be stated that Mithuna is the only complete human Rasi, and it is but right that a well-developed body is associated with it.

Mercury - a planet meant for jocular temperament and allied talents – is placed in the 6th, a house associated with the 6 enemies of man (अरिषड्वर्ग- Arishadvarga).

पापौ would have been a better reading than पापाः, as the malefics that are meant in this Sutra are only Mars and Saturn. The malefics are the Sun, Mars, Saturn, the two nodes, Mercury and the waning Moon. The question of waning Moon does not arise as the time refers to a lunar eclipse and hence a full Moon.When full Moon is rising, naturally the birth will be in the evening twilight which is असुरसन्ध्याया -Asura Sandhya.

Solar and lunar eclipses occur in Amavasya (New Moon) and Pournima (full Moon) days respectively, the Sun being in conjunction with either of the nodes. This Sutra deals with a case of a solar eclipse caused by the Sun being conjoined with Rahu, the ascending node. The attention of the reader should be focused on the necessity of thepresence of Rabu in the Lagna. Let us examine the nature of relationship existing between these two significators--the Sun and Rahu.With reference to Simha, tbe Moolatrikona of the Sun, Rahu has his constellations स्वाती(Swati), शतभिषा(Satabhisha) and आर्द्रा(Ardra) in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses-which are all unfavourable for frien आर्द्रा (बृ.जा. II-15). Further, Rahu is the embodiment of darkness (शनिवद्राहुः), and he being in par with Saturn is the worst enemy of the Sun. The descending nodeclaims equality with Mars (कुजवत्केतुः) and stands for fire. The stars ruled by Ketu are मघा(Magha), मूला(Moola) and
अश्विनी(Aswini). They are posited in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses reckoned from Simha which are all friendly houses. Hence a solar eclipse caused by the association of the ascending node is more malefic in nature than that by Ketu. And it is but right that Darkness (Rahu) should be a factor to cause blindness. In this connection, the attention of the reader is drawn to the fact that among the Hindus, more
शान्ति(Shanti) is ordained to be performed at the time of a solar eclipse occurring in a person's natal star when the eclipse is caused by Rahu than when it is by Ketu.

**२४४. नेत्राङ्गेशौ भान्वच्छयुतौ त्रिके जन्मान्धः ।**

If the lords of the 2nd and 1st houses be conjoined with the Sun and Venus and occupy the 6th, 8th or 12th, the person concerned will be blind from his very birth.

**२४८. ज्ञेन्दूत्रिके शास्त्रान्धः।**

If Mercury and the Moon be in the 6th, 8th and 12th, the person concerned will have no faith in Sastras.

**२४९. इन्द्वर्कौसोत्थे वा केन्द्रेऽन्धः।**

**२५०. पापर्क्षेभौमे केन्द्रेऽन्धः।**

**२५१. यमर्क्षेऽस्ते सूर्येऽन्धः।**

If the Sun occupy a sign owned by Saturn and identical with the 7th, the person concerned will become  
blind.

      The Sun who is the embodiment of learning (as he is generally known as a नवव्याकरणदण्डित ), is placed in Saturn's Rasi, and that too in the 7th, to cause blindness. This means that the birth is in the signs owned by the two luminaries who are the two eyes of the All Omnipotent. cf. Bhagavat Gita XI-19.

**अनादिमध्यान्तमनन्तवीर्यमनन्तबाहुं शशिसूर्यनेत्रम् ॥**

Oi the two signs owned by Saturn, the Sun is made to feel the congestion more in Kumbha than in Makara. The reason for this is plain: (a) Makara is a benefic sign, while Kumbha is a malefic one. (b) Makaracomprises three Padas ( पाद) of Uttarashadha, all the four of Sravanaand the first two of Dhanishta. These asterisms are respectively ruled by the three friendly planets--the Sun, the Moon and Mars. The gateway of Makara is thus guarded by the Sun and the planet proves a friendly one to the sign. In contrast to this, Kumbha, a cruel Rasi, contains the full four Padas ( पाद) of the "Hundred Physicians” शतभिषक्which is ruled by the dark demon, Rahu. It is here that the Sun is supposed to lose his lustre and prove highly malefic to the eyes of the native when Kumbha happens to be the 7th. This means that the native should be born in Simha Lagna at the time of the evening twilight when the lord of the Lagna is placed in a Kendra where "Darkness" (Saturn) alone will get his full Directional Strength.

The notes given under Sutra 243 supra is also of a similar tone.

**२५२. सौम्यास्त्रिकेक्रूरैर्दृष्टा अन्धः।**

If benefics occupy the 6th, 8th and 12th houses and also be aspected by malefics, the person concerned will become blind.

**२५३. कुजेऽङ्गे कुम्भेऽन्धः।**

When Mars occupies the Lagna identical with Kumbha, the person concerned will become blind.

    There is much meaning in this Sutra. By a reference to the preliminary portions of Astrology, one will notice that the servant Saturn who is mean-minded is given a नीचposition in Mesha, the Moolatrikona sign of the Commander-Mars. Saturn appears to keep this in his memory and takes his full revenge when the Commander traverses Kumbha, his Moolatrikona. In such a condition, when this fixed sign rises with Mars in it, the 10th lordis powerless and loses his directional strength with reference to his own house (Vrischika). The goal of life is thus lost The effect I think will be more markedly felt, when Mars traverses Rahu's constellation. It may be noted that the blindness spoken of will be more felt in the left eye as the lord of the Lagna owns the 12th, the house representing the left eye.

**F. अथ चतुर्थविवेकःChaturttha Viveka.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**१. वृश्चिकांशे मातुर्दुग्धशोषः ।**

If the आत्मकारक Atmakaraka be in Vrischika Navamsa, the mother of the native will have no milk.

The word अंश-Amsa may also be interpreted as the rising Navamsa. A little analysis here seems to throw some light on the Sutra. There are nine Vrischika Navamsas in the zodiac, viz., Bharani 4, Mrigasira 4, Pushya 4, Purva Phalguni 4, Chittra 4, Anuradha 4, Purvashadha 4, Dhanishta 4, and Uttarabhadra 4. These constellations are owned by Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these are against the सत्व -Satva guna (बृ.जा.II-7) which is the essential element of milk. Further, Kataka, a milky sign, is not favoured by the three said planets, as (a) Mars is in depression there, (6) Venus is inimical to the Moon, its lord, and (c) Saturn owns the 7th and the 8th from it. It is to be noted that Kataka is the 4th place reckoned from Mesha (Kalapurusha's head) and hence represents 'Mother'.It is owned by the Moon, the general मातृकारक-Matrukaraka. Kataka in its capacity of milky ocean is the birth-place of the लोकजननी-Lokajananee, the Goddess Sri. Hence it appears right that the Sutra is aptly-worded.

If Venus or the Moon be betwixt two malefics, for beconjoined with or aspected by a malefic, there will be no happiness to the native from the mother.

It appears right to interpret this Sutra as “According as the birth is in day or night if Venus or the Moon, etc.' For, Venus is the मातृकार.-Matrukaraka in a day-birth and the Moon plays that role in the night (वृ. जा. IV-5).

**५. सुखे सुखेशे वा पापान्तरे पापयुतदृष्टे वा मातृसुखं न ।**

An analysis of the above two Sutras (171-172) will throw some more light on the subject. The conjunction of the lords of the 1st and the 6th houses is necessary to make the native feel afraid of either elephant or horse as the 6th lord controls everything connected with the six enemies (अरिषडवर्गे-Arishadvarga) of man, vis., काम-Kama, क्रोध-Krodha, लोभ-Lobha, मोह-Moha, मद-Mada, मात्सर्य-Matsarya. That Jupiter's association in the above brings about danger from elephants and the Moon's association likewise, fron horses, is a very interesting point. The foundation for this idea seems to be that Jupiter, the preceptor of the Gods, symbolises ऐरावत -Iravata, the gem of the elephant class, one of Indra's chief accessories. Further, ऐरावत -Iravata is the Eastern दिग्गज -Diggaja which direction is the most pleasing one for Jupiter. Likewise, the Moon who is supposed to have come from क्षीरसागर symbolises उच्चैःthe gem of the horse-class. This idea seems to be the basis for the above two Sutras. That Jupiter and the Moon by virtue of their bodies go to represent the elephant and the horse respectively is also a point in support of the two Sutras. For further elucidation on this subject, a reference to any of the 18 Puranas will be worthwhile.

  The Sutra under reference finds a very wide application as tliere is much sense in it. Aslesha 4, Jyeshta 4 and Revati 4 form the three Rikshasandhis (ऋक्षसन्धि ). Saturn must rise with it. Hence, a severe malefic rises with the Ascendant, casting his glance on the 7th. The Kalatra-karaka, Venus, is made to occupy the centre of the 7th Blava. In this particular position, Venus and Saturn inutually aspect each other, and one cannot think of a worse situation so far as the flourishing of the 7th Bhava is concerned. Venus is supposed to be blind and he is supposed to exercise his blindness in this position to the maximum. Further, Saturn, a eunuch, occupies one of the three constellations, all of which are ruled by another eunuch, Mercury. Thus the two eunuchs establish their relationship indirectly to spoil the yoga for issues. Further, if Venus were to occupy the centre of the 7th Bhava, he must occupy Mrigasira 2, Chittra 2 or Dhanishta 2, the Navamsa of which is Kanya, the depression Navamsa of Venus. Thus the Ascendant is associated with Saturn, while the 7th and its Karaka are associated with Mars (by virute of his ownership of the three constellations) and the two malesics spoil the pleasure of owning issues and thus make the wife of the native barren.

If Kanya be rising and the Sun be there and Saturn occupy Meena, the loss of wife is certain.

With reference to उ. का. 2nd Kanda-S1. 99 (p. 255) as well as बृ. जा. XX-9, Saturn is said to be highly beneficial to persons who are born when he rises in Meena. The application of this statement is solely confined to the cases where Meena happens to be the Lagna with Saturn in it and not in the case of other Ascendants with Saturn still in Meena. The phase of aspect in the latter case should proceed in the light of the inherent qualities of Saturn together with the part he is to play for the Bhava represented by Meena. In the present case, since Kanya rises, Meena stands for the marital happiness. A low.caste planet who is himself the lord of the 12th from the 7th occupies the 7th. He is in turn aspected by the Sun, the lord of the 6th fromthe 7th. Naturally Kanya is aspected by the black planet in his capacity of the lordship of the 6th, The native is thus shrouded in blackness (darkness). The source of this darkness seems to be the difficulties arising as a consequence of the ill-health of the partner, the loss of the partner, etc. In short, the conflict between the Sun and Saturn-brightness and darkness
-has a very striking effect and the native is made the poor victim. This is one of the worst yogas which usher marital disappointment. Cf.बृ.जा.XXIII-1, as well as Sutra 137 above.

By interpreting वक्र-Vakra as Mars, we come to a very important conclusion: Jupiter rises in the Ascendant. The Sun is in the 4th or the 7th Kendra. Venus now occupies the 5th house whose lord should be Mars. This would happen only when Kataka or Dhanus rises. Jupiter will be exalted in the first case, and will be in his Moolatrikona in the second case. Thus, the strength of the Lagna is assured in both cases. Kataka Lagna seems to be superior to the other inasmuch as Venus will then own a Kendra and be posited in a Trikona house.

There is no other possibility satisfying the conditions given. Mars and the Sun own the Dusstthanas and it is but right that they should be weak to produce the Raja yoga. There are further भद्र- Bhadra and हंस-Hamsa yogas here.

**१०२. धर्मेमन्दे उच्चे कुजे ज्ञेज्याच्छाः सुते राजाधिराजः ।**

If Saturn be in the 9th house, Mars, in his exaltation, and the three planets - Mercury, Jupiter and Venus be in the 5th, the person born will become a King of kings.

It is extremely difficult to find out the exact moment at which a Dasa changes. Almanacs and Ephemeris will have to be depended upon and they do not give the required accuracy so as to enable one to come to the correct moinent. In this connection, please refer to Kesava Daivagna's banter referred to in श्री . प. p. 142.

**४१. तत्रपाकेशे वा शुभे लग्नोपचयगे दशा श्रेष्ठा ।**

If the Moon passes through a house of Saturn, the native will be fully engaged in serving others.

**४४. त्रिकेतरस्थे सबले चन्द्रे दशा श्रेष्ठा ।**

If the Moon at the time of entry of a Dasa be strong and occupy a place other than any of the three Dusstthanas, the Dasa will prove very good.

**४५. मुख्यदशेशोच्चमित्रस्वभस्थः सन् दशेशाधिष्ठितराशित उपचयत्रिकोणास्तगश्चेच्चन्द्रः शुभफलदोऽन्यथा नेष्टः ।**

If the Moon occupy the Jasanatha’s exaltation sign, friendly sign or his own sign and occupy an Upachaya, Trikona or the 7th place with respect to the Rasi occupied by the Dasanatha, he will produce good effects and not otherwise.

**४६. चन्द्राधिष्ठितो राशिर्जन्मनि यद्भावगस्तद्भावोत्थं शुभमशुभं वा ज्ञेयम् ।**

Note the Rasi occupied by the Moon at the time of commencement of a Dasa; and the particular Bhava signified by the Rasi in the nativity. The effects of the Moon's stay there, whether good or bad, will relate to that Bhava.

At the commencement of the Dasa of a calamityproducing planet, if there be a planet possessing exceeding strength in every way and occupying benefic Vargas and aspected by a benefic or by a friend, the calamity will not happen but will be warded off.

**जन्माङ्गचन्द्रान्यतरतश्चारवशेनोपचयगो ग्रहश्चेन्मित्रोच्चमूलत्रिकोणाश्रितोऽष्टवर्गजं शुभं पूर्णमशुभं स्वल्पं दिशति, अन्यथा नेष्टं पूर्णंशुभं स्वल्पं, तत्रापि तारतम्यात् कथनीयम् ।**

If, with respect to the Moon or the Lagna at the commencement of a Dasa, the Dasa-lord occupy during his transit an Upachaya place, a friendly house, his exaltation, or his Moolatrikona Rasi, he will produce in full the effects derived from the benefic dots and will reveal only in a small degree the evil effects resulting from the malefic dots. Otherwise, the evil effects due to malefic dots will be fully revealed, while those due to the benefic dots, only in a small degree.' Even here, predictions will have to be made (or attempted) proportionately.

Balance of Mars' Dasa-2 years 8 months and 12 days.

The following Slokas find a direct application to this chart:

**कर्कटसंस्थः केन्द्रे बृहस्पतिर्दशमधामगः शशिनः ।  
चतुरुदधिमेखलायाः स्वामी भूमेर्भवति जातः॥**

If Jupiter be posited in a Kendra and in the 10th house reckoned from the Moon, identical with the sign Kataka, the person born will be the lord of the Earth, having the four oceans as the border.

**सारावली - ATTITS-XXXV-119**

If a benefic planet endowed with strength be in the Lagna and another strong benefic occupy the 4th house, and the other planets be in any of the following houses, viz., the 9th, the 2nd, the 3rd, the 6th, the 19th and the 11th, the person born will, if he be a scion of a royal family, be a king and be virtuously disposed.

**बृहज्जातक - XI-16**

**राश्यङ्गाधिपती मिथः श्रयगतौ तद्राजयोगप्रदौ ॥**

If the lords of the Lagna and of the sign occupied by the Moon were to exchange places, they bestow Rajayoga on the native.

**उत्तरकालामृत 2nd काण्ड SL.-89.**

Venus has just risen and has exchanged place with the Moon, both being lords of two Kendras. Both these planets are strong benefics and are feminine in character. They occupy Vargottamaamsas and are in चर(Chara or moveable) Rasis. These yogas are महाyogas. Vide फ.दी. VI-32 & 34.

The three Sutras-Viz. F-38, P-24, 25 find application here. Venus rising with Jupiter will naturally give an artistic tendency and in fact, His Highness was one of the best patrons of Fine arts. Tae lord of the Lagna being full in direction and that of the 2nd being strong with reference to it make the native acquire a psychic tendency of education and a lover of occult science. Rahu in Vargottama in the 3rd house coupled with the above conditions enabled the native to acquire a good knowledge of Urdu. Cf.उ.का-V-53.

Benefics are posited in Kendras and malefics (Saturn and Rahu) are in the 3rd and the 11th. (जा.त.N-87.) Mars being a Yogakaraka is not considered as a malefic. Regarding the religious trend of mind of the native, an analysis of the 4th and 9th houses is necessary. Ketu, the Moon and Venus respectively occupy the Vargottamamsas of Meena, Tula and Kataka. The Moon has exchanged place with Venus. The exaltation point of this inferior planet is occupied by Ketu (Revati 4) and thus Ketu finds an internal relationship with the Moon through Venus. This establishes the high ardent devotion which the native had towards the Goddess Chamundeswari. उ.का. V-53. Also फ.दी. II-27

Jupiter, the lord of the 9th house is aspected by Saturn, the lord of the 12th from the 9th, Saturn usually proves extremely malefic for Kataka when he casts his 3rd house glance and for Makara when he casts his 10th house glance. Further, the 9th house is subject to the aspect of Mars who is a पापिन्for Meena. ( उ. का. 2ndकाण्डS1. 96).

The Sun, the पितृकारक -Pitrukaraka, is in exact conjunction with Saturn. All these go to prove the अल्पायुस् Alpayus of the father, fixing his death for रा-श-गु(Rahu Dasa Sani Bhukti Guru Antara). The justification for this unhappy event is that Rahu by virtue of his position in the 7th (from the 9th) should prove a मारक-Maraka for the father. The भुक्ति-Bhukti must naturally be ruled by Saturn as he owns the 12th from the 9th. Jupiter rules over the 3577 inasmuch as he is aspected by Saturn.

The native was a saintly ruler, as is evident from the Sloka quoted above from बृहज्जातक.The lord of धर्मDharma, Jupiter, identifies himself with the body with full Directional strength and in company with the ministerial planet Venus in Vargottamamsa. This combination resulted in enabling the native to succeed in both the वैदिकVaidika as well as the लौकिकLoukika sphere. People credited with such balance of thoughts are rare and by the dernise of His Highness, the world has really lost a real Seer and it will be long before this gulf is bridged.

Balance of Mercury's Dasa -8 years, 5 months and 20 days.

Here is a horoscope on which greatness has been thrust by the planets. The result is peculiarly due to the inter relations commanded by the lords of the three Dusstthanas-the 6th, 8th and 12th. Mercury in association with Saturn and by virtue of his ownership of the 8th becomes cent per cent malefic. By stroke of luck, Mercury and Saturn are conjoined in the 6th--the best place to be occupied by malefics (cf.त्रिषडायगताःपापाः). The 3 planets,Mars,Mercury,and Venus respectively occupy Aslesha 3 ,Ashwini 4 and Ardra 4 , three of the correlative (पाद)Padas of the 108 Padas ofthe zodiac. These three planets are the lords of the respective Dusstthanas referred to above and thus establish a staunch connection which leads to the famous "inverted' Rajayoga cited in Uttarakalamrita IV-22. The two cycles-the positive and the negative appear to be incomplete, and this led to a tragedy. The positive cycle begins with the lord of the 1st occupying the 9ts, that of the 9th, the 9th from the 9th,i,e., the 5th. This cycle would have been complete had the lord of the 5th been in the 9th from the 5th, or the 1st. It is unfortunate that it is not so. So far about the positive cycle. The negative cycle has also failed. The lord of the 12th is in the 8th; that of the 8th is in the 6th; the third side is not complete, the lord of the 6th ought to have been in the 12th.

A discussion of the 9th and 10th bhavas i.e., the parent of the native-is worth while. The Moon, the lord of the 9th is in the 9th there-from in Revati 3. Meena is talked of as the लवणासागर(Lavana Sagara). The Moon is a milky planet, and his association with salt will end in bad result. (Vide उ. का. Kanda 2, sloka 96 wherein it is cited that the Moon is a malefic for Meena). But Revati 3 is identified as a line of pure water in Meena and that is the only favourable place for the Moon. The combination of Mercury and Saturn-lords of the 12th and the 8th, both reckoned from the पितृभाव -Pitru bhava-in the 10th from the 9th results in a very strong Rajayoga. This combination is further aspected by Jupiter; and the Yogakaraka for Kataka is in it. The Sun, the lord of the 2nd is in the 11th. All these go to justify the exalted position occupied by the father of the native. In fact the father is no other than the celebrated Raja Sir T. Madhava Row, K. C. S. L., Dewan of Baroda and Travancore. In this connection, it may be noted that the native hails from a family of Dewans, his uncle and his father-in-law being also Dewans of two Native States.

The पुत्रभाव (Putra bhava) is very badly affected. Jupiter, the lord of the 5th house, is camped in the 8th there from, a place owned by Venus, and in Visakha 2, a Navamsa owned again by Venus. The peculiar position of this it is that it is situated in the 8th sign from the 5th-the h पुत्रभावपूर्वपुण्यof the native- and the Navamsa - Visakha 2-goes to Vrishabha, the 8th from the 8th. Thus a curse on the 5th from Jupiter himself, who is the embodiment of Brahmin is apparent; thus denying completely the pleasure of owning children. The aspect of the two eunuchs on the lord of the 5th from the Lagna and on the पुत्रकारक
-Putrakaraka and also the aspect of Mars (another पापिन्Papin for Meena) over the same throw cold water to the fullest extent on the पुत्रभाव Putrabhava.

A comment on the 2nd bhava with special reference to eyesight is worth-mentioning. Three particular Sutras in this book, viz., C-232, C-237 and C-252 apply in this case. The 2nd house has Ketu in it, while Venus, the नंत्रकारक -is in conjunction with the dark planet Rahu (राहु) in आर्द्रा4 (Ardra 4), --a Rahu's constellation and is aspected by another dark planet Saturn. Saturn's aspect over Venus is full. Further, Saturn is भरणी(Bharani, a star ruled by Venus) while Venus is in आर्द्रा(Ardra, a star ruled by Rahu, whose nature is similar to that of Saturn vide फ दी.VIII-34). Hence there appears to be a sort of stellar exchange between the preceptor and the pupil,-between the blind and the lame. It may not be out ofplaceto mention here that a relationship between the two planets exists even in the Navamsa Chakra inasmuch as they occupy two उभय (Ubhaya) signs and aspect each other. Jupiter, the lord of the 2nd being aspected by Saturn and Mars, minimise to a great extent the eye-sight. The Sun in the 7th is another weak point for poor eye sight as he bears a quincunx aspect towards the 2nd and 12ththe two eyes.

We shall end our discussion with a coinment on the astrological reasons that led to the death of the native. The native died on Sunday, the 20th July 1919 in the morning. As we have ascribed the Rajayoga enjoyed by the native to the internal connection among the lords of the three Dusstthanas, Venus's Dasa though should have proved a मारक(Maraka) one, did not do so, but proved a beneficial one. The मारक(Maraka) as a consequence was transferred to the pupil-Rahu. The Bhukti (भुक्ति ) is ruled by Mercury who is posited in Aswini 4, a correlative पाद(Pada) to Ardra 4 (the position of Rahu). The preceptor (Venus) now takes his turn for the अन्तर (Antara). In fact, the native's death took place in राहु(Rahu)- बुध (Budha) - शुक्र (Sukra).

These arguments only go to show that Time is capable of utilising the same factor for making as well as for marring the man. if we do not try to understand the intricate net of Nature's Web, we have to find fault with our own intelligence and nothing else.
