      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/02/vedanga-jyotisha-and-other-ramblings-on-early-hindu-calenders/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vedA~NGa jyotiSha has been a strikingly difficult text to fathom despite its small size. It is the late vedic text that appears to be a quick and handy guide for calenderical calculations. It has attracted much attention of Western scholars, despite not understanding much of it. Yet they use it as a starting point to suggest how the Hindus were definitely astronomical idiots. This trend set by the early Western scholars regarding Hindu astronomy is repeated to this date as a part of their program to present the picture of “India as the cul de sac” (vide Michael Witzel, a German Indologist). The view of the early white Indologists on Hindu astronomy is epitomized by the American Indologist Whitney (the translator of the atharva veda)’s comments on the VJ: “And when we come to add that the Jyotisha (VJ) has no definable place in Sanskrit literature, or relation to the Vedic ceremonial.. we shall see that this famous datum, which has seemed to promise so much, has caused so much labour and discussion, and is even yet clung to by some scholars as the sheet-anchor of ancient Hindu chronology, is nothing but a delusive phantom.”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;While this and succeeding views of the white Indologists and their Japanese imitators have acquired wide currency, Hindu scholars have labored on interpretting the text correctly to a great measure. However, to give where credit is due an early white scholar Thibaut was fairly effective in interpretting a number of verses. The first Hindu scholar to make a major in road was S.B. Dikshit, who labored on this text not far from the place where I spent a good part of my life. Dikshit’s work unfortunately did not acquire wide readership because it was written in the Maharatti language. He was followed by the Northerner Chote Lala and Sudhakara Dvivedi the paNDita from Kashi who successfully interpretted a little more of the text, though they were locked in conflict between themselves. The great B.G. Tilak then further clarified some points. The final assault on the text along with a modern English translation was provided by the smArta savant shrI kuppanna shAstrI, who more or less interpretted most of the text. If we can today understand some of the elegant devices of the VJ, it is only because of kuppanna shAstrI’s enormous scholarship, setting the true standards for the kind of scholarship needed to tackle complex texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rajāmsi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth foot (प॒रो-र॑जसे॒ ऽसाव॒द् ओ३म् ॥) of the Sāvitrī implies that Savitṛ shines from beyond the rajas. What is this rajas, or more precisely the rajāmsi, since the Veda knows of a plurality of them. Vāmadeva Gautama says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;js_include&#34; url=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/jyotiSham/vedAH_Rk/shAkalam/saMhitA/vishvAsa-prastutiH/04/053/05_trirantarixaM_savitA.md&#34;  newLevelForH1=&#34;5&#34; includeTitle=&#34;false&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;js_include&#34; url=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/jyotiSham/vedAH_Rk/shAkalam/saMhitA/sarvASh_TIkAH/04/053/05_trirantarixaM_savitA.md&#34;  newLevelForH1=&#34;5&#34; includeTitle=&#34;false&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there is a clear emphasis on the tripartation in this mantra, the multiplicity of realms of the old Hindu cosmography is evident here. The rajāmsi are clearly distinct from the atmospheric realm (antarikṣa) and the realms of light (rocana).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/907061604981903360&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the 1800s historian of Hindu astronomer Shankar Dixit  asked several native astrologers asking if they could identify the nakShatra-s in the sky. Not one of them could correctly point even a few out n the sky- that was the general knowledge of the Hindu astrologer. However in contrast he found a shrauta ritualist from near Kolaba who was able to correctly point out all of them in the sky. He further cited an incantation from tradition that went at below: This contains the code to determine the rising point of the ecliptic from the nakShatra at meridian: e.g. if ashvayuji is at meridian i.e. at midnight then rising point of  ecliptic is 102 degrees on the ecliptic so on for each n&lt;/p&gt;</description>
