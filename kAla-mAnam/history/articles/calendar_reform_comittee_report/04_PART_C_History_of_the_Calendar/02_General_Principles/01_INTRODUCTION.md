## Time indicators

The Flux of Time, of which we are all conscious, is apparently without beginning or end, but it is cut up periodically by several natural phenomena, viz. : 

- (1) by the ever-recurring alternation of daylight and night, 
- (2) by the recurrence of the moon's phases, 
- (3) by the recurrence of seasons. 

It is these recurring phenomena which are used to measure time. 

These phenomena have the greatest importance for man, for they determine all human and animal life. Even prehistoric men could not help. noticing these time-periods, and their effect on life. 

## Agriculture

When human communities started organized social life in the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges (India), the Nile (Egypt), the Tigris and the Euphrates of Mesopotamia) and the Hoang Ho (China), several millenia before Christ (vide Chronological Table), these phenomena acquired new importance. For these early societies were founded on agriculture ; and agricultural practices depend on seasonal weather conditions. With these practices, therefore, grew national and religious festivals, necessary for the growth of social life, and of civilization. People wanted to know in advance when to expect the new moon or the full moon, when most of the ancient festivals were celebrated ; when to expect the onset of the winter or the monsoon ; when to prepare the ground for sowing ; the proper time for sowing and for harvesting Calendars are nothing but predictions of these events, and were early framed on the basis of past experiences.
