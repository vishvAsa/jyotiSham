title = "02 LONG PERIOD OBSERVATIONS OF THE MOON - THE CHALDEAN SAROS"

+++
The **moon gains on the sun** at the average rate of 12.2° per day, but it did not take the ancients long to discover that the daily gain of the moon on the sun is far from uniform ; in fact as we know now, it varies from approximately **10.75° to 14.5° per day**. It was therefore not possible to say beforehand whether the crescent moon would appear on the 29th or on the 30th day after the beginning of the previous month.

But the exact prediction of the day was a necessity from the socio-religious point of view. In India, the month was measured from full-moon to full-moon, and in the Mahābhārata, the great epic which was compiled from older materials about 400 B. C., it is recorded that sometimes the **full moon occurred on the thirteenth day** after the new-moon. This was taken to forebode great calamities for mankind. There were similar ideas in Babylon of which Pannekoek says: 

"When the Moon is full on the night of the 14th, the normal time, it was a lucky omen ; when full-moon happened on the night of the 13th, 15th or 16th, it was abnormal, hence & bad omen. Here astrology and calendar were merged ; deviation in the calendar was considered an unlucky, sign and had to be restored at the end of the month. A. Pannekoek: The Origin of Astronomy. 

Neugebauer says : 

"The months of the Babylonian calendar are always real lunar months, the first day of which begins with the first visibility of the new crescent. The exact prediction of this phenomenon is the main problem of the lunar theory as known to us from about 250 B.C. onwards." + 0. Neugebauer : Babylonian Planetary Theory. 

This is rather comparatively late date. The reason is that the accomplishment of this objective depends on the evolution of methods of exact astronomical observations, and of a method of recording them in precise mathematical language. Some ancient people never reached this stage. As far as we are aware, the **ancient Babylonians** were the first to evolve methods of observational astronomy. They also arrived at the **principles of angular measurements**, found the apparent paths of the moon, the sun, and the planets in the heavens, and discovered that it was only the sun's path (the ecliptic) which was fixed, and the paths of the moon, and the planets deviated somewhat from it. How this was done will be related later. 

But even before these accurate methods had been discovered, the Babylonian astronomers had learnt a lot more about the moon from long period observations. The most remarkable of these discoveries is that of the **Chaldean Saros**, or a period of **18 years 101 days**, in which the eclipses of the sun and the moon recur. 

The occurrence of solar or lunar eclipses, when the two great luminaries disappear suddenly, either partially or wholly, were very striking phenomena for the ancient and medieval people, and gave rise to gloomy forebodings. There were all kinds of speculations about the cause of the eclipses, e.g., that the sun and the moon were periodically devoured by demons or dragons. The ancient astronomers, however, found that a solar eclipse takes place only near conjunction (new-moon ), but every conjunction of the sun and the modn is not the occasion for a solar eclipse: A lunar eclipse takes place only near opposition (full moon), but every opposition of the sun and the moon is not the occasion for a lunar eclipse. 

In many ancient countries, China and Babylon for example, records of occurrence of eclipses had been kept. The celebrated Greek astronomer, **Ptolemy** of Alexandria (ca. 150 A. D.) had before him a **record of eclipses kept at the Babylonian archives, dating from 747 B. C.** They gave date of occurrence, time and features of the eclipse, whether they were partial or total. From an analysis of these records, the Chaldean astronomers tried to discover the laws of periodicity of eclipses, which ultimately resulted in the discovery of the Saros cycle of 18 years and 10 or 11 days. The basis of the Saros cycle is as follows: . 

We do not exactly know when the ancient astronomers outgrew the myth of demons periodically devouring the sun and the moon during eclipse times, and arrived at the physical explanations now known to every student of astronomy, and reproduced in the diagrams given below.

But when they arrived at **physical explanation of eclipses**, they had an understanding as to why there are no eclipses during every full moon and new moon. The **paths of the two luminaries must be in different planes**. This we take up in a subsequent section more fully, when we describe how the sun's path or ecliptic was discovered. 

Suffice it to say that at some ancient epoch, some Chaldean astronomer discovered that the moon's path was different from the sun's, and therefore **cuts the sun's path at two points, now called Nodes**. The condition for an eclipse to happen is that the full moon and new-moon must take place sufficiently close to the Nodes, otherwise the luminaries would be too far apart, for an eclipse to take place. 

The Nodes' now take the place of the mythical dragons which were supposed to waylay the sun and the moon, periodically, and swallow and disgorge them. In Hindu astronomy, the ascending node is called **Rahu** with the symbol ☊, and the descending node is called **Ketu** with the symbol ☋, the names of the two halves of the demon, who was cut in two by gods, so that the sun and the moon could get out. 

In very ancient times, it was found that the **two Nodes** were not fixed, but **moved steadily to the west**, so that the **sun took less than a year** to return to the same node. This time is known as the '**Draconitic year**' or year of the Dragons, and its length is **346.62005 days**. The time in which the **moon** returns to the same node is known as the **draconitic month** or the month of dragons. It is **stightly less than the sidereal** month; because the nodes regress to the west. Its value is **27.21222 days**.

Fig. 6—Showing a total eclipse of the sun.  

The Chaldeans appear to have found, about 400 B. C., that  
223 synodic months = 242 draconitic months. 

The reader can verify  
223 synodic month = 6585.321 days  
242 draconitic months = 6585.357 days 

From their long observations of eclipses, the Chaldean astronomers must have found that eclipses recur after an interval of **6585.33 days or 18 years 11.33 days** (or 18 years 10.33 days if 5 leap-years intervene). This cycle has been known as the Chaldean Saros. The extent to which a knowledge of the cycle is useful is given in the following modern table.

The problem of first visibility of the moon with which we started cannot therefore be taken up unless we describe how the path of the sun and the moon in the sky were discovered in ancient times. This is taken up in the succeeding sections.
