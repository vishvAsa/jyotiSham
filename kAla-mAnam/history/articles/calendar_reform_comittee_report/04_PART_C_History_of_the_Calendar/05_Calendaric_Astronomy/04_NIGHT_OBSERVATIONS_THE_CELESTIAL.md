title = "04 NIGHT OBSERVATIONS : THE CELESTIAL POLE AND THE EQUATOR"

+++

Almost all ancient nations were familiar with the night-sky either as shepherds, travellers or navigators, and were acquainted with more detailed knowledge of the revolving blue firmament studded with stars than the modern city dweller. The striking constelltions like the Great Bear, the Pleiades, the Orion could not but catch their fancy and references to these star groups are found in ancient literature, in the Vedas, in the book of Job (the Bible) and in Homer. In the last, the star-groups are used by sailors to find out their orientation. Representations of star-groups are found in ancient Babylonian boundary stones of about 1300 B.C. (see Fig. 15). 

Let us now see how these observations were made. 

Suppose, on a clear moonless evening in early Spring (say March ) and at about 8-30 P.M., we take our stand in a wide field undisturbed by city lights, and our vision is unobstructed in all directions. We now face the north. We shall find the appearance of the heavens as shown in Fig. (8) : 

Fig. 8-Showing the positions of Ursa Major (Saptarsi) at interval of 3 hours. 

In the north, a little high up to our right hand side we cannot fail to observe the conspicuous constellation of seven stars, called in Europe the Great Bear, but in India, the Saptarsi or seven seers. If we observe the heavens 3 hours later, we shall observe that the group has changed its position as shown in Fig. (8). Let us fix our attention on the two front stars (the pointers) of the Great Bear and join a line through them. The line joining these two stars appear to behave like the hands of a watch, for if produced they pass through a star half as bright at some distance, and appear to have revolved about it as centre. This star is called the Pole Star or Polaris, or Dhruva in Sanskrit which means fixed. If we observe throughout the night, we shall find that the Polaris remains approximately fixed, and the line of pointers continues to go round it. The next day, at 8-26 P.M., nearly 24 hours later they are again almost exactly at the same position. 

We naturally come to the conclusion that the whole starry heavens have been rotating round an axis passing through the observer and the Pole Star from east to west, and the rotation is completed in nearly 24 hours (exactly 23h 56m 48 of mean solar time). 

## Definition of the Poles 
The celestial poles, or the poles round which the rotation of the celestial sphere takes place may therefore be defined as those two points in the sky where a star would have no diurnal motion. The exact position of either pole may be determined with proper instruments by finding the centre of the small diurnal circle described by some star near it, as for instance, the stars belonging to the Ursa Minor group. Actually the so-called pole star is at present 57 minutes away from the correct position of the pole which is not actually occupied by any star. 

Since the two poles are diametrically opposite in the sky, only one of them is usually visible from a given place : observers north of the equator see only the north pole, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere. The south pole is not marked by any prominent star. 

Knowing as we now do, that the apparent revolution of the celestial sphere is due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, we may also define the poles as the two points where the earth's axis of rotation (or any set of lines parallel to it), produced indefinitely, would pierce the celestial sphere. 

## The Celestial Equator and Hour Circles 

The celestial equator is the great circle of the celestial sphere, drawn halfway between the poles (and therefore everywhere 90Â° from each of them), and is the great circle in which the plane of the earth's equator cuts the celestial sphere, as illustrated in Fig. (9).

Small circles drawn parallel to the celestial equator, like the parallels of latitude on the earth, are called **parallels of declination**. A star's parallel of declination is identical with its **diurnal circle**.

The great circles of the celestial sphere, which pass through the poles in the same way as the meridians on the earth, and which are therefore perpendicular to the celestial equator, are called **hour-circles**. Each star has its own hour-circle, which at the moment when the star passes the north-south line through the zenith of the observer, coincides with the celestial meridian of the place.
