APPENDIX 4-A Newton's Explanation of the Precession

In view of the prevailing confusion in the minds of Indian almanac makers regarding precession of the equinoxes, & short sketch of the physical explanation of the phenomenon originally given first by Newton is given here in the hope that those amongst Indian calendar makers who believe in science, may be persuaded to give up their belief in the theory of trepidation and be converted to the sayana reckoning advocated in these pages. This explanation will be found in any standard book on Dynamics or Dynamical Astronomy, e.g., in Webster's Dynamics. 

We have now to regard the earth as a material sphere, spinning rapidly round its axes, which is inclined at an anglo of π/2-ω to the plane of the ecliptic, where ω = obliquity of the ecliptic to the equator. 

The earth is kept in its orbit by the gravitational pull of the sun, which is situated at one of the foci of the earth's orbit which is an ellipse. Dynamics shows that the plane of the ecliptic is almost invariant, i.e., does not change with time, except a very small oscillation due to attraction of other planets on the earth. What is then precession due to ? 

This is explained by means of the following figure.

{{< figure src="../../../images/newton_precession.png" title="Fig. 21-Showing the precession of the equinoxes" class="thumbnail">}}

In the above figure (No. 21), C is the pole of the ecliptic EL\'L. Let γ₁ midway between E and L be the first point of Aries for year 1. Then the celestial pole is P₁, and the celestial equator is E₁γ₁Q₁. Due to precession of the equinoxes, the first point of Aries is slowly moving in the backward direction Lγ₂E along the ecliptic. If γ₁ shifts to γ₂ in year 2, the celestial pole shifts to P₂, along the small circle P₁P₂P₃.., where CP= obliquity of the ecliptic. The celestial equator assumes a new position E₂γ₂Q₂ in year 2. 

The celestial pole P therefore goes round the pole of the ecliptic C, and it makes a complete cycle in a period of about 26000 years as shown in fig. 22. 

{{< figure src="../../../images/celestial_pole_precession_circle.png" title="Fig. 22—Showing the precessional path of the celestial pole among the stars. (Taken from Astronomy by Russell & others)" class="thumbnail">}}

At present (1950 A. D.), the celestial pole is 58' from Polaris (a Ursa Minoris) which is a star of the second magnitude. CP, i.e., the line joining the pole of the ecliptic C to the celestial pole P continues to approach the Polaris up to 2105 A. D., when the pole would be only 30' away from the star and will then begin to recede from it.

It will be seen that the celestial pole has not been marked with a prominent star for most part of this period of 26000 years. About 2700 B. C., the second magnitude star α Draconis was the pole-star, as was probably known to tho ancient Egyptians, the Chinese and the Rg-Vedic Hindus. Conscious human history hardly goes beyond this period. The prominent stars which will become pole stars in future are : 

- γ Cephei............4500 A.D. 
- α Cephei............ 7500 A.D. 
- δ Cygni .........11200 A.D.
- α Lyrae (Vega)...13600 A.D. 

The last is a first magnitude star, the brightest in the northern heavens and can be easily picked up with the naked eye.

The phenomenon of procession of the equinoxes tells us that in addition to rotation, the earth has another motion, viz., a slow conical motion of its axis round the pole of the ecliptic which causes the equinoxes to move backward. The phenomenon can be visualized by reference to the motion of tops played by boys (Fig. 23). 

Fig. 23- Motion of a top. The spinning top, which is likened to the earth, causes 
processional motion of its axis. 

It is a matter of common experience with those who have played with tops that when the top is thrown spinning on the earth, the axis round which the top is spinning very often is not vertical, but is oblique ; and it is also having a slow motion in circle round the vertical as shown in fig. 23. This last motion is precessional motion. The top may be likened to the earth, and the vertical direction of gravity, corresponds to the pole of the ecliptic. The top would have fallen but for its spin. When it slows down, the top falls down the precessional motion of the top is due to the pull exerted by the gravity. 

Now turning to the earth, we see that as a first approximation, we may take it as a point of mass concentrated at the centre, and then deduce its orbit as is done in classical planetary theory. This would have been all right, if the earth were a homogeneous sphere. But the earth is not & sphere, but a spheroid, having its polar axis shorter than the equatorial axis by 43 kms. (= 27 miles). There is an **equatorial bulge** of matter. The pull due to the sun, is now equivalent to force in the ecliptic passing through the centre of the earth defining tbe orbital motion, plus a **couple**, which tends to turn the equator of the earth into the plane of the ecliptic. It is this **couple** which produces precessional motion. 

For details of calculation the reader may refer to a book on Rigid Dynamics, say A.C. Webster, Dynamics, pp. 298-302. 

We mention only the results here: 
If ψ be the angle of precession, i.e. the angle P₁CP₂, in fig. 21. we have due to the sun's attraction

ψ=3γm/(2Ωr³)((C-A)/C) (Cos ω)(t-(sin 2l)/2m)

where

- γ = gravitational constant=6.67 x 10- c. g. g. units
- C = moment of inertia of the earth around the polar axis
- A = moment of inertia of the earth around the equatorial axis
- ω = obliquity of the ecliptic 23° 26' 45"
- m = mass of the sun = 1.99 x 10³³ gms ; 
- r =distance of the earth from the sun = 1.497 X 1028 cms; 
- γm/r³ = tide-raising term ; 
- l = longitude of the sun ; 
- n = angular velocity of the earth; 
- Ω = angular rotational speed of the earth in radians.


If the earth were a homogeneous sphere, C would be = A, and ψ=0. But taking the polar radius c=a(1-ε), where ε=ellipticity of the earth, it can be shown that for the earth, in which concentric layers are taken to be homogeneous (C-A)/C = ε = 1/297 (nearly). 

But actually (C-A)/C is the mechanical ellipticity of the earth, the value of which has been found by observation as 1/304

Substituting the values as given above in the expression dψs/dt = 3γm/(2Ωr³) (C-A)/C (Cos ω)(1-(cos 2l)) we get the progressive part of the solar precession = 2.46 x 10⁻¹².

This is in radians per second of time. To convert it to seconds of arc per year, we have to multiply the expression by 2.063 X 10⁵ X 3.156 x 10⁷. 2.063 X 10⁵ being the number of seconds of angle in a radian, and 3.156 x 10⁷ the number of seconds of time in the year. We have therefore the rate of **solar precession = 16."0 per year**. 

We have now to calculate the action of the **moon** which, in spite of its much smaller mass, exerts a **far larger perturbing force** as the lunar distance is much smaller. In fact the **tide raising force for the moon is more than double that of the sun**. This makes the rate of lunar precession=34".4 per year. 

But there is another complication. The moon's orbit is not coincident with he sun's path (ecliptic) but is inclined. at an average angle of 5° 9', the extreme values being 5° 19' and 4° 59'. Further the points of intersection of the moon's orbit with the ecliptic travel round the ecliptic in a period of 18.6 years. The pole of the moon's orbit M therefore moves round the polo of the ecliptic C as shown in fig. 24 in a period of 18.6 years. The lunar precessional angle ψm has therefore to be defined from the instantaneous position of M. 

## Combination of the two precessional motions. 

{{< figure src="../../../images/combining_solar_lunar_precessions.png" title="Fig. 24-Combination of two precessional motions. " class="thumbnail">}}

The two precessions can be combined as in fig. 24. Here C, M are the poles of the ecliptic and of the moon's orbit. P is the celestial pole. The solar precession can be represented by the vector ψs, along the line PS perpendicular to CP, but the lunar precession is represented by the vector PR, which goes up and down as M goes round C in a complete cycle of 18.6 years (period of moon's node). Therefore the motion is equivalent to 

- ψ=ψs+ψm Cos MPC...parallel to PS. 
- ψn = ψm Sin MPC...perpendicular to PS. 

This causes certain **irregularities in the precessional motion and also in the annual variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic**, which would otherwise have been uniform. These periodic (period=18.6 years) variations are known as **Nutation**. 

## Annual Rate of Precessional Motion 
The solar and lunar precessions amount to 50.''37 per tropical year, with a very small centurial variation. After making necessary corrections for the slight motion of the plane of the ecliptic due to attraction of planets, the annual rate of general precession in longitude is obtained as follows: 

Rate of precession=50."2564+0."0222 T per trop. year, where T=Tropical centuries after 1900 A.D. 

The nutation in longitude may amount to +-17."2 according to different positions of the lunar node, but its effect on the annual rate of precession does not exceed +-5."8, so that the actual precession rate per year may vary between 44."5 to 56."0. 

The average rate of annual precession is not constant, it is very slowly increasing. The annual rate for certain epochs along with the period taken by the equinoxes to move through 1°, are however stated below - 

- Rate of precession 49."391 49.835 50.256 50.279
- Years 2000 B.C., 0, 1900 A.D., 2000 A.D. 
- No. of years per degree 72.89 72.24 71.63 71.60
