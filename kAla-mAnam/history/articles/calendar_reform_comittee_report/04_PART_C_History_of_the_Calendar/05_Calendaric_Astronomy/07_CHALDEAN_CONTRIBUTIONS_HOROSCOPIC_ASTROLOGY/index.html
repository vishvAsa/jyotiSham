  <h2 id="sun-and-moon-observation">Sun and moon observation</h2>
<p>We have seen that it was the needs of the calendar which gave rise to scientific astronomy which in the earliest times covered :</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Systematic observation of the movements of the moon, and the sun,</li>
<li>(b) Recording of the observations in some convenient form on permanent materials,</li>
<li>(c) Invention of mathematical methods to deal with the observations, with a view to predict astronomical events.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not, however, correct to say that it was the calendar based on the sun and the moon which provided the sole stimulus for astronomical studies. At one time, the planets strongly captured the attention of man (A. i Anekoek: The Origin of Astronomy, p. 351).</p>
<h2 id="planets">Planets</h2>
<p>The attention of mankind was drawn in remote antiquity to the five star-like bodies : Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn and Mercury.</p>
<p>Venus and Jupiter and occasionally Mars are more brilliant than ordinary stars. Sooner or later, it was found that while the ordinary stars remain fixed on the revolving heavens these five stars creep along them, as a modern author puts it, &rsquo;like glow-worms on a whirling globe&rsquo;, each in its own way. Venus appears as a morning and evening star, the maximum elongation being 47°. It early drew the attention of sea-faring people, its appearance on the eastern horizon indicating early sunrise to persons on lonely seas. But it took mankind some time to discover that it was the same luminary which appeared for some period as a morning star, then as an evening star. Its brilliance could not but strike the imagination of mankind. <strong>Mercury</strong> also appears regularly as morning and evening star, and it must have been <strong>discovered later than Venus</strong>, but still at such a remote age in antiquity that all traces of its discovery are lost.</p>
<p>The motion of the brilliant luminary, Jupiter across the sky attracted early attention ; Mars occasionally bursts into brilliance with fierce, red light, which could not but attract notice.</p>
<h3 id="retrograde-motion">Retrograde motion</h3>
<p>The three planets, <strong>Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn</strong> though generally moving to the east, from time to time reverse their direction of motion ( <strong>retrograde motion</strong> ), as shown in Fig. 11 +++(Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72FrZz_zJFU">YT</a>. )+++.</p>

<p>Although the planets always move in the same direction round the sun, their apparent motion among the fixed stars as seen from the earth, is not always in the same forward direction. They sometimes appear to move also in the backward direction among the stars, and this is known as the retrograde motion of a planet. The above figure reproduced from Pictorial Astronomy by Alter and Cleminshaw illustrates how Mars was seen to retrograde during June 24 to August 24.</p>

<p>By placing the sun at the centre and having the earth and the other planets revolve in circles around it, <strong>Copernicus (1473-1543)</strong> was able to <strong>explain the backward motion</strong> of the planets among the stars much <strong>more simply than in the Ptolemaic system</strong>. This is illustrated in the above figure, taken from Pictorial Astronomy, in the case of Mars as seen from the earth. The <strong>earth&rsquo;s speed is 184 miles a second</strong> while that of <strong>Mars is only 15 miles a second</strong>. As the <strong>earth overtakes</strong> Mars, the <strong>latter seems to move backward</strong>. The direct motion of Mars to the east is shown at positions 1, 2 and 3, backward or retrograde motion to the West at 4 and 5, and direct motion to the east again at 6 and 7.</p>
<h3 id="astrology">Astrology</h3>
<p>From very early times and amongst widely separated communities, mystical importance was ascribed to the wandering of the planets. These mystical ideas took a very detinite form in the shape of &lsquo;<strong>Planetary Astrology</strong>&rsquo; which grew in Mesopotamia during the period 1300 B.C. to 800 B.C. This Planetary Astrology is to be <strong>distinguished from an older form of Astrology</strong> widely found in Vedic India, which centred mainly round the <strong>moon</strong>, and the <strong>lunar mansions</strong>, and to a lesser extent on the <strong>sun</strong>. The conjunction of the moon with certain nakṣatras was considered lucky, others unlucky (vide § 4:1).</p>
<p>Planetary Astrology took the world by the storm after 300 B.C. and its influence was strongest during middle ages in <strong>Europe</strong>, till the rise of rationalism and modern science almost completely undermined this influence. But it still survives amongst the credulous in the West, but to a far greater extent than amongst the eastern nations.</p>
<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<p>What was the reason for the strong fascination which man has for astrology ?</p>
<p>Mankind has always a <strong>psychological weakness for omina</strong>, i.e., some signs which can predict future events, good or bad. The older form of omina were rather crude, viz., flight of certain birds like the crow, or movements of animals like the jackal or the snake, howlings of certain birds and animals. In many countries, sheep and goats were sacrificed to gods on the eve of great enterprises, and Augurs claimed to be able to interpret the intentions of the gods from an examination of lines and convolutions on the liver of the sacrificial animal ( Hepatoscopy ). Meteorological phenomona such as a lightning discharge, haloes round the moon, aurora were also regarded as ‘omens&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The older forms of omina were all apparently very crude compared to planetary omina which gradually emerged in Babylonian history from the time of Assyrian supremacy (ca. 1300 B.C.), for these appeared to be linked up with the mysteries of Heaven itself, and the <strong>astrologer</strong> enjoyed very great prestige amongst the public, for did he not possess the <strong>mysterious power of foretelling correctly the dates of eclipses</strong> !</p>
<p>Here are some of the samples of astronomical omina during the last centuries of Assyrian power (900 B.C.-600 B.C.).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercury went back as far as the Pleiades&rdquo;; &ldquo;Jupiter enters Cancer&rdquo; ; &ldquo;Venus appears in the East&rdquo; ; &ldquo;Mars is very bright&rdquo;; &ldquo;Jupiter appears in the region of Orion&rdquo;; &ldquo;Mars stands in Scorpio, turns and goes forth with diminished brilliancy&rdquo;; &ldquo;Saturn has appeared in the Lion&rdquo; ; &ldquo;Mars approached Jupiter&rdquo;; and so on.</p>
<p>There is not a trace of scientific interest in these texts ; the mind of the reporters is entirely occupied by the omens : When such or such happens, “it is lucky for the king, may lord”; or, &ldquo;copious foods will come&rdquo; ; &ldquo;there will be devastation&rdquo; ; &ldquo;the crops will be diminished”; &ldquo;the king will be besieged&rdquo; ; &ldquo;the enemy will be slain&rdquo; ; &ldquo;there will be raging of lions and wolves&rdquo; ; &ldquo;the gods intend Akkad for happiness&rdquo; ; and so on.</p>
<p>Yet, with all those observations, these reports represent is considerable astronomical activity. For the first time in history a large number of data on the planets had been collected ; it implies a detailed knowledge of facts about their motion.&rdquo; - Pannekoek: The Origin of Astronomy&ndash;reprinted from the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. III, No. 4, 1951, pp. 351-52.</p>
<p>The huge temples, called <strong>Ziggurats</strong>, ruins of which have been found in Mesopotamia, are supposed to have been dedicated to the <strong>planetary gods</strong>, each storey being assigned to a particular god. It was the <strong>duty of temple priests to keep the planets under observation</strong>, and record their positions on the only writing material available then viz., clay-tablets. Hundreds of thousands such <strong>clay tablets</strong> have been discovered in the ruins of Ziggurats, royal palaces and libraries, and patiently interpreted by western scholars like Kugler.</p>

<p>At first, planetary astrology appear to have been <strong>confined to states</strong>, and kings or powerful officials representing the state. But after the conquest of Babylon by the Persian conqueror Cyrus (538 B.C.), they appear to have been <strong>extended to private individuals</strong>. Thus came into existence &lsquo;<strong>Horoscopic Astrology</strong>&rsquo;, in which a chart is made of the 12 signs of the zodiac with the position of the planets shown therein, for the time of his birth, from which are foretold the events of his life and career. We are not interested in &lsquo;Horoscopic Astrology&rsquo; at all, but wish only to remark that but for the <strong>stimulus provided by astrology</strong>, there would not have been that intense activity during ancient and (from about 500 B.C.) medieval times, for <strong>large scale observations</strong> of the sun, the moon, and the planets, and compilation of tables of positions, which afforded the <strong>basis on which modern astronomy has been built up</strong>. In the large number of ancient horoscopes which have been studied by scholars, and in the astronomical tables compiled by ancient and medieval scholars, we have a huge amount of data on planets.</p>

The sign Capricornus, the 10th house, is on the meridian at the time of birth and so is in the south. The planets occupying the different signs are shown by the respective symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pannekoek observes : &ldquo;The circumstance that made this possible for astronomy was the occurrence of extremely simple and striking periodicities in the celestial phenomena. What looked irregular on occasional and superficial observing revealed its regularity in a continuous abundance of data. Regularities were not sought for ; but regularities imposed themselves, without giving surprise. They aroused certain expectations. Expectation is the first unconscious form of generalized knowledge, like all technical knowledge in daily life growing out of practical experience. Then gradually the expectation develops into prediction, an indication that the rule, the regularity, has entered consciousness. In the celestial phenomena the regularities appear as fixed periods, after which the same aspects return. Knowledge of the periods was the first form of astronomical theory.&rdquo; - Pannekoek: The Origin of Astronomy, p. 352.</p>
<p>The astronomical knowledge which the Chaldean astronomers bequeathed to the world are : -</p>
<p>(1) Conception of the celestial equator and racognition of the ecliptic as the sun&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>(2) A number of relations between the synodic and other periods of the moon and planets, viz.,</p>
<ul>
<li>1 year=12.36914 lunar months ; modern value =12.36827 lunar months.</li>
<li>Mean daily motion of the sun=59&rsquo; 9&quot; ; modern value=59'8&quot;.3.</li>
<li>Mean daily motion of the moon=13° 10&rsquo; 35&quot; : modern value=13° 10&rsquo; 35&quot;.0</li>
<li>Extreme values of the true motion of the moon : 15° 14&rsquo; 35&quot; to 11° 6&rsquo; 35. According to modern determination these limits are about 15° 23&rsquo; to 11° 46&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Length of the anomalistic month+++(=perigee to perigee)+++ - 27.55555 days; modern value=27.55455 days. +++(Remarkable! diameter of the moon varies only 11%. Kidinnu must have arrived at 269 anomalistic months=251 synodic months.)+++</li>
<li>Or 9 anomalistic months = 248 days ; modern value - 247.991 days.</li>
<li>Length of the synodic month=29.530594 days; modern value = 29.530588 days.</li>
<li>223 synodic months=242 draconitic months. This gave rise to the Chaldean Saros cycle of eclipses.</li>
<li>269 anomalistic months=251 synodic months. The length of the anomalistic month deduced from this relation=27.554569 days, the modern value being 27.554550 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Greek papyri gives longitudes of the moon for dates 248 days apart. This period is based on the Babylonian relation : 9 anomalistic months=248 days. After eleven such steps of 248 days, there is a big step of 303 days in the ephemeris. The length of the anomalistic month derived from these steps are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>9 anomalistic months=248 days. So, anomalistic month length = 27.555 days</li>
<li>11 anomalistic months=303 days. So, anomalistic month length = 27.545 days</li>
<li>11*9 + 11 anomalistic months= 3031 days. So, anomalistic month length = 27.5545 days</li>
<li>Actual value = 27.5545 days</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not sure whether these figures were arrived at by the Babylonians or by astronomers of other places. But these and the more accurate approximation of the moon&rsquo;s motion is found in the Panca Siddhāntika of Varāhamihira and is <strong>found used by Tamil astronomers</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="synodic-revolutions-of-planets">Synodic revolutions of planets</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Panca Siddhāntika</strong> the synodic revolutions +++(return to same position relative to the Sun as seen by an observer on the Earth)+++ of planets are given, but they apparently differ much from the actual figures. The figures are quoted in col. (2) of the table No. 9 below. The actual periods of the synodic revolutions in days are given in col. (3).</p>
<p>Table 9.&ndash;Synodic revolutions of planets from Pañca-Siddhāntikā.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planet (col 1), As given (col 2), Actual (days) (col 3), Converted from in P.S. (days) (col 4)</li>
<li>Mars, 768.75, 779.936, 779.944</li>
<li>Mercury, 114+6/29, 115.878, 115.870</li>
<li>Jupiter, 393+1/7, 398.884, 398.868</li>
<li>Venus, 575.5, 583.921, 583.880</li>
<li>Saturn, 372.66, 378.092, 378.093</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Thibaut in his Pañica Siddhāntikā could not explain the figures in col. (2). It can be verified that we can obtain the figures in col. (3) if we multiply the corresponding figures in col. (2) by 365.2422/ 360 . The figures obtained by such multiplication are shown in col. (4), which are found to be very close to the fgures in col. (3). The figures in col. (2) can be explained in another way, viz., they are in degrees representing the arc through which the sun moves between two conjunctions. In other words, the figures in col. (2), not being ordinary mean solar days, are &lsquo;<strong>saura days</strong>&rsquo; of Indian astronomy, a saura day being the <strong>time taken by the sun to move through one degree by mean motion</strong>, or 360 saura days = 365.2422 mean solar days. This explanation has been found by O. Neugebauer (vide his Exact Sciences in Antiquity). Most of these data were <strong>known to Hipparchos and also to Geminus</strong>, a Greek astronomer, who flourished about 70 B.C.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;astronomical science&rdquo; as evolved by the Chaldean astronomers, is seen to be in reality the by-product of the huge amount of astrological nonsense, a few pearls in a huge mass of dung, as Alberuni observed nearly ten centuries ago. Let us see when these &ldquo;pearls&rdquo; gradually crystallized out of the dung-heap.</p>
<p>Fig. 15–Two sculptured stones of ancient Babylon displaying the Sun, the Moon, Venus and Scorpion-symbols of a primitive astrological science which fathered the modern conception of astronomy.</p>
<p>Two texts called &lsquo;<strong>Mul Apin</strong>&rsquo; dated round about <strong>700 B.C.</strong> have been discovered which contain summary of the astronomical knowledge of the time. Here is one of the pertinent passages from Neugebauer&rsquo;s Exact Sciences in Antiquity (p. 96).</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are undoubtedly based on older material. They contain a summary of the astronomical knowledge of their time. The first tablet is mostly concerned with the fixed stars which are arranged in three “roads”, the middle one being an equatorial belt of about 30° width. The second tablet concerns the planets, the moon, the seasons, lengths of shadow, and related problems. These texts are incompletely published and even the published parts are full of difficulties in detail. So much, however, is clear : we find here a discussion of elementary astronomical concepts, still quite descriptive in character but on a purely rational basis. The data on risings and settings, though still in a rather schematic form, are our main basis for the identification of the Babylonian constellations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passage indicates that the Chaldean astronomers of this period could locate the north pole, and had come to an idea of the celestial equator, and could trace it in the heavens. We do not know when they came to the knowledge that the celestial equator cuts the horizon at the east and west points as determined by the gnomon.</p>

<h4 id="the-ecliptic">The Ecliptic</h4>
<p>From archæological records, it is generally held that a knowledge of the star-groups lying close to the ecliptic was obtained in Babylon as early as 1300 B.C., for some of the ecliptic star-groups like the Cancer, or Scorpion are found portrayed on boundary stones which can be dated 1300 .B.C.</p>
<p>Neugebauer and Sachs maintain that the ecliptic is first found mentioned in a Babylonian text of 419 B.C., but its use as a reference plane must have started much earlier, probably before 550 B.C. But the steps by which the knowledge of stars marking the ecliptic was obtained, are not yet known with precision. Only some guesses can be made.</p>
<p>The early astronomers probably observed that the bright stars Regulus (α Leonis ), Spica (α Virginis), the conspicuous group Pleiades, and certain fainter stars α Librae, α Scorpii were almost on the sun&rsquo;s path. The ecliptic could be roughly constructed by joining these stars.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-point-of-aries">The First Point of Aries</h4>
<p>The first point of Aries is the fiducial point from which all astronomical measurements are made. But how was this point, or any other cardinal point, say the first point of Cancer. ( summer solstice ), the first point of Capricornus. ( winter solstice ) and the first point of Libra, were located on the circle of the ecliptic in early, times ?</p>
<p>For rarely have the first point of Aries nor any other of the cardinal points been occupied by prominent stars during historical times. Even if for measurement, the ancient astronomers used some kind of astronomical instrument, say the armillary sphere, it would be difficult for them to locate the first point of Aries correct within a degree.</p>
<p>Probably the first stage was to determine the angular distance of heavenly bodies from some &lsquo;Normal Stars&rsquo; as indicated by Sachs. These normal stars were stars either on the ecliptic, like Regulus, Spica, or a Librae or some other stars close to it. Sachs gives a list of 34 such normal stars. (o A. Sachs, Babylonian Horoscopes, p. 53, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. VI, No. 2. ) Probably the ecliptic positions of these normal stars were determined after some effort by some method not yet known, and then the positions of other heavenly  bodies referred to the first point of Aries or the beginning of a sign could be found. The early observations are rough and no accuracy of less than a degree is claimed by any classical scholar for them.</p>
<p>Fig. 17–Babylonian Boundary stone showing lunar ephemeris engraved on it (A. 3412 Rev.) (Exact Sciences in Antiquity)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Regulus&rsquo; or α Leonis was the &lsquo;Royal Star&rsquo; in Babylonian mythology. In Indian classics, it is known as Maghā (or the Great ) and the presiding deity is Indra, the most powerful Vedic god. It is almost exactly on the ecliptic. Citrā ( or α Virginis ) is 2° to : the south.</p>

<h3 id="precession-of-equinoxes">Precession of Equinoxes</h3>
<p>But the first point of Aries is not a fixed point on the ecliptic, though all ancient astronomers belived it to be fixed once for all. It moves steadily to the west at the rate of 50&quot; per year. Astronomers of different ages must have given measurements of stellar positions from observations made either during their own times, or from observations made by their predecessors, quite unconscious of the fact that the reference point had shifted. The result is that the positions of stars given by different astronomers of antiquity do not tally, and the positions given by the same astronomer are not always consistent. This is illustrated in Fig. 19 of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>Let us take Hipparchos&rsquo;s First point of Aries ♈ as our standard point. Ptolemy&rsquo;s first point of Ariés ♈ is 4° to the west of Hipparchos&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Clay tablet records have been obtained in Mesopotamia which have been interpreted as representing two systems of Ephemeris known as <strong>Systems A and B</strong>. System B indicates that the vernal point is <strong>Aries 8°</strong>. This indicates that the observations were taken about 550 years before Ptolemy. This coincides approximately with the time of the <strong>Chaldean astronomer Kidinnu</strong>, who observed at Borsippa near Babylon, and is taken to be the <strong>author of the nineteen-year cycle</strong>. System A uses <strong>Aries 10°</strong> as the vernal point; the author of this system might have flourished 120-150 years before Kidinnu, and may be identified with <strong>Naburiannu</strong>, son of Balatu, who flourished about 490 B.C. Older still is the use of <strong>Aries 15° by Eudoxus</strong> of Cnidus, the first Greek astronomer to start a geometrical theory of planetary motion. This refers to observations dating from about 810 B.C. These dates, before they are accepted, should receive independent verification.</p>
<h3 id="the-use-of-spherical-co-ordinates">The Use of Spherical Co-ordinates</h3>
<p>The ancient astronomers were interested primarily in the moon and the planets but later about 150 B.C., Hipparchos gives lists of fixed stars as well with their positions.</p>
<p>It was clearly observed that though these planets keep near the ecliptic, they deviate by small amounts sometimes to the north, sometimes to the south. In the case of the moon, the maximum deviation amounts to nearly 50 (inclination of the moon&rsquo;s orbit to the ecliptic). In the case of planets, excepting in the case of Mercury and Venus, the deviation was not large.</p>
<p>In the case of the moon, a <strong>knowledge of the moon&rsquo;s celestial latitude</strong> was necessary for <strong>prediction of eclipses</strong> and therefore both the celestial longitude and latitude used to be recorded by the <strong>Chaldean astronomers of the Seleucidean period</strong>. In the case of planets, only the celestial longitude appear to have been used.</p>
<p>The Chaldean astronomers were the <strong>first</strong> to frame lunar and planetary <strong>ephemerides</strong> (i.e. calculation in advance of lunar and planetary positions— the pre cursor of modern Nautical Almanacs and Ephemerides) from about 500 B.C. But during these times, neither the knowledge of the sphere nor of spherical or plane trigonometry had developed. The Chaldeans had only developed the ideas of angular measurement which they expressed in degrees, minutes and seconds, the whole circle being divided into 360° degrees. Their methods, which have been elucidated by Neugebauer, Sachs and others were <strong>arithemetical</strong>. They took maximum and minimum values of astrononomical quantities, and <strong>interpolated</strong> for an inter mediate period, assuming the change to be linear (zigzag function, vide Neugebauer, Exact Sciences in Antiquity, Chap. V, Babylonian Astronomy).</p>
<p>It was the <strong>Greeks</strong> who introduced <strong>geometrical methods</strong> to deal with positions of heavenly bodies, and made the next great advance in astronomy. But they developed trigonometry only to a rudimentary stage vide § 4.8). But they also used Babylonian arithmetical methods alternately. Thus while Ptolemy uses the trigonometric chord functions in bis Syntaxis, in the astrological text, called Tetrabiblos, he uses the Babylonian arithmetical methods.</p>
<p>Though the calendar, as we have seen, gave the first stimulus for the cultivation of the astronomical science, the use of astronomy for perfecting the calender appears in the West to have come to a stop after the Seleucidean era. For Rome conquered the whole western Asia up to the Euphrates by about 80 A. D., and the Julian calendar replaced the Babylonian luni-solar calendar, which have, however, continued to currency probably in limited regions like Syria, Arabia and Iraq amongst certain communities. The Sassanid Persians also followed their own solar calendars inherited from Acheminid times. But the elements of the Chaldean luni-solar calendar have been used in a limited way, for the Christian ecclesiastic calendar for Christianity arose in Palestine and Syria, and the most important event in Christ&rsquo;s life, His <strong>crucifixion</strong>, is recorded in terms of the <strong>luni-solar calendar</strong> prevalent in Palestine about the first century A.D.</p>
