title = "09 DISCOVERY OF THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES"

+++

## Intro
In the previous sections, we have stated how the Chaldean and Greek astronomers started giving
positions of planets, and stars, with the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator—the first point of Aries-as the fiducial point. We shall now relate how the discovery was made that this point is not fixed in the heavens, but has a slow motion along the ecliptic to the west at the rate of ca. 50" per year. The rate is very small, but as it is unidirectional and cumulative, it is of immense importance to astronomy, and incidentally is very damaging to astrology. 

When the sun, in course of its yearly journey arrives at the first point of Aries, we have the vernal equinox. The first point of Aries is therefore also called the vernal point. 

## Possible awareness
The position of the vernal point has rarely in the course of history, been occupied by a prominent star, but in India, as narrated in § 5:4, its nearness to star groups as well as the nearness of other cardinal points to star-groups have been noted from very early times. Traditions of different epochs record different stars as being near to the cardinal points. But nobody appeard to have drawn any conclusion from these records (vide for details § 5:4). 

In Babylon also, different sets of positions of stars and planets record Aries 15°, Aries 10°, and Aries 8° (the zero is of Ptolemy's) as being the vernal point. But no Chaldean astronomer to our knowledge appears to have drawn any conclusion from these data. 

## Hipparchos
The first astronomer known to have drawn attention to the precession of the equinoxes was Hipparchos. He particularly mentions that the distance of the bright star Spica (α Virginis or Citrā). has shifted by 2° from the autumnal equinoctial point since the time of his predecessor **Timocharis** who observed at Alexandria about 280 B.C. He concluded that the autumnal point, and therefore also the vernal point, was moving westward at the rate of 51" seconds per year. 

It is not known whether Hipparchos considered the motion as unidirectional. It was impossible for him to say anything definite on this point, as observations extending over centuries are required to enable one to make a definite statement on this point. 

Though Hipparchos made, as time showed, one of the greatest astronomical discoveries of all times, which is all-important for the calendar, as well as for astronomy, its great importance does not appear to have been realized by either his contemporaries or followers for thousands of years. 

## Consequences
Let us, therefore, dwell a little on the consequences of this discovery. Later and more accurate observations have shown that the rate is nearly 50° per year, but is subject to variations which we may disregard at this stage. The shift is accumulative and in 100 years would amount to 1° 24', and in about 26000 years the first point will go completely round the ecliptic. The period depends upon certain factors and is not constant. 

The tropical year, or the year which decides the recurrence of seasons, is the time-interval for the return of the sun in its orbit, starting from the year's vernal equinoctial point to the next vernal equinoctial point. If these points were fixed on the ecliptic, the tropical year would be the same as the sidereal year, which is the same as the time of revolution of the earth in its orbit. But since the vernal equinoctial point slips to the west, the sun has to travel 360° 0' 0' - 50" = 359° 59' 10" to arrive at the new vernal equinoctial point, hence the **duration of the tropical year is less than that of the sidereal year** by about 20 minutes. In exact terms : 

- duration of the sidereal year = 365.25636 mean solar days 
- tropical year = 365.24220 at the present time. 

### Further Consequences of the Precession of the Equinoxes 
We may now consider some consequences of the precession of the Equinoxes. 

Hipparchos appears first to have marked out the beginning of the astronomical first point of Aries. It started go 8° west of the star α Arietis. Ptolemy had found that it had shifted by his time by about 3°, and gave the rate of precession as 36" per year. In this, he was wrong, the true shift being about 4°. Ptolemy in his 'Uranometry' gives the starting point of the sign of Aries as 6° to the west of ß Arietis, and the other constellations' marked at intervals of 30° may be marked out on the zodiac. The picture (Fig. 19) gives the boundaries of the different signs according to Hipparchos. The boundaries of the signs of Ptolemy would be 4° to the west of those of Hipparchos. 

By the time of Ptolemy, (and probably much earlier), a complex system of astrology had developed which connected men's destiny in life with the position of planets in the different signs at the time of his birth (horoscopy). It was claimed that even the fortunes of nations and countries could be calculated in advance from planetary positions in the signs. Though a few rational men like Seneca and Cicero were as much sceptical about the claims of astrology as the modern man, the general mass became converted to its claims, even astronomers not excepted. Even the great Ptolemy wrote a treatise "The Tetrabiblos' exposing the principles of Astrology. 

In fact, belief in astrology was one of the main incentives for the observation of the positions of heavenly bodies in ancient and medieval times which were carried out by medieval astronomers with so much zeal under the willing patronage of influential persons. 

The discovery of **precession is very disconcerting to astrologers**, for in the astrological lore, the signs are identified with certain fixed star-clusters ; whereas precession tends to take them entirely out of these star-clusters. Thus since Hipparchos's time, the shift has been nearly 30 degrees, and what was the sign of Pisces in Hipparchos's time has now become the sign of Aries, and the astronomical sign of Aries has now nothing to do with the Aries constellation, 

This consequence must have been foreseen by the followers of Ptolemy, and they probably started, more on psychological than on scientific grounds, to find out theories to mitigate the devastating influence of precession on astrology. Astronomers immediately following Ptolemy barely mentioned precession. It was first referred to by **Theon** of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.) who invented the theory of **Trepidation**, i.e., he said that the precessional motion was not unidirectional, but oscillatory. He gave the amplitude of oscillation as 8°. Probably this figure was suggested by the fact that at Theon's time the first point of Aries had shifted by a little less than 8° from Hipparchos's position, and Theon thought that it would go back and save astrology.+++(5)+++
 
**Proclos** the successor (410-485. A.D.), head of the Platonic Academy at Athens, a very learned man and one of the founders of Neoplatonism, **denied the existence of precession**! 

After the sixth century A.D. the dark age set in Europe and the mantle of scientific investigation fell on the Hindus and the Arabs. Let us see how the Arab astronomers regarded the precession. 

Thabit ibn Qurra (826-901 A.D.) +++(sabian of harran)+++, who flourished at Baghdad under the early Abbasides, translated
 Ptolemy's Almagest into Arabic ; he noted precession, but upheld the theory of trepidation. But the other great Arabic astronomers like al-Farghani (861 Baghdad), al-Battāni (858-Syria) +++(sabian of harran)+++, Abd al-Rabanān al-sūfi (903-986-Teheran) and Ibn Yonus (d. 1009– Cairo), all **noted precession and rejected the theory of trepidation**. In fact al-Battani gave the rate of precession as 54" per year, which is far more correct than the rate given by Ptolemy, viz., 36" per year. 

But unfortunately, Europe recovering from the slumbers of dark ages were more influenced by the **Spanish-Muslim astronomers** al-Zarquali (1029-1087 of Cordova). and al-Bitruji (ca. 1150, living at Seville), who upheld the theory of **trepidation**. As their influence was considerable, they were largely responsible for its diffusion among the Muslim, Jewish and Christian astronomers, so much so that Johann Werner (1522) and **Copernicus himself** (1543) were still accepting it; **Tycho Brahe and Kepler** had doubts concerning the continuity and regularity of the precession, but they finally **rejected** the trepidation. The theory of trepidation was completely given up in Europe after 1687, when **Newton** gave a physical explanation of it from dynamics and the law of gravitation. This is given in appendix (4-A), for the benefit of Indian astrologers and almanac-makers who still believe in the theory of trepidation and oppose reform of the wrong calendar they are using for centuries. 

Sarton from whose writings much of this account has been compiled, writes\*: 

"The persistence of the false theory of trepidation is difficult to understand. At the very beginning of our era, the time span of the observations was still too small to measure the procession with precision and without ambiguity, but as the centuries passed there could not remain any ambiguity. Between the stellar observations registered in the Almagest and those that could be made by Copernicus, almost fifteen centuries had elapsed, and the difference of longitudes would amount to 21°." \* Sarton, A History of Science, p. 446.
