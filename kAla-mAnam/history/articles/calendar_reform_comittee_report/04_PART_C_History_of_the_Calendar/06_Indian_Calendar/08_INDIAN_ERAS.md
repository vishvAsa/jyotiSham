title = "08 INDIAN ERAS"

+++
Whenever we wish to define a date precisely we have to mention the year, generally current of an era, besides the month and the particular day of the month, and the week-day. This enables an astronomer, well-versed in technical chronology, to place the event! correctly on the time-scale. In international practice the Christian era is used, which is supposed to have started from the birth-year of Jesus Christ. But as mentioned in Chapter II, it is an extrapolated era which came in use five hundred years after the birth of the Founder of Christianity, and its day of starting may be widely different from the actual birthday of Christ, about which there exists no precise knowledge.

In India, nearly 30 different eras were or are used: which can be classified as follows :

- (1) Eras of foreign origin, e.g., the Christian era, the Hejira era, and the Tarikh Ilahi of Akber.
- (2) Eras of purely Indian origin, list given.
- (3) Hybrid eras which came into existence in the wake of Akber's introduction of Tarikh Ilahi.

Table 27 shows purely Indian eras, with their starting years in terms of the Christian era, the elapsed year of the era*, the year-beginning, solar, lunar or both solar and the lunar as the case may be, the particular regions of India where it is current. Inspite of the apparent diversity in the ages of the esas, the methods of calendarical calculations associated with each era are almost identical to be more accurate only slightly different and follow the rules giyen in either of the three Siddhantas, Surya Arya and Brahma. The three methods differ but slightly.

\* Generally, but not always the Indian eras bave "elapsed. years". Thus year 1976 of śaka era would be, if we followed the western convention, year 1877 śaka (current).\*


The apparent antiquity of certain eras, e.g.. the Kaliyug or the Saptarṣi, are however rather deceptive, for these eras are not mentioned either in the Vedic literature or even in the Mahabharata (a work of the 4th to 2nd century B.C.). The best proof, however, that no eras were used in date-recording in ancient India is obtained from "Inscriptions" which give 'contemporary evidence of the method of date recording in use at the time when the inscription was composed.

In India, the oldest inscriptions so far discovered and deciphered satisfactorily are those of the Emperor Asoka (273 to 227 B.C.); for the earlier Indus valley seal recordings have not yet been deciphered and no inscriptions or seals which can be referred to the timeperiod between 2500 B.C. (time of Indus valley civilization) and 250 B.C. ( time of Asoka ) have yet been brought to light. Asoka mentions in his inscriptions only the number of years elapsed since his coronation. No month, week-day or the serial number of the day in the month is mentioned. A typical Asokan inscription giving time references is given in $5.5.

Continuous eras first began to be used in the records of the Indo-Scythian kings who reigned in modern Afghanistan and North-Western India between 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.

What is then the origin of the Kaliyuga or Saptarṣi era given in Table 27 which go back to thousands of years before Christ? We are going to show presently that they are extrapolated eras invented much later than the alleged starting year.

It is clear from historical records that date-recording by an era in India started from the time of the Kuśāna emperors and śaka satraps of Ujjain. But India cannot be singled out in this respect, for none of the great nations of antiquity, viz., Egypt, Babylon, Assyria or later Greece and Rome, used a continuously running era till rather late in their history. The introduction of the era is connected with the development of the sense of 'History' which came rather late to all civilized nations.

## Critical Examination of Indian Eras

Here we are examining critically the claims of a few eras, which we supposed to date much earlier, e.g.) the Kaliyuga era which is commonly believed to have been introduced in 3102 B.C. the Saptarṣi era, and the Paṇḍava-Kala mentioned by Kalhaṇa, the historian of Kashmir, who wrote in 1150 A.D., and supposed to be dating from 2449 B.C., and others. The Saptarṣi era commonly known as Lokakāla or Laukika Kala is measured by centuries and has 27 sach centuries in the total period of the cycle. Each century is named after a nakṣatra, viz.. Aśvinī, Bharaṇī, etc; and the number of years within the century is generally mentioned, so that the number of year of the era never exceeds 100. This era was in use in Kashmir and neighbouring places. In fact this era bas no relation with the seven r̥ṣi-s (the Great Bear) in the sky or with any actual nakṣatra division. 

There is difference of opinion as to the beginning of the era. According to Vr̥ddha Garga and the Purāṇas the starting year of the tenth century named after Magha are 3177 B.C.+++(←Seems off)+++, 477 B.C. and 2224 A.D. of the different cycles, when according to Varahamihira the third century named Kịttikā begins. The beginning years of Varahamihira's Magha century of the different cycles are however 2477 B. C., 224 A. D. and 2924 A.D.

The Paṇḍava Kala or the Yudhisthira era started from 2449 B.C. according to Varāhamihira. The so-called Yudhisthira era (2449 B.C.) is given by Kalhana, chronicler of Kashmir (1150 A.D.), who quotes the date from Vr̥ddha Garga, an astronomer whose time is unknown. This era also does not occur in any inscription or any ancient treatise prior to Kalhaṇa (1150 A.D.). Prof. M. N. Saha has shown that in the Mahabharata the Kr̥ttikās are in many places taken as the first of the nakṣatras and are very nearly coincident with the vernal equinox. If we calculate the date of the M.Bh. incidents on this basis, the date comes out to be very nearly 2449 B.C.

It, however, niether proves that the incidents mentioned in the M.Bh., if they were actual occurrences, took place in 2449 B.C., for the epic was, not certainly put to writing before 400 B.C. as we know from a verse already mentioned on p. 226. It is inconceiveable to think that the dates could be remembered correctly for over 2000 years, when writing was in a very primitive state. The astronomical references in the battle scenes, from which certain writers very laboriously deduce the date of these occurrences, are most probably later interpolations, on the supposition that the incidents occurred about 2449 B.C. There is no inscriptional record regarding the use of Yudhisthira era or Paṇḍavakāla.

### (a) The Kaliyuga Era
It is easy to show that the Kaliyuga era which purports to date from 3102 B.C. is really an extrapolated era just like the Christian era, introduced long long after the supposed year of its beginning.

It is first mentioned by āryabhaṭa, the great astronomer of ancient Pāṭalīputra, who says that' 3600 years of the Kaliyuga had passed when he was 23 years old which is śaka year 421 (499 A. D.). It is not mentioned earlier either in books or in inscriptions. The first mention of this era in an inscription is found in the year 634-35 A.D., the inscription being that of king Pulakeśin II of the Cālukya dynasty of Badāmī. or somewhat earlier in a Jain treatise. It was most probably an era invented on astrological grounds just like the era of Nabonassar, by āryabhaṭa or some other astronomer, who felt that the great antiquity of Indian civilization could not be described by the eras then in use (śaka, Chedi or Gupta era) as they were too recent.+++(5)+++

#### What were these astrological grounds ? 
The astrological grounds were that at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, the sun, the moon and the planets were in one zodiacal sign near the fixed Siddhantic Mesadi which according to some authorities is Piscium, but according to others is 180° from Citra or a Virginis. This was probably a back calculation based on the then prevailing knowledge of planetary motion, but has now been found to be totally wrong when recalculated with the aid of more accurate modern data on planetary motion.+++(5)+++ We quote from Ancient Indian Chronology. pp. 35-39 by Prof. P. C. Sengupta, who has given a full exposition of Burgess's views on this point, with recalculations of his own.

#### "Astronomical Kaliyuga an Astronomical Fiction"
At the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga, all the menn places of the planete, viz., the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, are taken to have been in conjunction at the beginning of the Hindu sphere, the moon's apogee and her ascending node at respectively quarter circle and a half circle ahead of the same intial point. Under such a conjunction of all the planets, there should also be total eclipse of the Sun ; but no such things happened at that time.+++(4)+++ The beginning of the Kaliyuga was the midnight at Ujjayinī terminating the 17th February of 3102 B.C., according to Sūrya Siddhanta and the ardha-rātrika system of āryabhaṭa's astronomy as described in the Khaṇḍa-khādyaka of Brahma-gupta. Again this Kaliyuga is said to have begun, according to the āryabhaṭīya from the sunrise at Lanka (supposed to be on the equator and on the same meridian with Ujjain)-from the mean sunrise on the 18th Feb., 3102 B.C.

Now astronomical events of the type described above and more specially the conjunction of the sun and the moon cannot happen both at midnight and at the next mean sunrise. This shows that this Kaliyuga had an unreal beginning.

The researches of Bailey, Bentley and Burgess have shown that a conjunction of all the planets' did not happen at the beginning of this Kaliyuga. Burgess rightly observes: 'It seems hardly to admit of a doubt that the epoch (the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyugn) was arrived at by astronomical calculation carried backward.

We also can corroborate the findings of above researchers in the following way and by using the most up-to-date equations for the planetary mean elements.

Now the procession of the equinoxes from 3102 B. C. to 499 A.D. or āryabhaṭa's time works out to have been = 49° 39' 39". The mean planetary elements at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, i.e., 17th Feb., 3102 B.C. Ujjayini mean time 24 hours, are worked out and shown below. We have added 49° 32' 39" to these mean tropical longitudes arrived at from the rules used, so as to get the longitudes measured from the vernal equinox of āryabhaṭa's time.

Hence we see that the assumed positions of the mean planets at the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga were really incorrect and the Assumption was not a reality. But of what use this assumption was in āryabhaṭa's time, i.e., 499 A.D., is now set forth below.'

āryabhaṭa says that when he was 28 years old, 3600 years of Kali had clapsed. According to his Ardharatrika system:

8600 years 1/1200 of Mahayaga=1314981.5 days. 

Again according to his Audayika system :
3600 years=1/1200 of a Mahayuga=1314931.25 days.

Hence according to both these systems of astronomy of āryabhaṭa, by counting 3600 years from the beginning of the astronomical Kali epoch, we arrive at the date March 21, 499 A.D., Ujjayini mean time, 12 noon. The unreality of the Kali epoch is also evident from this finding. However, the position of mean planets at this time work out an given in table 26 below.

It is thus clear that the beginning of the Hindu astronomical Kaliyuga was the result of a back calculation wrong in its data, and was thus started wrongly. • It is also established that the astronomical Kaliyugarockoning is a pure astronomical fiction created for facilitating the Hindu astronomical calculations and was designed to be correct only for 499 A.D. This Kali-reckoning cannot be earlier than the date when the Hindu scientific Siddhantas really came into being. As this conclusion cannot but be true, no Sanskrit work or epigraphio evidences would be forthcoming as to the use of this astronomical Kali-reckoning prior to the date 499 A.D".

### (b) The Vikrama Era 

The Vikrama Era is widely prevalent in Northern India, excepting Bengal, and used in inscriptions from the ninth century A.D. Let us probe into its origin.

In popular belief, the Vikrama era was started by king Vikramaditya of Ujjain who is claimed to have repelled se attack on this famous city by śaka or Scythian hordes about 57 B. C. and founded an era to commemorate his great victory.

Unfortunately no historical documents or inscrip ions have yet been discovered showing clearly the xistence of a king Vikramaditya reigning at Ujjain about 57 B. C. Moreover a critical examination of inscriptions show the following details about this era.

The earliest mention of this era, where it is definitely connected with the name of king Vikratos ditya is found in an inscription of one king Jaikadeva who ruled near Okhamandal in the Kathiawar States The year mentioned is 794 of Vikrama era, i.e., 737 A.D. In a subsequent inscription, dated 795 V.E. it is also called the era of the lords of Malava. So the Vikrama era and the era of Malava lords are one and the same. Tracing back, we find the Malavagana era in use by a family of kings reigning at Mandasor, Rajputana between the years 461-589 V.E., as feudatories to the Imperial Guptas (319-550 A.D.). They call it not only the era of the Malava tribe, but also alternatively as the Kộta era. A number of inscrip tions bearing dates in the Kộta era bave been found in Rajasthan, and the earliest of them goes back to the year 282 of the Krta era (The Nandsa Yupa inscription described by Prof. Altekar, Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XXVII, p. 225).

From these evidences, it has been concluded by historians that the earliest name so far found of this era was Kộta. What this means is not clear. Then between 405-542 A.D. it came to be known as the era of the Malava tribe and was used by the Verma kings of Mandasor, Rajputana, though they were feudatories of the Gupta emperors (319-550 A.D.). Its association with king Vikrama is first found in the year 737 A.D., nearly 800 years after the supposed date of king Vikrama. Its use appears to bave been at first confined to Kathiawar and Rajasthan, for the whole of Northern India used between 320 A.D. to 600 A.D., the Gupta era, which fell into disuse with the disappearance of the Gupta rule in 550 A.D. For a time, Northern India used the Harsa era introduced by the emperor Harsa Vardhana (606 A.D.), but when the Gurjara-Pratibars, who came from Rajasthan, conquered the city of Kanauj about 824 A.D., they brought the Vikrama era from their original home, and it became the current era all over northern India except the eastern region, and was used by all Rajput dynasties of medieval times.

The months of the Vikrama era are all lunar, and the first month is Caitra. The months begin after the full-moon but the year begins 15 days after the fullmoon of Phalguna, i.e. after the new-moon of Caitra. But for astronomical calculations, it is pegged on to a solar year, which starts on the first of solar Vaisakha, theoretically the day after the vernal equinox. The Vikrama era is current also in parts of Gujrat, but there the year begins in Kartika and the months are amantai which corresponds to the Macedonian month of Dios, and the epoch is just six months later. Thus the western and northern varieties of the Vikrama era follow respectively the Macedonian and Babylonian reckonings (see $3.3). the year of starting is 255 years later than that of the Seleucidean era.

The conclusion is that the champions of the Vikrama era have still to prove the existence of king Vikrama of Ujjain. Early inscriptions show that the method of date-recording is not typically Indian as in the Satavahana inscriptions but follow the śaka Kusina method, which follows the contemporary Graeco Chaldean method. It was therefore a foreign reckoning introduced either by the Greeks or śakas, or an Indian prince or tribe who had imbibed some Graeco-Chaldean culture, but was adopted by the Malava tribes who migrated from the Punjab to Rajasthan about the first century B.C. The association with a king Vikrama occured 800 years later, and is probably due to lapse of historical memory, for the only historical king Vikramaditya who is known to have crushed the śaka power in Ujjain, was king Candragupta II of the Gupta dynasty (about 395 A.D.). Before this, the śaka dynasty in Ujjain had reigned almost in unbroken sequence from about 100 A.D. to 395 A.D., and had used an era of their own, later known as the "śaka' era. All the Gupta emperors from Samudragupta, had an "Aditya" title, and many of them had the title "Vikramaditya" so that the Gupta age was par excellence the age of Vikramadityas. But all the Gupta emperors use in their inscriptions the family era called the Guptakāla which commemorated the foundation of Gupta empire (319 A.D.). The association of the Malava era with king Vikramaditya, and assignment of king Vikramaditya to Ujjain, was due to confusion of historical memory not infrequent in Indian history. It may be mentioned that the Vikrama era is never used by Indian astronomers for their calendaric calculations, for which puapose the śaka era is exclusively used.

### (c) The śaka Era
The śaka Era is the era par excellence which has been used by Indian astronomers all over India in their calculations since the time of the astronomer Varaha mihira (died 587 A.D.) and probably earlier. The Indian almanac-makers, even now, use the śaka era for calculations, and then convert the calculations to their own systems.

This era is extensively used over the whole of India except in Tinnevelly and part of Malabar, and is more widely used than any other era. It is also called śaka Kala, śaka Bhopa Kala, Sakendra Kala, and Salivahana śaka and also śaka Samvat. Its years are Caitrādi for luni-solar reckoning and Meside for solar reckoning. In the luni-solar reckoning the months are parmimanta in the North and amanta in Southern India. The Teckoning of the śaka era begins with the vernal equinox of 78 A.D., and is measured by expired years, so the year between the vernal equinox of 78 A.D. to that of 79 A.D. is xero of śaka era. In some pañcangas of Southern India the current year is however seen to be used instead of the elapsed year, where the number of year of the era is one more than the era in general use

But we are not yet sure about the origin of this era. It has been traced back to the śaka satraps of Ujjain, from the year 52 (130 A.D.) to the end of the dynasty about 395 A.D. But in their own records, they merely record it as year so and so, but there is not the slightest doubt that the era used by them subsequently became known as the śaka era (ride$ 5.5)

The Old and the New śaka era. The dates given by different authorities about the starting year of the old śaka en mentioned in $ 55 vary from 155 B.C. to 88 B.C. as given below: Konow : 88 B.C. (date of death of Mithradates II, the powerful Parthian emperor who is said to have subjugated the śakas). Konow has proposed a number of other dates. Jayaswal : 120 B.C. : . Herzfeld : 110 B.C. : Settlement of the śakas in ...Seistan by Mithradates II. Rapson : 150 B.C. : Establishment of the śaka kingdom of Seistan. Tarn: 155 B.C.: Date of settlement of the śaka immigrants in Seistan by Mithradates I. Recently Dr. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw has discussed the starting point of this era in her thought-provok ing book 'The Scythian Period of Indian History'. She has Tejected all the above dates, and fixed up 129 B.C. as the starting date of the old śaka era. She identifies this year as the one in which the śakas, descending from the Trans-Oxus region, attacked the Parthian empire in which the Parthian emperor Phraates II was defeated and killed, and the rich province of Bactria was occupied by the śakas. They founded an era to commemorate their victory over the Parthians which their successors took to India, as they expanded and put an end to the Bactrian Greek principalities in Afghanistan and north-west Punjab. She suggests that the old śaka era was also used by the Kuṣaṇas, who were after all a Sakish ruling tribe, but from the time of Kaniska with hundreds omitted.

Dr. M. N. Saba has supported this theory in its main features, but he thinks that the era was founded in 123 B.C., for he shows from historical records that the śakas assailed Bactria first in 129 B.C. and entered into a seven year conflict with the Parthians, and finally conquered Bactria in 123 B.C., when the Parthian emperor Artabanus II, was defeated and killed. Probably the śakas then founded their era. This was also called the era of Azes. Dr. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw has accepted Saha's suggestion.

This hypothesis, though not finally settled appears to have a good deal of probability, for the following reasons :

Dr. Saha points to the fact that Indian classics, which can be dated from the third century B.C. to the second century A.D., mentions three races in what is modern Afghanistan and N. W. India, viz., the śakas, the Yavanas, and the Pallavas, who attained to the status of ruling races. The order in which they are mentioned denotes correct chronological sequence, for they are arranged in the order of their chronological appearance in history, the śakas being mentioned as a subject race in Darius's inscription (518 B.C.). But the Yavanas (Greeks) were the first to attain the status of a ruling race, from 312 B.C., the date of foundation of the Seleucid empire, whose power in the west was overthrown by the Parthians, or Pehlevis (Pallavas of Indian classics) in 248 B.C.

Both these ruling races of Yavanas and Pallavas used eras of their own, viz., the Seleucidean era from 312 B.C., and the Parthian era from 248 B.C. Did the third race, rit. the śakas who were the last to attain status of a ruling race ever see an era of their own ? It would be surprising if they did not, for it became the fashion for all races, who attained the status of ruling people, to have eras of their own. The early śakas, -as their records showe were deeply influenced by their neighbours to the west, viz., the Parthians who adopted Greek culture, and their coin-records show that they also adopted Greek culture, and therefore most probably, the Graeco-Chaldean method of date recording.

The points given in 85.5 and above may be summarized as follows :

(a) The śakas starting from Central Asia' attacked the Parthian empire in 129 B.C., and overcame Parthian resistance by 123 B.C. It is very probable that they started an era to commemorate their accession to power in Bactria from 123 B.C. They used Macedonian months and Graeco-Chaldean methods of calendaric calculations as prevalent in the Seleucid and Parthian dominions. Probably the era was sometimes named after Azes, who was probably their leader. But this Azes is not to be confounded with later Azes I or Azes II, who reigned in Taxila between 40 B.C. and 20 B.C. Within the first 200 years of its starting, the era was alternatively called the Azes era.

(b) This śaka era (known to archaeologists as the old śaka era ) was used by the śaka emperors and śaka Satraps in their Indian territories, but the timereckoning began to be gradually influenced by Indian customs. They began to use Indian months alternatively with Macedonian months and Parnuanta months in place of Amanta months. During the first 200 years, the hundreds were sometimes omitted, in the use of the era.

(c) The so-called Kaniska era is nothing but the old śaka era with 200 omitted.

(d) The śaka era was used by the house of Caṣtana of Ujjain with 200 omitted, but gradually they forgot the origin of the era and continued their own reckoning without further omission of hundreds upto the end of the śaka satrapal rule over Ujjaint about 395 A.D. As the early Indian astronomers were mostly of foreign origin (viz. śakadvipi Brahmana) the astronomical reckonings necessary for compiling the calendar were carried out using the śaka era and Graeco-Chaldean astronomy. The blending of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy as known about the early years of the Christian era with older Indian calendarical features formed the basis of Siddhanta Jyotisa. The śakadvipi Brahmins also brought to India horoscopic astrology using the śaka era exclusively in horoscopes, a custom which has persisted to this day. These facts explain the pre-eminence of the śaka era.
### (d) Other Eras
#### Buddha Nirvana Era 
The Buddhists of Ceylon have been using since the first century B.C. the Buddhist Nirvana era, having its era-beginning in 544 B.C. This era has not however been found in use on the Indian soil, except for a solitary instance in an inscription of Asokachalla Dey found at Gaya dated in the year 1813 of the Buddhist Nirvana era - 1270 A.D. Most of the antiquarians however put the date of Nirvāna in 483 B.C. The origin of the Buddha Nirvana era used in Ceylon has not yet been satisfactorly explained.
#### The Gupta Era
This era was clearly lestablished by the founder of the Gupta dynasty (Candragupta I) to commemorate the accession to imperial power of his family, about 319 A.D., and was in vogue over the whole of Northern India from Saurashtra to Bengal during the days of their hegemony (319 A.D.-550 A.D.). After the decay of their empire, the era was continued by their former vassals, the Maitrakas of Vallabhi and was in use in parts of Guzrat and Rajputana up to the thirteenth century. Its use in Bengal was discontinued from about 510 A.D. with the disappearance of Gupta rule first in South Bengal, then over the whole of Eastern India. In the Uttar Pradesh (ancient Madhyadeśa), it was driven out by the Harsa era, which had a short period of existence, 606-824 A.D., when the city of Kanauj was occupied by king Nagabhata of the Pratibar dynasty, who hailed from Rajasthan. The Pratibārs brought with them the Vikrama era, which had been current in Rajasthan, and this became the great era of the north, used by all medieval Rajput dynasties, except those belonging to the eastern region.

#### Eras in Eastern India
Most parts of Bengal were under the Gupta emperors, and used the Gupta era during their hegemony (319-510 A.D.). But Gupta rule disappeared as mentioned above from major parts of Bengal from ca. 510 A.D., and the subsequent dynasties including the Pala emperors ( 750 A.D.-1150 A.D.) used regnal years in their inscriptions for four hundred years of their rule. The śaka era in Bengal appear to bave been introduced by the Sena dynasty which replaced the Palas; the Senas were migrants from the south (Karpaţa-Ksatriyas ), where they were familiar with the śaka era, but it was not used in royal records which continued to use regnal years. The Vikrama Sarvat never became popular in Bengal, or Eastern India. After Mohamedan conquest, Bengal was left without an era. For official purposes, Hejira was used, but the learned men used the śaka era, and the common people in certain parts used a rough reckoning, called Parganati-dbda, reckoned from the time of disappearance of Hindu rule.

After the introduction of Tarikh Ilahi, the people of Bengal began to use the Sarya Siddhanta reckoning, and the solar year. The Bengali San had thus a bybrid origin; to find the current year of the Bengali San, we take Hejira year elasped in 1556, i.e., 963 and add to it the number of solar years. Thus 1954 A. D. is 963 A.D.+(1954-1556)=1361 of Bengali San.

#### Other hybrid eras
A number of other hybrid eras formed in a similar way to Bengali San is mentioned in the table (No. 27): Amli and Vilayati in Bengal and Orissa, the various Fasli or harvest years in Bengal, Deccan, and Bombay.

All the other eras mentioned as hybrid in the chart were formed in a similar way, and the slight differences are due to mistakes in calculation, or differences in the time of introduction. While the Bengali San bas Mesadi as year-beginning others have taken the year-beginning to be coincident with some important mythical event of local provenance, e.g.) the year-beginning of the Amli era used in Orissa, viz., the 12th lunar day of the light half of the month of Bhadra is said to represent the birth date of king Indradyumna, the mythical king who is said to have discovered the site of modern Puri. The great temple of Puri was actually built by king Anyanka Bhim Dev of the Ganga dynasty about 1119 A.D., and kings of this dynasty who held sway in Orissa from 1035-1400 A. D. used the Ganga era.

The Kollam era prevalent in the Malayalam countries is of obscure origin. The year of this era is known as the Kollam Andu. The era is also called the Era of Paraburāma, and is said to have omitted thousands from their previous reckonings. In South Malabar it begins with the solar month Simha and in North Malabar with the solar month Kanya. The era started from 825 A.D.

#### The Jovian cycle
In Southern India the years are named after the name of the Jovian year and so it also serves the purpose of an era of a short period, vix., 60 years, after which the years recur. Details about Jovian years will be found in Appendix 5-E.
