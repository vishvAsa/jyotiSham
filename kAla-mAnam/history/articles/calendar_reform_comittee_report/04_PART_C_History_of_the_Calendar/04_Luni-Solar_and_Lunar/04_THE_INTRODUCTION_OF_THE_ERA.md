## Early eras 
For accurate date-recording, we require besides the month and the day, also a continuously running era. But the era came rather late in human history. We find dated records of kings in **Babylon** from about 1700 B.C. (Kassite kings). They used **regnal years**, lunar months, and the day of the lunar month. The **ancient Egyptian** records do not use any era, but sometimes the **regnal years**. But the use of regnal years is very inconvenient for purposes of exact chronology, because one has to locate the beginning of the reign of the king on the time-scale which often proves to be an extremely difficult problem, e.g., in India, Emperor **Asoka used regnal years**, but it is a problem of nearly hundred years for archaeologists to find out the exact date of the commencement of his reign. This varies from 273 B.C. to 264 B.C. 

In the writings of the Greek astronomers Hipparchos (140 B.C.) and Ptolemy (150 A.D.), we come across an era purporting to date from the time of one king **Nabu Nazir of Babylon** (747 B.C.), who is known to history, though this era is not used in records of the Babylonian kings themselves. 

The inference has been made, though without clear proof, that the Babylonian or rather Chaldean astronomers who were the earliest systematic observers of the heavenly bodies, get tired of the use of the regnal years, and felt the need of a continuously running era for precision in time-reckoning. They took advantage of a **unique gathering of planets about Feb. 26, 747 B.C. when Nabu Nazir was reigning** in Babylon to proclaim that the gods have ordained the 'introduction of a continuously running era' ( Sky and Telescope, Vol. I, p. 9, April, 1942). 

But the use of the Nabonassar era appears to have been confined to astronomers. The kings continued to record events in their regnal years as this had a great propaganda value for the royal family which they were unwilling to forego. It is now known that the other ancient eras, like that of the **Greek Olympiads (776 B.C.)** or the era of **Foundation of Rome (753 B.C.)** are **extrapolated eras**. The ancient Greek method of dating by Olympiads is of uncertain origin, but the system was critically examined by the Alexandrian chronologists, particularly Eratosthenes (3rd century B.C.), the founder of scientific chronology. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, Greek chronology is not reliable till the 50th Olympiad (i.e. 576 B.C.). The era was therefore invented a long time after its alleged year of starting. The era of the Foundation of Rome had a similar history (see Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, Chronology). The starting years of these eras are **suspiciously close to that of the Nabonassar era (747 B.C.)**. Probably both these eras were plagiarized from the era of Nabonassar after the savants of ancient Greece and Rome acquired the time-sense.

It is noteworthy that Hipparchos and Ptolemy used neither the era of Olympiads nor the era of Foundation of Rome, nor Greek or Chaldean months which were lunar, but the Nabonassar era and the more con venient Egyptian solar months. They preferred science to nationalistic chauvinis. 

## The Seleucidean and other derived Eras 
The Seleucidean Era (the S. E. era) : The first continuously running era which ran into general circulation is that introduced to commemorate the foundation of Seleucus's dynasty and dates from the year when Seleucus occupied the city of Babylon after defeating his rivals. There were two methods of counting, differing in the initial year and the first day of the year. 

According to the official (Macedonian) reckoning, the era started from the lunar month of Dios (near autumnal equinox) in the year (-311) A.D. or 312 B.C. The months had Macedonian names. 

According to the native Babylonian reckoning, the era started from the lunar month of Nisan (near vernal equinox) six months later than the starting of the Macedonian year. The months had Chaldean names, as given in Table No. 4. 

The Seleucid monarchs ruled over a vast empire from Syria to the borders of Afghanistan from 311 B.C. to 65 B.C. 8.e., nearly for 250 years and under their rule, the knowledge of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy and time-calculations spread far and wide, ultimately reaching India, and profoundly modifying the indigenous system in India. The use of Macedonian months spread over all these countries, as is apparent from contemporary inscriptions and coin-datings mentioned in § 5.5. The months were amānta, i.e., started after the new-noon was completed and were pegged on to the solar year which started on the day of the vernal equinox. The Nisan was the first lunar month after the vernal equinox. There were **7 intercalary months in a period of 19 years**. The correspondence between Chaldean and Greek months and the position of the intercalary months have been worked out by Prof. Pannekoek between the years 134-247 of the Seleucidean era, as already given (vide § 3.2 and 3.3) along with their Indian equivalent lunar months.
