<li>Shri K. D. Malaviya, Deputy Minister, Natural Resources and Scientific Research, Government of India, inaugurated the first meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee. Shri Malaviya said :</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;It is my very pleasant duty to extend to the Members of the Calendar Reform Committee a hearty welcome on behalf of the Government of India.</p>
<p>You are meeting here this morning not for any academic discussion on a subject of scientific interest, but for giving a practical lead to the country on a very important task, that is, of bringing about a uniformity in the Indian Calendar. You know how fundamentally important is the concept of calendar for our civilized life, for without a calendar no country can get on with its day-to-day work.</p>
<p>The concept of month and year starts from accepting day as the unit. I learn that the Indian astronomers of the Siddhāntic period. 400 A.D. to 1200 A.D., were the first to invent the idea of Ahargaṇa or heap of days for time reckonings. This device was introduced into European astronomy in 1582 A.D. by Joseph Scaliger. At the same time it is said by the modern astronomers that a critical review of the Vedāṅga Jyōtiṣa calendar shows that purely Indian systems of time reckoning up to the early centuries of the Christian era were very crude compared to the contemporary Graeco-Chaldean time reckonings of the Near East.</p>
<p>It is rather strange to find that while most of Christendom, in spite of diversity of race and country, follows one single calendar which has become the world calendar, while all the Islamic countries follow also a single calendar, the different States and provinces of India have followed and are following not loss than 30 different calendars differing in the era beginning, the initial date of the year, and to some extent in the methods of calculation. Though these calendars are used for social purposes, and for fixing up the religious holidays, their very diversity causes a great deal of inconvenience to the public and the State. The same holiday may be observed in different parts of the country and even in the same locality at intervals of one day according to the method of calculations. In some cases, as for example, in the case of the Car Festival of Puri, the days in the Bengal and Orissa calendars have sometimes differed by as much as month. Why is it so? I understand that calendars were put on a scientific basis about 1,500 years ago : the rules laid down by our astronomers were based on scientific knowledge as then known and they always took the precaution of laying down the rule for the coming generations that they should always correct their calculations by means of exact observations of the sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies, which serve as time-keepers.</p>
<p>Up to 1200 A.D., before India passed under foreign invaders, our astronomers at Ujjain and other centres, always took the trouble of correcting their calculations from direct observations of the heavenly bodies. But, after 1200 A.D., the indigenous centres of astronomical study were all broken up, and the new rulers did not take the trouble of setting up fresh centres till towards the end of the Moghul rule, when Maharja Jai Singh of Amber established five observatories at Ujjain, Jaipur and other centres for astronomical studies after the pattern of the famous observatory of Ulugh Begh at Samarkand. Our calendar-makers, being for long left to their own resources, and having no astronomical observatories had to fall back for calculations on rules which were insufficient and incorrect and which vitiated all the results. Therefore, confusion crept in the calendars, and they have become diversified according to local usage and customs. This condition is representative of 800 years of suppression, and is symbolic of the history of India.</p>
<p>Now that we are an independent nation and are making all efforts to bring about integration in our national life, it is obvious that an important item like the calendar cannot be left in the present confused state. We use for civil and administrative purposes the Gregorian Calendar which has been imposed by the British Rulers. This calendar is not their invention but like the Roman script, it was imposed on them by their Roman civilisers who got it partly from Egypt. On account of the dominance of the Christian powers during the last two centuries, it has become the World Calendar. But on principle it is a very inconvenient and unscientific calendar compared to ours, and needs reform.</p>
<p>There is a proposal before the U.N.O. by the World Calendar Association for the revision of the Gregorian calendar. One of the tasks of the present Committee would be to make suggestions to this world-body for the evolution of a world calendar which will be scientific and can command the consent of all nations. Our Mohammedan fellow citizens will continue to use the Hedjira calendar for fixing their religious holidays and we leave them there. The labours of the present Calendar Committee is to make a scientific study of all the calendars of indigenous origin, and make suggestions for a unified calendar for the guidance of administration, for social purposes, and as far as practicable, for fixing up the religious holidays for India. I am assured by my astronomical friends assembled here that this is quite possible. We shall be looking forward to your evolving a formula which would be acceptable to the different people and States of India, and the Government of India will give serious considerations to the adoption of your proposals. I need hardly add that this should be based on science, should take due consideration of the customs and religious festivals in different parts of the country and at the same time would be a calendar which the different communities and States can adopt.</p>
<p>While making those suggestions before you I am aware of the difficulties. Calendar reform can be suggested by scientists, but it can be carried into practice only by those who have religious or political authority. The ancient Roman calendar could be reformed only by a dictator like Julius Caesar, and later on by the religious dictator of Christendom, Pope Gregory XIII, and the ancient luni-solar calendar only by the authority of the Prophet. But we are now under a democracy. Whatever proposals you may make would have to be submitted to the public for their opinion, and I am quite sure that our public would not resent any innovation simply because it is a new thing, just as they do not reject electricity or new machines. I hope the public response would be encouraging and the Government would find it possible to give serious consideration to your proposals.&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<p>Prof. M. N. Saha, the Chairman, on behalf of the members of the Committee, expressed grateful thanks to the Prime Minister for his kind message. The Committee regretted that the Prime Minister could not personally inaugurate the deliberations of the Committee. Prof. Saha, however, assured the Committee that the Prime Minister had his heart and soul in the matter, and that he wanted the Committee to get on with its work and evolve scientific proposals for preparation of a uniform calendar for the whole of India and for the benefit of the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chairman on behalf of the Committee, gratefully thanked the Deputy Minister for having graced the occasion by his presence and having inaugurated the work of the Committee. The Deputy Minister had laid down the lines on which the Committee may proceed. With the encouragement of the Government, the Committee hoped to be able to accomplish the desired objective, for without State support the discussions would be dead letter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="current-mess">Current mess</h3>
<ol start="7">
<li>The Chairman pointed out that in India there were 30 or more different calendars. In Banaras alone they had four calendars and it was quite common that important Hindu festivals like Ganeśa Caturthī and Sarasvatī Pūjā were celebrated on different days in different parts of the country or even at the same city as happened this year at Calcutta. The Committee should aim at placing before the Government proposals for a uniform scientific calendar which would be acceptable to all. The task was not an easy matter.</li>

The Indian luni-solar calendar up to 400 A.D. was very crude, but great astronomers of India after 400 A.D. in Pataliputra, Bhilmal in Rajasthan and in Ujjain particularly had made very great contributions to mathematical knowledge, to astronomy and to other branches of science. They laid down the formulæ for the future generations and advised them to get their calculations verified by means of observations of the sun, the moon and the planets, which are our time-makers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the present moment, the <strong>Ahargaṇa</strong> or the heap of days is in usage for accurate chronological calculations. The idea was first evolved by Hindu astronomers about 400 A.D. This was invented only in the 16th century in Europe by Joseph Scaliger. The Siddhantic astronomers started the year from the day after the <strong>Vernal Equinox</strong> but the older tradition was, as many Indian savants had pointed out, to begin the calendar from <strong>Winter Solstice</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solar months which were invented about these times had not proved very convenient for use. The month-lengths varied from 29 to 32. The <strong>greatest difficulty</strong> has been caused by the use of the <strong>sidereal year and not the year of seasons</strong>, as the Hindu savants of those times either were unaware of the existence of the <strong>phenomenon of precession</strong> of equinoxes, or thought it was not unidirectional. The mistake was found by <strong>Munjāla and śrīpati</strong> in the <strong>10th and 11th</strong> centuries, when the Vernal Equinox had receded by seven to eight days, and they tried to persuade the astronomers to take to sāyana reckoning but the attempt was unsuccessful. The situation now is that the Vernal Equinox falls on 21st March but our year beginning which ought to fall on the following day, falls, actually on 13th or 14th April. Thus a mistake of 23 days had occurred in our calculation of seasons, or year-beginning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chairman pointed out that it was for the Committee to discuss and <strong>decide whether the year was to be brought back by 23 days or to leave the mistake</strong> as it was and to retain a permanent constant error. He also pointed out that such a mistake had occurred in Europe and corrections had to be introduced. The Gregorian year in 1582 was found to have an error of 10 days. Pope Gregory XIII advised that the 5th October should be called the 15th October. This was adopted by the Catholics. Though the Protestant countries at first did not accept this move, simply because it came from the Pope, but 170 years later England had to accept the correction by legislation. Russia accepted the Gregorian calendar only after the Bolshevik resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In India, the idea of Indian Calendar reform originated from Maharashtra Lokamanya Shri <strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</strong> well-known as a great political figure of the last generation was, as is well-known, a great savant and antiquarian and initiated calendar reform in Maharashtra. He started a new reformed calendar which is still being published at Poona.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The great pioneer of calendar-studies was <strong>Sankara Balakrishna Dixit</strong>, whose history of <strong>Bharatīya Jyotiṣa-śāstra</strong> is a standard authoritative work, but his work is in Marathi and unaccessible to majority of India. The Chairman expressed the hope that it should be translated into English for the use of all.*</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>* The Council of Scientific anda Industrial Research has since made arrangements for having the book translated into English and Prof. R. V. Vaidya, a member of the Committee has been entrusted with the work.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>
<p>In Bengal, <strong>Mādhab Chandra Chaṭṭopadhaya</strong> had been publishing the Viśuddha Siddhānta Panjikā since 1890, in which all calculations were made according to modern accepted formulæ. Shri Nirmal Chandra Lahiri, a member of the Committee, has been continuing the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The problem of Indian Calendar Reform was also seriously examined at Banaras, the ancient seat of Indian culture and religion by the late Pandit <strong>Madan Mohan Malaviya</strong>, Shri <strong>Sampurnanand</strong> and others and the need for rectification of the present position was impressed upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, the idea of calendar reform had been going on for a long time in this country on a personal level. But as it affected all classes of people, effective reform can be carried out only on <strong>State level</strong>. But all were agreed that there should be a uniform national calendar for the whole of India.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All our religious festivals are determined according to the <strong>lunar calendar which is pegged on to the present unsatisfactory solar calendar</strong>. Hence the task before the Committee is to <strong>devise a satisfactory solar calendar first</strong> and peg on to it a lunar calendar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gregorian-drawbacks">Gregorian drawbacks</h2>
<ol start="18">
<li>The Chairman pointed out that there was a good deal of dissatisfaction even with the Gregorian calendar, though it has attained the status of a world calendar. One of the main drawbacks of this calendar is that the ending of the year <strong>does not correspond with</strong> the <strong>winter solstice</strong> day.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several <strong>proposals</strong> for reforming the Gregorian calendar. According to one proposal, <strong>every month was to be of 4 weeks</strong>, and therefore of 28 days and <strong>thirteen months</strong> would make a year of 364 days. One day, the year-end day, was to be without any name and named simply the <strong>year-end day</strong>. In leap years, there was to be an additional <strong>year-middle day</strong>, without any weekday name. Every month was to begin on a Sunday.</p>
<p>According to the other proposal the year was to consist of <strong>4 quarters, each of 91 days</strong>. Each quarter was to be divided into <strong>three months of 31, 30, 30 days</strong>. The year-end day, and the year-middle day in leap years were to be the same as before.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>The World Calendar Association of New York, U.S.A., had a proposal before the United Nations Organization to evolve a uniform calendar for the whole world. Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the Astronomer-Royal of U.K. and other eminent astronomers had expressed their support of the proposals of W.C.A. They wanted to effect this change from 1956. This proposal, if accepted, would produce great convenience and simplicity but succession of day reckoning by. the cycle of the seven day week will have to be given up.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="proposals">Proposals</h2>
<ol start="20">
<li>The Committee had to discuss all these matters, and its function was to submit proposals to the Government of India and devise ways and means of achieving the desired scientific calendar. The Chairman said that the Committee could count upon the sympathy of the Hon&rsquo;ble the Prime Minister and the Deputy Minister and of the Government of India. The proposals to be discussed are :&ndash;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) Whether a number of astronomical computers would have to be appointed for compiling an All-India Calendar for five years in advance on the lines which will be suggested by the Committee.</li>
<li>(b) Whether steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephemeris for the use of the calendar-makers, the Navy and the Air Force.</li>
<li>(c) Establishment of a Central Astronomical Observatory by the Government equipped with modern instruments and apparatus.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="21">
<li>
<p>The Chairman said that modern apparatus like the ammonia clock, the quartz clock should be installed in the observatory for the betterment of the time-service and for geophysical studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chairman said that geophysical studies with the aid of accurate clocks was of very great fundamental importance. All along scientists had studied only the surface of the earth. But now the study of the interior of the earth has attained great significance and with the aid of accurate clocks, it has been found that the period of rotation of the earth undergoes sudden variations which may be due to something going on inside the earth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="more-motivation">More motivation</h2>
<ol start="23">
<li>
<p>The Chairman emphasized that a reformed calendar and an Indian Ephemeris will be of advantage not only for civil, social and national life but will also be of great use for the army, the navy and the air force. He thanked the Hon&rsquo;ble Deputy Minister on behalf of the Committee. (At this stage the Deputy Minister left the meeting.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chairman informed the Committee that he had received a number of good wishes for the deliberations of the Committee from not only India but also from several European countries as well as from Brazil, Canada, etc. The President of the W.C.A. Miss Achelis, had also sent her goodwill message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general question as to whether or not Government of India should undertake reform of the various Hindu calendars in India and have one uniform calendar for the whole of India was discussed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>Dr. Gorakh Prasad said that it will be in the fitness of things for the Government to initiate the reform and pointed out that only minimum necessary changes in the prevailing custom should be effected to avoid public resentment and opposition. He emphasized this point. He also pointed out that in the past there had been hero worship and guru-worship and due to personal animosity and financial considerations several anomalies have crept in. Even today pañcāṅga making was a financial proposition. Astrology flourished on the principle “Remember it if it fits and forget it if it misses.&quot;</p>
<p>Shri Lahiri said that proposals concerning religious festivals should be got ratified by eminent Pandits.</p>
<p>Prof. Vaidya said that as we have got a democracy, Government of the people and by the people, Government should undertake the reform.</p>
<p>Dr. Daftari pointed out, however, that the Committee had been definitely assigned the task of submitting proposals to the Government for a reform in the calendar and as such the general question whether the Government should undertake it or not did not arise. He laid emphasis on the fact that our present calendars were absurd in the sense that the seasons were moving backward and wanted that this should be stopped.</p>
<p>The Committee <strong>resolved that a National Solar Calendar for civil purposes</strong> should be prepared by the Committee under the auspices of the Central Government and that <strong>the lunar pañcāṅga should be pegged on to this</strong> calendar.</p>
<h2 id="world-calendar-reform">World calendar reform</h2>
<ol start="26">
<li>Whether India should support the proposals of the W.C.A. was discussed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Gorakh Prasad was not in favour. Shri Karandikar opined that India should evolve a National Calendar and the whole world may follow it.</p>
<p>Discussion on this point was postponed ; the Committee did not favour the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposal of World Calendar Reform sponsored by the Government of India, is now under the active consideration of the ECOSOC of the United Nations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sāyana-or-nirayana-reckoning">Sāyana or Nirayana Reckoning.</h2>
<ol start="27">
<li>The Chairman pointed out that the sāyana year was 365.2422 days and the Gregorian year was
365*2425 days. Thus the error in adopting the Gregorian leap year system would be only 1 day in 3300 years. He favoured the adoption of the sāyana reckoning. The Committee agreed with the Chairman and resolved to adopt the sāyana reckoning for the reformed calendar.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the members of the Committee agreed to the resolution except Dr. Gorakh Prasad who recorded his disagreement with the resolution. Dr. Gorakh Prasad was of the opinion that for civil purposes also the year should begin on the same day as for religious purposes. He thought that the existence of two Indian solar years would create confusion instead of producing any beneficial effects.</p>
<h2 id="28-beginning-of-the-year">28. Beginning of the Year.</h2>
<p>The Chairman pointed out that there was an error of 23 days in the present calendars and desired to know whether the Committee would favour shifting of the year for the reformed calendar by 23 days to put an end to this mistake.</p>
<p>Dr. Gorakh Prasad pointed out that a suggestion to shift the year back by 23 days would meet with very great opposition from the public who will certainly resent such a move. He was not in favour of the shift.</p>
<p>Dr. Daftari opined that this error of 23 days can be left over as it was and allowed to remain as a permanent constant error. The increase of the error should be stopped.</p>
<p>Shri Karandikar said that the Government should have a solar year beginning from Vernal Equinox. He desired the length of the year to be tropical. He suggested that after shifting back by 23 days the V. E. day, viz., 21st March may be the beginning of the solar year, but the pañcāṅgas may start the lunar year from Caitra suklādi.</p>
<h2 id="29-vernal-equinox--winter-solstice">29. Vernal Equinox &amp; Winter Solstice.</h2>
<p>The Chairman said that V.E. was on 21st March and that W.S. was on 22nd December. The problem was whether the Committee favoured V.E. or W.S. as the beginning of the solar year,</p>
<p>Dr. Daftari said that W.S. is good for the civil calendar. In any case, the seven-day week should not be touched which was agreed to by the Committee. Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Prof. Vaidya and Shri Lahiri favoured the V.E. as the commencement for the solar year.</p>
<h2 id="30-length-of-the-months">30. Length of the Months.</h2>
<p>Shri Karandikar&rsquo;s view was that the time taken by the sun to go through 30° on the zodiac should be the length of the month. The Chairman pointed out that the lengths of months would vary from 29 to 32, and would cause much inconvenience.</p>
<p>The Committee agreed to have 5 solar months of 31 days and 7 months of 30 days in an ordinary year and in a leap year 6 solar months of 31 days and six months of 30 days.</p>
<h2 id="31-era">31. Era.</h2>
<p>The Chairman pointed out that the Vikrama era was never used by astronomers and in different States, there were different year beginnings for the Vikrama Samvat era. For all calculations the Indian astronomers have always used the śaka era.</p>
<p>Dr. Daftari said that the Siddhāntas used the Kaliyuga era. Sri Karandikar was of the opinion that either Kali or Kalpa era should be used.</p>
<p>The Committee resolved that the current śaka Era should be adopted for the reformed Indian calendar.</p>
<h2 id="32-reckoning-of-day">32. Reckoning of Day:</h2>
<p>Two systems now prevalent are</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) reckoning the day from mid-night to mid-night and</li>
<li>(b) from sun-rise to sun-rise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chairman favoured the mid-night system as the advantages in this system were :</p>
<p>(i) that the astronomers all over the world, including our ancient astronomers used it ; (ii) it was an international system ; (iii) complications due to latitude did not come in this system.</p>
<p>Dr. Daftari, Shri Karandikar, Prof. Vaidya and Dr. Gorakh Prasad, however, were in favour of reckoning the day from sun-rise to sun-rise ; even though latitude and longitude had to be considered in calculations. Shri Lahiri was in favour of reckoning the day from mid-night to mid-night.</p>
<p>The Committee resolved that in the Indian system of time reckoning, the day should be reckoned from mid-night to mid-night at an All-India Central Station for dating purposes only, but for religious and other purposes the day may begin from sun-rise of the Central Station ; but tables showing local sun - rise for important stations should be given.</p>
<h2 id="33-all-india-central-station">33. All-India Central Station.</h2>
<p>The Chairman pointed out that it was necessary for international purposes that Indian time should be 51 hrs. ahead of the Universal Time (Greenwich Time). The Committee considered the question of location of the Central Astronomical Station.</p>
<p>Prof. Vaidya and Shri Karandikar put up maps and atlases. Prof. Vaidya proposed Ujjain on traditional grounds or Jubbalpore on geographical grounds. Dr. Gorakh Prasad and Shri Karandikar suggested Ujjain, while Shri Lahiri suggested 224°N. Latitude. It was decided that a place (821°E. of Greenwich) and having the latitude of Ujjain (viz. 23° 11&rsquo;N) be recognised as the Central Station for India.</p>
<h2 id="34-lunar-calendar">34. Lunar Calendar.</h2>
<p>The Committee agreed that the lunar months should be new-moon ending, and the lunar year should begin with Caitra śukla-pratipat.</p>
<p>The following resolution was adopted :</p>
<p>The Committee recommends to the Government of India that a scientific Civil Solar Calendar to be henceforth called the National Calendar for purposes of dating should have its first day after the Vernal Equinox day, viz., on the 22nd March, but for religious purposes in places where solar calendar is used, 13th or 14th April may be the first day of the year for some time to come (as a concession to the prevailing custom).</p>
<h2 id="35-the-year-for-religious-calendar">35. The year for Religious Calendar.</h2>
<p>Dr. Daftari said that for the sake of convenience the first point of the zodiac should be 23° 21&rsquo; ahead of the real Vernal Equinox, and that all calculations should be made on this basis. Shri Lahiri pointed out that in Bengal they had 23° 12'.</p>
<p>It was decided that the first point of Meṣa is to be taken 23° 15&rsquo; ahead of the Vernal Equinoctial point, and all calculations should be made on that basis.</p>
<h2 id="36-names-of-solar-months">36. Names of Solar Months.</h2>
<p>The names of the months should continue to be Caitra, Vaiśākha, etc., as at present ; the appellation of solar or lunar should be attached to them as the case may be.</p>
<p>The point regarding naming of the months of the National Civil Calendar was postponed for the next meeting.</p>
<h2 id="37-tithi">37. Tithi.</h2>
<p>The Chairman said that tithi calculations according to Indian method were wrong at present by sometimes as much as 6 hours and said that the Committee should favour a uniform tithi for the whole of India. Shri Karandikar however opposed the proposition and pointed out that the tithi depended on sunrise and so on local time and could never be uniform for the whole of India.</p>
<p>It was resolved that in the National Calendar, tithi should be given for the Central Station and the calculations of time should be given in hours and minutes.</p>
<h2 id="38-nakshatra">38. Nakshatra.</h2>
<p>The Chairman preferred an Indian calendar without nakṣatras being indicated. Dr. Daftari however said that the nakṣatras should be specified and that aśvinī should start with Meṣa. It was resolved that the nakṣatras should be given with Asvinī starting with Mesa.</p>
<h2 id="39-recommendations-to-the-government-of-india">39. Recommendations to the Government of India.</h2>
<p>Resolutions proposed by the Chairman and un animously passed by the Committee :&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A tentative National Calendar for the whole of India should be prepared for five years in advance, showing dates, days, months, tithis and nakṣatras. (Five years in advance was necessary to find out the practical implications and difficulties which may be caused by the occurrence of leap years and intercalary months.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephemeris by the Government of India showing in advance positions of the Sun, the Moon, the planets and other important heavenly bodies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>There should be a National Observatory at a suitable place provided with modern equipment, apparatus and time-service.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meeting-the-next-day">Meeting the next day</h2>

<p>The Committee reviewed the items covered in the meeting held on Saturday.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Some members of the Committee suggested that additional members should be taken up on the Committee or co-opted. The Chairman said that, if necessary, additional members would be taken up or co-opted, but only at a later stage, after the proceedings are reported to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussing the procedure to be followed, the Chairman said that the Committee should request the Government of India to appoint two astronomers to prepare the National Calendar on the lines suggested by the Committee and give them the necessary assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chairman is in correspondence with the Astronomer Royal of England regarding the compilation of the Indian Ephemeris.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Chairman proposed to the Committee that Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya may be recommended to the Government to be appointed for the work of compilation of the National Calendar. :</li>
</ol>
<p>The Committee recommended that the services of Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya who were both Government servants be got on loan for a period of one year in the first instance. The Committee also recommended that two assistants be appointed to assist Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya at Calcutta and Ujjain respectively.</p>
<p>The Committee recommended that suitable budget provision be made for one year for the work.*</p>
<ul>
<li>The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research had made budget grant for implementation of this recommendation and staff of calculators had been appointed.</li>
