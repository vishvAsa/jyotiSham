+++



The lunar calendar depends on the correct calculation of the moments of conjunction (Amāvasyā), opposition (Paurnamāsi) and of the tithis (i.e., the moments when the moon gains 12° or its integral multiple on the sun). The Indian calendar-makers use for this purpose the formulæ on lunar motion given in the three Siddhāntas. But as these are known to be inaccurate, they use certain corrections called bīja introduced by later Indian astronomers. 



It is now well-known that the motion of the moon is very irregular and complex, and therefore the moon is very inconvenient as a time-marker. For this reason the moon was completely discarded by the Egyptians as a time-marker 3000 years before Christ. The ancient Egyptian solar calendar is the basis from which the present Gregorian calendar has sprung. 



But other ancient and modern nations did not follow the Egyptians, and it became the chief duty on the part of their astronomers to observe the moon from day to day, and evolve mathematical formula from which the ephemerides of the moon could be calculated. As Neugebauer has shown (Exact Sciences in Antiquity), ancient Babylonian astronomy (700 B.C. 300 B.C.) was largely centred round devising, , from actual observations of the moon's position, mathematical formulæ, which would enable them to calculate the longitude of the moon in advance. These attempts were continued by the Greeks, Indians, Arabs and medieval Europeans and are still being continued. For the calculation of the moon's position, formulæ are employed which require' twenty pages of printed matter, containing about 1,500 terms in all. They have been evolved as measurements have become more refined and accurate, with the progress of astronomy ; and were, of course, unknown to astronomers of ancient times.
