These practices often produce a bewildering confusion in fixing up dates and moments of observance of the religious festivals, of which some detailed examples are given later. The Calendar Reform Committee was asked to make a study of the various Hindu religious calendars, and recommend to the Government a Unified National Calendar for Hindu religious purposes for the whole of India. The Committee has now finished its labours, and presents its report to the Government. The main points are summarized below: 



## Basic principles

The Hindu religious calendar is mainly **luni-solar**, i.e., the **seasons** are fixed by the **solar calendar**, while the **dates and moments** are fixed according to the **lunar calendar** pegged on to it. 



The calendar therefore depends on the science of astronomy which has evolved methods for correctly predicting the positions of the sun, the moon, and the planets (the Ephemerides). The astronomical part of the calculations should be the same for calendars used by all nations. But this is not the whole story ; for the calendar also depends on convention, which varies widely from country to country and from state to state. 



Let us give some idea of the Science as well as of the Conventions in use for the solar and the lunar calendars respectively. For the solar calendar : 



- (1) The year should be properly defined, and the year-length taken should be astronomically correct. 

- (2) The seasons should be properly defined, and should start on proper dates. 

- (3) The day should start from midnight. 



## Surya Siddhānta- goals and problems

An examination of Chap. XIV of the Surya Siddhānta (vide C§ 5.6) shows that the author of this famous treatise accepted these principles and laid down the following rules for the compilation of a calendar : 



- (1) The year should start from the instant when the sun crosses the vernal equinoctial point and the length of the year should therefore be tropical (sāyana). 

- (2) The seasons should consist of two solar months, each defined by the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the sun's path (the ecliptic). 

- (3) The day should be from midnight (ardharātraka system) for purposes of astronomical calculations. 



These principles do not alone suffice to define the calendar, for the year does not consist of a whole number of days, but its length (length of the tropical year) is approximately 365.2422 mean solar days. The time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the arc of the ecliptic varies from 29.44 days to 31.46 days. 



The Calendar Committee has tried to rectify this fundamental error, by recommending, as laid down by the Sūrya Siddhānta, that the year should begin on the day after the vernal equinox, and the year-length should be sāyana. 



For civil purposes, both the year and the month should consist of a whole number of days, and the civil day ( sāvana ), according to Hindu religious practices, should start from sunrise. To achieve these purposes, different conventions have been used in different states which account partly for calendar confusion ( vide C 85:6). 



But the most serious mistake has been in the length of the year taken by the Sūrya Siddhānta, a standard astronomical compilation having its beginning from the 4th century A.D. The year-length adopted is 365.25876 days, which is presumably sidereal, but even then the length is wrong by + 0.00240 days. But as is pointed out in C § 56, the Sūrya Siddhānta lays down definitely that the year-length should be tropical which, according to modern measurements, should have approximately 365.2422 days, but this rule has been misinterpreted. 



The mistakes in astronomical constants (e.g., in the fixing up of the length of the year or months) are common in all ancient astronomical treatises, whether Indian or occidental, but in the West, the correct values were obtained later by refined observations during medieval times and were then adopted for calendar calculations by edicts of dictators like Julius Caesar or Pope Gregory XIII on the advice of astronomers. In India, astronomical observations stopped from about 1200 A.D. after the advent of the Turkish invaders, when Indian observatories were either destroyed or abandoned by the astronomers and calendar making fell into the hands of astrologers, who had to depend on ancient treatises. 



But a far more potent cause for the adherence to the wrong value was the failure, on the part of the Indian astronomers, to grasp the real nature of the phenomenon of Precession of Equinoxes (vide C § 4:10). In this, they were not alone, for the false notions about this phenomenon were not abandoned even in Europe till the advent of Newton (1687). 



The Indian year is thus longer than the tropical year by 0.01656 days, and this error has been accumulating for nearly 1400 years with the result that the solar year, instead of starting on the day following the vernal equinox (21st March) as it did in the time of Varahamihira starts nearly 23-24 days later. Thus the year beginning as laid down by our almanac-makers has lost all connection with the actual year-beginning (the day following the vernal equinoctial day) as contemplated by the Sūrya Siddhānta, and the festivals as given by the Indian almanacs are being celebrated very frequently in wrong seasons. If Sarat Pūrimā is celebrated in the Hemanta season, as would happen in the year 1955, it is obvious that our almanacs are following neither the Scriptures nor Science.
