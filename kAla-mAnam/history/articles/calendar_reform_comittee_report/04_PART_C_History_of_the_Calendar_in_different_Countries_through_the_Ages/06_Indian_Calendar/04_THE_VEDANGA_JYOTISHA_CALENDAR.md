+++

## Intro
The history of the Indian calendar from the end of the Yajurveda period to the beginning of the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period is very imperfectly known though there are plenty of calendaric references in the Brāhmanās, Sūtras, and the epic Mahābhārata and various literature. On time-scale, it extends from an unknown antiquity, which is set by some at 1300 B.C. to 900 A.D. 

The **Vedānga Jyōtiṣa** is generally assigned to this period. It may be said to be a sort of collection of short aphorisms giving mathematical rules for fixing the calendar in advance, and is known in three versions : the Rg-Jyotiṣa consisting of 36 verses, attached to the Rg-Veda and ascribed to one Lagadha as mentioned earlier, the Yājuṣ Jyotiṣa attached to the Yajurveda and consisting of 43 verses, and there is a text ascribed to one Somakara, a commentator of unknown age of the Vedas. The dffferent texts contain about the same matter, but the verses are haphazardly arranged showing that the original texts have not come down to us in an unadulterated form. The number of independent verses in all the versions is not more than 49, and some of the verses have not been interpreted. 

There are several other calendarical treatises which can be assigned to this period. The **Surya Prajñapti**, a Jaina astronomical work, the **Jyotiṣakaraṇḍa**, and the **Kālālokaprakaśa**. 

A short account of the calendaric rules followed in these treatises is given in Varāhamihira's Pañca Siddhāntika, Chap. XII, where the rules are collected as "**Paitāmaha Siddhānta**" or Astronomical Calendar according to Grandfather Brahma, the Creator, in Hindu mythology. That shows the high antiquity of the rules. **Varāhamihira, as well as Brahmagupta** describe the rules as very "inaccurate" (**Dūravibhraṣṭau**, furthest from truth in Varahamihira's language) though they pay a formal courtesy to the supposed authors. But such has been the case with calendars of all ancient nations, including the Babylonians at this period and a critical account of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa is important from the historical point of view. 

It may be remarked here that there are minor differences between Vedānga Jyotiṣa, the Jain systems, and the Paitāmaha Siddhānta, which appear to be the latest of this group. The older treatises have a year of 366 days, while the Paitamaha Siddhānta has a year of 365.3569 days (Dīkṣit). 

There is an extensive literature on Vedānga Jyōtiṣa which has been studied by Dr. G. Thibaut, S. B. Diksit, S. K. Pillai, and Dr. R. Shama Sastry, amongst others. We here give an account of the calendar according to the Paitāmaha Siddhānta. 

## Summary of the Contents 
### yuga
"**Five years** constitute a **Yuga** or Saros of the sun and the moon. The yuga comprises **1830 sāvana days** (civil days) and **1860 tithis** (lunar days). In the yuga, there are **62 +++(synodic)+++ lunar months** and **60 solar months**. So **two months are omitted** as intercalary months, in a period of 5 years. The number of omitted tithis in the period is 30. There are **67 nakṣatra-months** (sidereal months) in the yuga The moon passes through 67 x 27 = 1809 nakṣatras within this period. The **yuga begins at winter solstice** with the **sun, and the moon together at the Dhaniṣthā** asterism (α or β Delphini)." These are the main points from which the **five yearly calendar** can be constructed. 

The Vedānga Jyotisa further describes measure ments of the subdivisions of the day by means of the clepsydra, as well as by gnomon-shadows. One particular feature is the assumption that the ratio of the length of the day to that of the night on the summer solstice day is as 3:2. 

Let us now examine these points critically. 

### nakṣatra
We observe that all the mathematical rules point out only to mean motions of the sun and the moon, i.e, the periods of the sun and the moon were obtained by counting the number of sāvana days in a large number of years and months, and dividing the number by the number of periods (year or month). No evidence is found of the systematic day to day observations of the sun and the moon. Only the lunar zodiac was used for describing the positions of the sun and the moon, which appears to have been divided into 27 equal parts or nakṣatras ; in other words the nakṣatras no longer denoted star-clusters but equal divisions of the lunar belt. 

There is **no mention** of the zodiac or **twelve signs of the zodiac**, or of **week days**, or of **planetary motion**. 

## Luni-solar adjustment
Let us now look critically into the rules.

5 solar years = 365.2422 x 5 = 1826.2110 days; 62 synodic months = 29.53059 x 62 = 1830.8965 days ; 67 sidereal months = 27.32166 x 67 = 1830.5512 days. 

Therefore, regarded as a +++(naive)+++ measure for **luni-solar adjustment**, the **error is 4.685 days in a period of 5 years**, i.e., if we started a yuga with the sun and the moon together on the winter solstice day, the beginning of the next yuga (6th year) would occur 4.685 days later than the winter solstice and in 5 to 6 yugas the discrepancy would amount to a month or half season. This cannot escape notice, and therefore there must have been some way of bringing back the yuga to the winter solstice day. Otherwise the calendar becomes useless. But how could it have been done? This is a matter for conjecture and several hypotheses have been proposed. According to S. B. Dīkṣit, we should have in 95 years : 

- according to the V. J., 2/5 x 95 = 38 intercalary months, 
- while actually we have, 7/19 x 95 = 35 intercalary months. 

So the Vedānga Jyōtiṣa rules introduce 3 more intercalary months than necessary in 95 years, and if these are dropped, we can have good adjustment. This could have been done as follows : 

In the first period of 30 years 6 yugas, suppose they had 11 intercalary months instead of 12. 

The beginning of the yuga would go ahead of the winter solstice in 30 years by 4685 X6 = 28.110 days.  

But if we do not have the intercalary month on the 30th year, the yuga-beginning is brought back to 29.53–28.110 = 1.421 days before the W.S. day. The same process is repeated for the next period of 30 years. The yuga-beginning is thus brought back to 2.842 days before the W.S. day. 

The next period may be taken to consist of 35 years, i.e., 7 yugas each of five years, in which the yuga beginning goes ahead by 3.264 days. The combined result of the three periods of 30, 30, and 35 years is to put the yuga beginning ahead of the W.S. day by 0.422 days only. Other conjectural cycles are described by Dr. Shama Sastry. 

But was any such practice really followed ? We have no evidence from the verses ; but S. B. Diksit mentions that **intercalary months were inserted only when needed, and hence probably they were dropped when not needed**. +++(This conforms with analysis by sammodācārya kauṇḍinyāyana.)+++ 

## Tithis 
The main object of the Vedānga Jyōtiṣa calendar appears to have been the correct prediction of the tithi and nakṣatra on any sāvana (civil) day within the yuga. In this respect, the rules were more accurate. A tithi is defined as 1/30th of the lunar month. The correct measure is 1 tithi = 29.530588/30  =.984353 days,  while the measure taken = 61/62 = .983871 days. The mistake is .000482 days on the lower side or one tithi in 2075 days or in 5 2/3 years. 

The five yearly period consists of 1830 civil days in which there are 62 synodical months. 

We know 62 x 29.53059=1830.8965 days. Hence in order to make the tithi calculations correct, one day (exactly 0.8965 days) had to be added to the total number of civil days in the period. 

## Nakshatras 
The days were named according to the nakṣatras or lunar asterisms in which the moon was found, and a lot of crude astrology\* had grown up round this system. So it was necessary to predict the nakṣatra in advance. The Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar prescribed some methods for such predictions. 

\* Astrology based only on the sun and the moon. Later post Siddhāntic, astrology in India is largely Graeco-Chaldean, and makes use of the signs of the zodiac, and of planetary position and motion. 

In a five yearly period of 1830 days, the sidereal revolutions of the moon amounted to 67 in which there are 1809 nakṣatras. 

Actually 1 nakṣatra day=51.74100 =1.011913 days, while the measure taken 1880/1809 = 1.011608 days. 

The mistake was .000305 days on the lower side of 1 nakṣatra in 3279 days or about 9 years.

## The Time of the Vedānga Jyōtiṣa 
All recensions of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa contain the following verses : 

Svarākramete somārkau yadā sākam savāsavau  
Syāt tadādiyugaṁ māghastapaḥ śuklo'yanaṁ hyudak. (6)  
**Prapadyete śraviṣṭhādau sūryācandramasāv udak**  
Sārpārdhe dakṣiṇārkas tu māghasrāvanayoḥ sadā. (7) 

These two verses taken together yield the following: 

The winter solstice took place at the lunar asterism Śraviṣtha, which is later called Dhaniṣthā. 

This is the 21st nakṣatra in the Krttikādi system and 23rd in the Aśvinyādi system and its component stars are α, β, y and δ Delphini.\* +++(* On & Dhanisthå day the moon got conjoined with both the β and α Delphinis at interval of 2 hours.)+++ These stars are far away from the ecliptic. We have for 1950 : 

- α Delphini, Long. =316° 41', Lat. - +33° 2' 
- β, 315 39, +31 55
- γ, 318 40, +32 41
- δ, 318 35, +31 57 

The Arabs have β and ζ Aquarii which also. represent the Chinese Hsiu. 

It has been stated in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa that the **junction star of the asterism was placed at the beginning of the division** and it marked the **beginning of Uttarāyana** or the W.S. day. Thus the star representing the Dhaniṣthā division had 270° as the longitude at the time when the tradition of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar was formulated. If α Delphini is taken as the principal star of the asterism, then its longitude was 270° at the time of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa and in 1950, its longitude is 316° 41'. As the solstices take about 72 years to retrograde through one degree, the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa is found to be (316° 41'- 270°) ~ 72 = 46.07°x72=3362 years before 1950 A.D. or **1413 B.C.** The star ß Delphini, however, yields a somewhat lower period, i.e., about 1338 B.C. 

## The Plan of the Calendar 

In a period of 5 years, there are : 

- 1830 civil days, 
- 62 lunar months, and so 1860 tithis, 
- 67 sidereal months and so 1809 nakṣatras. 

As the period contains 60 solar months, there are 2 intercalary months which are placed after every 30 lunar months. Thus in the third year, the month śrāvaṇa is adhika which is followed by śuddha śrāvana ; and in the fifth year the last month is also adhika which is adhika Māgha. 

There are 1860 tithis while the number of civil days is 1830 ; so there are 30 omitted tithis (tithi kṣaya). Each period of 61 days contains 62 tithis, so one tithi is omitted after 61 civil days. From this consideration the number of civil days per month can be obtained and will be shown in the table below. The Vedānga Jyōtiṣa people regularly counted a tithi to a day, but after 61 days one tithi was omitted. 

As regards nakṣatras, their number is 1809 in 1830 civil days, the difference being 21. So 87 1/7 days were equivalent to 86 1/7 nakṣatras. They counted a nakṣatra to a day successively, but after every 87 days (actually 87 1/7 days), one nakṣatra was repeated for two days. 

The five different years of the period had distinctive names, viz., (1) Saṁvatsara, (2) Parivatsara, (3) Idavatsara, (4) Anuvatsara, and (5). Idvatsara. 

The plan of the five yearly calendar is shown below : 

Table 12. +++(Typical)+++ Number of days in each month of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa Calendar 

<div class="spreadsheet" src="../../../tables/vedanga_jyotiSha_5yr_calendar.csv" separator=","> </div>  

As already shown, the actual length of 62 lunar months is 1830.8965 days, while there are 1830 civil days in the five yearly period. It is therefore very likely that one civil day was added to the period when necessary to make it conform to the phases of the moon which were regularly observed. This additional day was no doubt placed at the end of the period, and when it was added the last month adhika Magha contained 30 days instead of 29 days which was otherwise its due. +++(Or, this is an artificial problem - adding adhika-mAsa-s only when needed solves the problem quite satisfactorily.)+++

## Solstice day length and latitude
The ratio 3/2 for the duration of the longest day to that of the shortest night given in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa was first noted by Dr. Thibaut. Later the same ratio was found by Father Kugler from Babylonian cunei form records of the Seleucidean period. The ratio is characteristic of a latitude of 35° N, which is nearly that of Babylon (for Babylon φ=32° 40'N). Hence it has been inferred that the Vedānga Jyotiṣa-astronomers got this ratio from Seleucidean Babylon. But it may be pointed out that the Vedic life centred round North-Western India, from the Sarasvatī valley (Kurukṣetra φ=29° 58') to Gāndhār (φ=31° 32'N). The ratios of the duration of daylight to, night on the summer-solstice day for different latitudes are as follows: 

Table 13. 

Longest day and shortest night (Calculated with obliquity of ecliptic as 23° 51' which is for 1300 B. C. The results for 500 B. C. are also almost the same.) 

<div class="spreadsheet" src="../../../tables/day_night_ratio_by_latitude.csv" separator=","> </div>  

It is seen from the above table, that even at the latitude of Babylon, the ratio is not 1.50 but: 1.45. At Gandhār, it is 1.42. The difference is not very large. But there is another factor to which attention must be drawn. 

Both Babylonians and Indians measured subdivisions of the day by means of some kind of Clepsydra. A description of the Clepsydra used by Indians during the Vedānga Jyōtiṣa-period will be found in S.B. Dīkṣit's Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra (Sec. II, Chap. I). But the day length must have been measured from the observed time of sunrise to the observed time of sunset. This is somewhat larger than the astronomical time of sunrise on account of refraction. Assuming that the effect of **refraction is to elevate a celestial body near the horizon by about 35'**, and the **sun's semi-diameter is about 16'**, the **sun's upper limb appears on the horizon at a place on 32° latitude, about 4.5 minutes before the centre** of the sun is due on the horizon. For the same reason, the **sunset takes place 4.5 minutes** after the astronomical calculated sunget. So the **apparent length of the day is increased** bg 2* 4.5 min. or by **9 minutes**. Therefore for the latitude of Babylon we have the length of maximum day-light 14h 12m +9m = 14h 21m, and the night is 9h 39m. The ratio is now 1.49. Taking the effect of refraction into consideration the ratio for **Gāndhār also becomes 1.46**, which is not much different from 1.50 as for Babylon. So it is not necessary to assume that the ratio was obtained from Babylonian sources. 

## Effect of Procession
The Vedānga Jyotiṣa was prevalent for a long time over India, for over 1300 years (1000 B.C. to 300 A.D.). Hence it is likely that the subsequent astronomers noticed the gradual shift of the solstitial colure in the lunar-zodiac. In fact, several references are found to this effect. **Garga**, an astronomer whose name is found in the Mahabharata, where he is described as having an astronomical school at a place called **Gargasrota in the Sarasvatī basin**, is the reputed author of a pre-Siddhāntic calendaric treatise called **Garga Saṁhita**. He notes : 

Yadā nivartatē 'prāptaḥ śraviṣṭhām uttarāyaṇe  
Aśleṣām dakśiṇo 'prāptas tadā vindyān mahad bhayam. 

Translation : When at the time of Ottarāyana the sun is found turning (north) without reaching the Sraviṣthās; and (at the time of Dakṣiṇāyana) turning (south) without reaching the Aśleṣā, it should be taken to indicate a period of calamity. 

It shows that at the time of Garga the W.S. did no longer occur in Śraviṣthā, neither the S.S. occurred in the Aśleṣā division. At the time of Vedānga Jyōtiṣa the two solstices were marked by the starting point of Śraviṣtha and the middle point of Asleṣā respectively. Garga therefore observed that the solstices were receding back over the lunar calendar, and had shifted at least by half a nakṣatra-division from the middle of Āṣleṣā. His observations are therefore at least 480 years later than those of the Vedānga Jyōtiṣa. 

In the Mahabharata we get the following verse : 

Aśvamedha, Chap. 44;2:  
Ahaḥ pūrvam tato rātrir  
māsāḥ śuklādayaḥ smr̥tāḥ  
śravaṇādīni r̥kṣāṇi  
r̥tavaḥ śiśirādayaḥ 

Translation : Day comes first and then the night ; months, are known to commence with the bright half, the nakṣatras with Śravaṇa, and the seasons with śiśira. 

Here the asterism **Śravaṇa** is described as the one where the **winter solstice** takes place. śravaṇa is just preceding śraviṣṭha and the solstices take about 960 years to retrograde through one nakṣatra division. 

We get from this the time of composition of the Mahābhārata as about 450 B.C. or sometime earlier.

Varahamihira also notes that the winter solstice: no longer took place at Dhaniṣṭhā.  

Pañica Siddhāntika, III, 21 A  
śleṣārdhād āsit yadā nivr̥ttiḥ kiloṣṇakiraṇasya  
Yuktam ayanan tadāsīt sāmpratamayanam punarvasūtaḥ. 

Translation : When the return of the sun towards the south (1.., the summer solstice ) took place from. the middle of Aśleṣa, tbe ayana was right, at the present time ayana begins from Punarvasu. 

In his Brhat Saṁhita, an astrological treatise, he records : 

Brhat-Samhitā, III, 1  
Asleṣārdhād dakṣiṇam uttaram ayanaṁ raver dhaniṣthādyam  
Nūnaṁ kadācid āsīt yenoktaṁ pūrvaśāstreṣu. 

Translation : The beginning of the southern motion when the sun has passed half of Aśleṣā and the beginning of the northern motion when the sun has passed the beginning of Dhaniṣthā, must have taken place at some epoch; for these are recorded in old treatises. 

From the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa to Varāhamihira's time the summer solstice moved through more than 1.5 nakṣatras ( 1/2 of āśleṣa + Puṣya ) which indicated a lapse of more than 1500 years from the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa. 

It is thus seen that the Hindu astronomers **observed the shifting of the cardinal points** due to precession of the equinoxes ; but as they **had not developed the sense of era**, they were **unable to find out the time interval between different records**, and obtain a rate for precession, as was done by Hipparchos. Their observations were also crude; as they used only the lunar zodiac. The shifting of the solstitial colures remained to them an unsolved mystery.
