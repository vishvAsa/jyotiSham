Rise of Siddhāntas or Scientific Astronomy: 

The Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendarical rules appear, from inscriptional records, to have been used right up to the end of the reign of the śātavāhanas (200 A.D.). The analysis of inscriptional data on methods of date recording given in § 5.5 shows that it was the śaka and Kuṣāṇa rulers (50 B.C. - 100 A.D.), who introduced the Graeco-Chaldean methods of date-recording, prevalent in' the Near East into India. These methods require a knowledge of the fundamentals of astronomy, which must have been available to the śaka and Kuṣāna rulers. In India, as 'the inscriptional records show, some purely Indian dynasts probably accepted the system in full from about 248 A.D. (date of foundation of the Kalachuri era, the earliest era founded by Indian kings, leaving aside the śaka era which is admittedly of foreign origin and the Vikrama era whose origin is still - shrouded in mystery). During the time of the Guptas who founded an era commemorating their accession to power in 319 A.D. the integration of the western system with the Indian appears to have been complete. 

Indian astronomical treatises, explaining the rules of calendaric astronomy, are known as Siddhāntas, but it is difficult to find out their dates. The earliest Indian astronomer who gave a date for himself was the celebrated Aryabhaṭa who flourished in the ancient city of Pataliputra and was born in 476 A.D. 

It is necessary to reply to a question which has very often been asked, but never satisfactorily answered, viz., 

Why did the Indian savants who were in touch with the Greeks, and probably with Greek science since the time of Alexander's raid (323 B.C.), take about 500-600 years to assimilate Greek astronomy, and use it for their own calendar-framing ? 

The Indians of 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., were quite vigorous in body as well as in intellect as is shown by their capacity to resist successive hordes of foreign invaders, and their remarkable contributions to religion, art, literature and certain sciences. Why did they not accept the fundamentals of Greek astronomy for calendarical calculations earlier ? 

The reply to this query appears to be as follows: 

The Greeks of Alexander's time had almost nothing to give to the Indians in calendaric astronomy, for their own knowledge of astronomy at this period was extremely crude and far inferior to that of the contemporary Chaldeans. The remarkable achieve ments of the Greeks in astronomy, and geometry,

though they started from the time. of Alexander. (Plato's Academy), really flowered in full bloom in the century following Alexander (330 B.Co - 200 B.C.). The culmination is found in Hipparchos of Rhodes who flourished from 160-120 B.C.; he wrote treatises on astronomy. Simultaneously in Seleucid Babylon, Chaldean and Greek astronomers made scientific contributions of the highest order to astronomy (vide § 4.7 & 4.8 ), but none of their works have survived, but are now being found by archaeological explorations. 

It is therefore, obvious that the Indians of the age of Asoka (273 B.C.—200 B.C.), who were in touch with the Greek kingdoms of Babylon and Egypt, had not much to learn from the Greeks in astronomy. 

The Maurya's were succeeded by the Sungas (186 B.C.--75 B.C.), but Indians during this age were in touch only with the Bactrian Greeks. But by this time, the Parthian empire had arisen (250 B.C.), producing a wedge between western and eastern Greeks. The only dated record of the Indo-Bactrian king, Menander (150 B.C.), is purely Indian in style. 

By about 150 B.C., direct contact between India and Greater Greece which included Babylon had almost ceased, due to the growth of the Parthian empire. Whatever ideas came, was through the śaka-Kuṣāna kingdoms which came into existence after 90 B. C. By that time, astronomy was regarded as only secondary to planetary and horoscopic astrology, which had grown to mighty proportions in the West. This may have been probably one of the main reasons for late acceptance of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy in India, for Indian thought during these years was definitely hostile to astrology. 

It will surprise many of our readers to be told that astrology was not liked by Indian leaders of thought, which dominated Indian life during the period 500 B.C.-1 A.D. Nevertheless, it is a very correct 

view. 

The Great Buddha, Whose thoughts and ideas dominated India from 500 B.C. to the early centuries of the Christian era, was a determined foe of astro logy. In Buddha's time, and for hundreds of years after Buddha, there was in India no elaborate planetary or horoscopic astrology, but a crude kind of astrology based on conjunctions of the moon with stars and on various kinds of omina such as appearance of comets, eclipses, etc. But Buddha appears to have held even such astrological forecasts in great contempt, as is evident from the following passage ascribed to him : 

Yathā vā pan'eke bbonto. Samaṇa-brāhmanā saddhā-deyyāni bhojanāni bhuñjitva te evarūpāya tiraccbāna-vijjāya micchājīvena-jībika m kappenti 

Translation : Some brāhmaṇas and framanas earn their livelihood by taking to beastly professions and eating food brought to them out of fear ; they say : "there will be a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse, occulta tion of the stars, the sun and the moon will move in the correct direction, in the incorrect direction, the nakṣatras will move in the correct path, in the incorrect path, there will be precipitation of meteors, burning of the cardinal directions (?), earth quakes, roar of heavenly war drums, the sun, the moon, and the stars will rise and set wrongly producing wide distress amongst all beings, etc." 

This attitude to astrology and astrolatry on the part of Indian leaders of thought during the period of 500 B.C. to 100 A.D., was.undoubtedly a correct one, and would be welcomed by rationalists of all ages and countries. But such ideas had apparently a very deterrent effect on the study of astronomy in India. Pursuit of astronomical knowledge was confused with astrology, and its cultivation was definitely forbidden in the thousands of monasteries which sprang all over the country within few hundred years of the Nirvana (544 B.C./ 483 B.C). Yet monasteries were exactly the places where astronomical studies could be quietly. pursued and monks were, on account of their leisure and temparament, eminently fitted for taking up such studies, as had happened later in Europe, where some of the most eminent astronomers came from the monkist ranks, e.g., Copernicus and Fabricius. 

Neither did Hindu leaders, opposed to Buddhism, encourage astrology and astrolatry. The practical politician thought that the practice of astrology was not conducive to the exercise of personal initiative and condemned it in no uncertain terms. In the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya, a treatise on statecraft, which took shape between 300 B.C. and 100 A.D., and is ascribed to Canakya, the following passage is found :

Aryabhaṭa and Varahamihira who made great scientfic contributions to 'astronomy belonged to this race. The planetary Sungod is always shown with high boots on, as in the case of Central Asian kings (e.g., Kaniṣka)... 

It is a task for the historian to trace how the steps in which the importation of western astronomical knowledge took place for the Siddhāntas, which incorporate this knowledge and are all a few centuries later, and many of them bear no date. . 

A good point d'appui for discussion is Vardhamihira's Panca Siddhāntikā.; for Varahamihira's date is known. He died in 587 A.D., in ripe old age so he must have written his book about 550 A.D. This is a compendium reviewing the knowledge contained in the five Siddhāntas which were current at his time. These were regarded as 'Apauruṣeya' or "knowledge revealed by gods or mythical persons”. 

Translation: The' objective (artha) eludes the foolish man (balam) who enquires too much from the 'stars. The objective should be the nakṣatra of the 

objective, of what avail are the stars? 

This may be taken to represent the views of the practical politician about astrology and astrolatry, during the period 500 B.C. to 100 B.C. 

Canakya was the great minister of Candragupta, and history says that these two great leaders rolled back the bordes of the Macedonians, who had con. quered the Acheminid Empire of Iran comprising the whole of the Near East to the borders of Iran; and thereafter laid the foundation of the greatest empire India has ever seen. They clearly not only did not believe in astrology, but openly, and without reserve, ridiculed its pretensions. 

But the influence of original Buddhism waned after the rise of Mahāyānist Buddhism, which received great encouragement during the reign of Kaniṣka (78 A.D. to 102 A.D.) and other Kuṣāna and śaka kings. Then came Buddhist iconography, coins, and knowledge of the methods of western date-recording which the śakas and Kuṣānas used. They blended with the indigenous Indian system slowly. 

The focus of diffusion of western astronomical knowledge appears to have been the city of Ujjayini, capital of the western Satraps who were apparently the first to use a continuous era ( the śaka era ), and a method of date-recording which was at first purely Graeco-Chaldean as prevalent in Seleucid Babylon, but gradually Indian elements like the tithi and the nakṣatra were blended, as we find for the first time in the inscription of Satrap Rudrasimha, dated 181 A.D. (vide § 5.5). 

This city of Ujjayini was later adopted as the Indian Greenwich, for the measurement of longitudes of places. The borrowal of astronomical knowledge was not therefore from Greece direct, but as now becomes increasingly clearer, from the West, which included Seleucid Babylon, and probably : through Arsacid Persia. The language of culture in these regions was Greek, and we therefore find Greek words like kendra fcentre), liptika (lepton), horā (hour) in use by Indian astronomers 

This view is supported by the Indian myth that astrolatry and astrology were brought to India by a party of śakadvipi Brahmanas (Scythian Brahmins), who were invited to come to India for curing Samba, the son of Krṣna, of leprosy by means of incantations 

· The five Siddhāntas are : 

Paitāmaha Ascribed to Grandfather Brahma. Vāsiṣtha Ascribed to the mythical sage 

Vasiṣtha, a Vedic patriarch, and 

revealed by him to one Māndavya. Romaka Revealed by god Viṣnu to Rṣi Romasa 

or Romaka. Paulisa · Ascribed sometimes to the sage 

Pulastya, one of the seven seers or patriarchs forming the Great Bear 

constellation of stars (but see later). Surya Revealed by the Sungod to Asura 

Maya, architect of gods, who 

propounds them to the Rṣis. . The five Siddhāntas are given in the increasing order of their accuracy according to Varahamihira. Thus Varahamihira considers the Sarya Siddhānta as the most accurate, and next in order are the Paulića, and the Romaka. The Vasiṣtha and Paitāmaha are, according to Varāhamibira, not accurate. 

Why were those Siddhāntas regarded as “Apaurus ṣeya" (i.e. not due to any mortal man) ? Dikṣit says (Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra, Part II, Chap. 1): 

"The knowledge of astronomy as seen developed during the Vedic and Vedānga Jyotiṣa periods and described in Part I, was wide as compared with the length of the period ; but it is very meagre, when com pared with the present position***. The oldest of astronomical knowledge (given in the oldest Siddbāntas) reveal .a sudden rise in the standard of astronomical knowledge. . Those who raised the standard as given 

INDIAN-CALENDAR 

We need not go any further into the contents of this Siddhānta. As the name indicates, the knowledge was borrowed from the West, which was vaguely known as 'Romaka' after the first century A.D. The yuga taken is quite un-Indian, but appears to be a blending of the nineteen-year cycle of Babylon, the five-yearly yuga of Vedānga Jyotisa, and the number 30 which is the number of tithes in a month. The length of the year is identical with Hipparchos's (365.2467), and this alone of the Siddhāntas gives a length of the year which is unmistakeably tropical. . 

• The Romaka Siddhānta appears to represent a distinct school who tried to propagate western astro nomical knowledge on the lines of Hipparchos. One of the later propounders was śrisena, who flourished between Aryabhaça and Brahmagupta ; the latter ridicules him roundly for having made a "kānthā”, i.ex a wrapper made out of discarded rags of all types meaning probably Sriṣena's attempt to blend two incongruous systems of knowledge, western and eastern. 

in these works were naturally regarded as superbuman. and hence the available ancient works on astronomy are regarded as: 'apauruṣeya' i.e. not compiled by mortal men) and it is clear that the belief has been 

formed later". 

This statement, made by Dikṣit nearly sixty years ago, really singles out only one phase of the issue, viz., the wide gulf in the level of astronomical knowledge of the Siddhāntas and that in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa ; but leaves the question of actual authorship open. In our opinion the Siddhāntas were regarded as Apauruṣeya because they appear to have been com pilations by different schools of the knowledge of calendaric astronomy, as they diffused from the West during the period 100 B.C.-400 A.D. But let us look into them a little more closely. 

The Paitamaha Siddhānta : described in five stanzas in Chap. XII. of the Panca Siddhāntikā. 

As already discussed it is a revised edition of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa ,but later authors say that it contained rules for the calculation of motions of the sun, the. moon and also the planets which were not given by the Vedānga Jyotiṣa. As the full text of the original - Siddhānta has not been recovered, it is difficult to say 

how the borrowal took place. 

The Vasistha Siddhānta : as known to Varahamihira is described in 13 couplets in Chap. II of the Parica Siddhāntika. It describes methods of calculating tithi and nakṣatra, which are inaccurate. Besides it mentions Rāśi (zodiacal signs), angular measurements, discusses length of the day, and the lagna (ascendant part of the zodiac). Apparently this represents one attempt by a school to propagate western astronomical knowledge, The school persisted and we have. Vāsiṣtha Siddhāntas later than Varāhamihira. One of the most famous was Viṣnucandra (who was somewhat later than Āryabhaṭa) who was conscious of the phenomenon of precession of the equinoxes. No text of the Siddhānta is available, except some quotations. 

Varahamihira pays a formal courtesy to Paitāmaha and Vāśiṣtha; this does not prevent him from describing these two as 'dūravibhraṣtau', i.e., furthest from truth. 

The Paulisa Siddhānta : This Siddhānta 'was at one time regarded as the ival of the Sūrya Siddhānta, but no“ text is available now. But it continued to be current up to the time of Bhattotpala (966 A.D.), who quotes from it. 

Alberuni (1030-44 A.D.) who was acquainted with it, said that it was an adaptation from an astronomical treatise of Paulus of Saintbra, i.e., of Alexandria. But it.is not clear whether he had actually seen Paulus's treatise, and compared it with the Paulisa Siddhānta or simply made a guess on the analogy of names merely, The name of one Paulus is found in the Alexandrian list of savants (378 A.D.) but his only known work is one on astrology, and it has nothing in common with Paulisa Siddhāntā, which appears to have been purely añ astronomical treatise as we can reconstruct it from the Pañca Siddhāutikā (vide infra). The ascription to Paulus.of Alexandria is not therefore proved. There is, however, reference in the Paulisa Siddhānta to Alexandria, or Yavanapura, as it was known to Hindu savants. The longitudes of Ujjain, and Banaras are given with reference to Alexandria (P.S., Chap. III). 

The Pañia Siddhāntikā devotes à few stanzas of Chaps. I, III, VI, VII, and VIII to this exposition of the Paulisa Siddhānta. Nobody seems to have gone critically into the contents of these chapters after Dr. Thibaut who tried to explain these in his introduction to the Panica Siddhāntika, but left most of them unexplained owing to their obscurity. 

In Chap. I. (verses 24-25), 30 Lords of the days of the month are mentioned. This is quite un-Indian

and reminds one of the Iranian calendar in which each one of thirty days of the month is named after a god or principle (see § 2.3). The names of the lords of the days as given in the Paulisa Siddhānta are of course all Indian.

The Surya Siddhānta Of all the Siddhāntas mentioned by Varāhamihira this alone has survived and is still regarded with veneration by Indian astrologers. This Siddhānta was published with annotations by Rev. E. Burgess, in 1860, and has been republished by the Calcutta University under the editorship of.P. L. Gangooly, with an intro duction by Prof. P. C. Sengupta. . 

This is supposed to have been described by the ṣungod to Asura Maya, the architect of the gods, who revealed it to the Indian Rṣis. These legends certainly represent some sort of borrowing from the West, but it would be fruitless to define its exact nature unless the text is more critically examined. Varāhamihira describes in Chapters IX, X, XI, XVI, XVII of the Panca Siddhāntikā the contents of the Surya Siddhānta as known to him ; they are somewhat different from those as found in the modern text. It appears that this Siddhānta was constantly revised with respect to the astronomical constants contained in it as all astronomical treatises should be. The text as we have now was fixed up by Ranganatha in 1603 after which there have been no changes. Burgess, from a study of the astronomical constants, thought that the final text referred to the year 1091 A.D. Prof. P. C. Sengupta shows that the S.S. as reported by Varahamihira borrowed elements of astronomical data from Aryabhaṭa, and the S.S. as current now has borrowed elements from Brahmagupta (628 A.D.). 

The modern Surya Siddhānta is a book of 500 verses divided into 14 chapters, contents of which are described briefly below : 

Chap. I-Mean motions of the Planets. 

II–True places of the Planets. III-Direction, Place, and Time. IV-Eclipses, and especially Lunar 

Eclipses. V--Parallax in a Solar Eclipse, VI–Projection of Eclipses. VII—Planetary Conjunctions. VIII The Asterisms.. 

IX-Heliacal Risings and Settings. : 

X-Moon's Risings -and Settings, and 

the Elevation of her Cusps. XI-Certain malignant Aspects of the 

Sun and the Mocn. 

A scrutiny of the text shows that it is, with the exception of a few elements, almost completely astro nomical. A few verses in Chap. III, viz., Nos. 9-12 deal with the trepidation theory of the precession of equinoxes. These are regarded by all critics of the Surya Siddhānta to be interpolations made after the 12th century., 

It will take us too much away from our main theme to give a critical account of this treatise, but every critic has admitted that the text does not show any influence of Ptolemy's Almagest. Prof. P. C. Sen gupta's introduction is particularly valuable. This Siddhānta indicates that longitudes should be calculated from Ujjain and makes no mention of Alexandria. Prof. Sengupta thinks that it dated from about 400 A.D., but a scrutiny of the co-ordinates of certain stars marking the ecliptic, which we have discussed in Appendix 5-B, shows that it might have utilized data collected about 280 A.D., when the star Cierā lα Virginis), was close to the autumnal equinoctial point, and is therefore subsequent to 280 A.D. 

The rules of framing the calendar are found in Chapter XII of which we give an account in the next section. 

After about 500 A.D., the Indian astronomers gave up the pretext of ascribing astronomical treatises to gods or mythical sages and began to claim authorship of the treatises they had written ; the earliest that has survived is that of Aryabhaṭa (476—523 A.D.). The objects of their treatises were to frame rules for calendaric calculations, knowledge of astronomy forming the basis on which these rules were framed. 

In addition to the Surya Siddhānta only two other systems have survived, viz., 

The Arya Siddhānta-due to Aryabhaṭa II, an astronomer of the 10th century, and supposed to be related to the Aryabhaṭīya of Aryabhaṭa, who claims to have derived it from Brahmā, the Creator. 

The Brahma Siddhānta-vaguely related to the Paitāmaha Siddhānta, but the human authorship is ascribed to the celebrated astronomer Brahmagupta (628 A.D.). 

But a number of astronomical treatises like that of Siddhānta śiromani by Bhaskaracārya and many others, have survived either on account of their own merit or their connection with astrology. INDIAN OALENDAR

Lanka, which is technically the name of a locality on the equator lying in the meridian of Ujjayini, which was the Greenwich of ancient India. This Laska had nothing to do with Ceylon, but is a fictitious name; 

90° west of Lankā the city called Romaka, and 90° east of Lanka the city known as Yamakoţi. 

The name Romaka vaguely refers to the capital of the Roman Empire. 'Yamakoți' is quite fanciful. 

The Surya Siddhānta takes it for granted that the sun's yearly motion through the ecliptic is known to the reader and now proceeds to explain the Signs of the Zodiac.

The Solar Calendar according to the 

Surya Siddhānta The first few verses of Chap. XII deal with the creation of the world according to Hindu conception, and the creation of the elements ; of the sun, the moon, and the planets. The universe is taken to be geocentric, and the planets in order of their decreasing distances from the earth are given as (vide verse 31,) : 

Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury 

and the Moon. The fixed stars are placed beyond the orbit of Saturn. 

Surya Siddhānta, XII, Verse 32 Madhye samantāt daṇdasya bhūgolo byomni tiṣthati Bibhrāṇaḥ paramām saktim brahmaño dbāraṇātmikāni. 

Translation : Quite in the middle of the celestial egg (Brahmānda), the earth sphere (Bhugola) stands in the ether, bearing the supreme might of Brahmā which has the nature of a self supporting force. 

The astronomers are thus conscious that the earth is a spherical body suspended in ether (byomni) 

Verse 34 : Describes the earth's polar axis, which passing through the earth's centre emerges as . mountains of gold on either side. 

Verse 35 : Gods and Rṣis are supposed to dwell on the upper (northern) pole, and the demons are supposed to dwell on the nether (south) pole. 

Verse 43 : Describes two pole-stars (Dhruva-tārās) which are fixed in the sky. 

The author could have been aware only of the Polaris. By analogy he inferred the existence of a southern pole-star which, as is well-known, does not exist. He had apparently no knowledge of the sky far south of the equator. 

The remaining verses describe the equator . As in modern astronomy, it says that the polar star is on the horizon of a person on the equator and the co-latitude (Lambaka) of the equator is 90°. 

The Siddhāntic astronomers thus completely accepted the geocentric theory of the solar system. It was a great improvement on the ideas of the world prevalent in India at the time of the great epic Mahabharata (date about 300 B.C.), in which the earth is described to be a flat disc, with the Sumeru mountain as a protruding peg in the centre, round which the diurnal motion of the celestial globe carrying the stars, planets the sun and the moon takes place. This idea of the world is also found in the Jātakas and other Buddhist scriptures. 

• In the subsequent verses four cardinal points on the , equator are recognized, these are : 

Translation : In the half revolution beginning with Meṣādi (lit. the initial point of Aries), the sun being in the hemisphere of gods, is visible to the gods, ; but while in that beginning with Tulādi (lit. the initial point of Libra) he is visible to the demons moving in their hemesphere. 

This means that when the sun reaches Meṣādi, the initial point of the sign of Aries, the gods who are supposed to be in the north pole just witness the rising of the sun and has the sun over the horizon for six months. All these six months, the demons who are supposed to be at the south pole are in the dark. It is vice versa for their enemies the Asuras for whom, dwelling in the south pole, the sun rises for them when it is at Tulādi (beginning of the Tula sign i.e., first point of Libra) and remains above the horizon for six months. 

According to the S.S., therefore, the first point of Aries is coincident with the vernal equinoctial point, and the first point of Libra with the autumnal equinoctial point.

Thence also are reckoned the seasons (rtu), the cool season (sidera) and the rest,' each prevailing through two signs. These twelve, commencing with

These quotations leave not the slightest doubt that according to the compilers of the S.S., the first point of the zodiac is the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, and the signs of the zodiac cover 30° each of the ecliptic. 

It is supposed on good grounds that much of the astronomical knowledge found in the Surya Siddhānta is derived from Graeco-Chaldean sources. But it is clear from the text that the compilers of the S.S. had no knowledge of the precession of equinoxes, but they took the first point of Aries to be fixed. This is not to be wondered at, for as shown in § 4.9, inspite of the works of Hipparchos and Ptolemy, precession was either not accepted or no importance was attached to it by the astronomers of the Roman empire. It may be added that the compilers of the S.S. were not aware of the theory of trepidation of equinoxes which appears to have been first formulated in the West by Theon of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.). It is also important to note that the Indian astronomers did not take the first point of Aries to be identical with that given either by Hipparchos, Ptolemy or any other western authority as would have been the case if there was blind-folded borrowing. They assimilated the astro nomical knowledge intelligently and took the first point of Aries as the point of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic, and made successive attempts to determine it by some kind of actual observations, 28 shown in appendix 5-B. These observations appear first to have been made about 280 A.D. 

precession of the equinoxes, they were unaware of the distinction between the sidëreal year and the tropical year. They had to obtain the year-length either from observation or from outside sources. If they obtained it from observations, they must have counted the number of days passed between the return of the sun to the same point in the sky over a number of years. Such observations would show that the year had not the traditional value of 366 days given in Veranga Jyotiṣa, but somewhat less. In fact, the Paitāmaha length is 365.3569 days and there is no reason to believe that it was derived from foreign sources. Successive observations must have enabled the Indian savants to push the accuracy still higher.. 

Or alternatively they might have borrowed the value from Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, but we cannot then explain why their value is larger than Ptolemy's. We have seen that the Romaka Siddhānta gives a value which is Hipparchos's, and tropical, but the three more correct Siddhāntas reject it, as being too small. This however indicates that they probably tried to derive the length from observations as stated in the previous paragraph and found the Romaka Siddhānta-length too small. If they had taken it from some other source, we have still to discover that source. It is certainly not Ptolemy's Almagest. 

The ex-cathedra style of writing adopted by the Siddhāntic astronomers, e.g., the number of days in a Kalpa (a period of 4.32 x 10 years) is 1,577,917,828,000 according to Grandfather Brahmā, or the Sungod, does not enable one to trace the steps by which these conclusions were reached. 

The two problems of (i) distinguishing between the tropical year, and the sidereal year and of (ii) deter.. mining the correct length of the year in terms of the mean solar days are very exacting ones. 

We have seen how it took the West the whole time-period between 3000 B.C. to. 1582 A.D. to arrive at the idea that the true length of the tropical year was close to 365.2425 days. Probably Iranian astrono-. mers of Omar Khayam's time (1072 A.D.), who had the advantage of the great Arabian observations by al Baţțānī and others had a more correct knowledge of this length. The final acceptance of the distinction between the tropical and the sidereal year dates only from 1687 A.D., when Newton proved the theary of trepidation to be wrong. 

· The Siddhāntic astronomers of 500-900 A.D. cannou therefore be blamed for their failure to grasp the two problems. But what to say of their blind followers who, in the twentieth century, would continue. to proclaim their belief in the theory.of trepidation ?

N. B. Varāhamibira's length of the year is also found in Aryabhaṭa's ārdharātrika, or midnight system, and in Brahmagupta's Khanda Khôdya ka. 

How did the Indianrants manage to have such a wrong value for the length of the year? 

The year, according to the Surya. Siddhānta is meant to be clearly tropical, but as the Indian savants compiling the S,S..were:ignorant of the phenomenon of 

INDIAN CALENDAR 

241 

(a) Starting the astronomical year from the moment the sun crosses the vernal: equinoctial point. 

(b) . Starting the civil year on the day following. 

The Siddhāntic astronomers thus brought the Indian calendar on a line with the Graeco-Chaldean calendar prevalent in the Near East during the Seleucid times. 

In a few cases, e.g., in the case of the Vikrama era reckoning as followed in parts of Guzrat, the year. beginning is in Kārtika. This seems to be reminiscent of the custom amongst the Macedonian Greek rulers of Babylon to start the year on the autumnal equinox day. 

· Effect of continuance of the mistake The Surya Siddhānta value, viz., 365.258756 days is larger than the correct sidereal value by .002394 days and larger than the tropical length by .016560 days. 

As the S.S. value is still used in almanac-framing, the effect has been that the year:beginning is advancing by .01656 days per year, so that in course of nearly 1400 years, the year-beginning has advanced by 23.2 days, so that the Indian solar year, instead of starting on the day after the vernal equinox (March 22) now starts on April 13th or 14th. The situation is the same as happened in Europe, where owing to the use of a year-length of 365.25 days, since the time of Julius Cæsar, the Christmas preceded the winter solstice by 10 days, when the error was rectified by a Bull of Gregory XIII, and the calendar was stabilized by introducing revised leap-year rules. 

The Calendar Reform Committee has proposed that the Indian New Year should start on the day after the vernal equinox day. Most of the Indian calendar makers belong to the no-changer school, or the nirayaṇa school (i.e., school not believing in the precession of the equinoxes). But this school does not realize that even if the sidereal length of the year be: acceped, the Indian year-length used by them is larger by nearly .0024 days, which cannot be tolerated. So if a change has to be made, it is better to do it whole-hog, i.e., take the year-length to be tropical, and start the year on the day after the vernal equinox. 

. This is the proposal of the Indian Calendar Reform Committee, and it is in full agreement with the canons laid down in the Surya Siddhānta. 

The First Month of the Year : This has to be defined with respect to the defini tion of the seasons. 

. According to modern convention, which is derived from Graeco-Chaldean sources, the first season of the year is spring ; it begins on the day of vernal equinox, as shown in fig. 25 which shows also the other seasons. The Indian classification of seasons is however, different as the following table shows. 

Historical Note on the Year-beginning 

The Indian gear, throughout ages, has been of two kinds, the solar and the lunar, each having its own starting day. The year beginning for the two kinds of years, for different eras, is shown in Table No. 27. , 

Table 15-—Indian Seasons. —30° to 30°...Spring (Vasanta) Caitra & Vaisākha 

30 to 90 ... Summer (Grīṣma) Jyaiṣtha & Aṣadha 

90 to 150 ... Rains (Varṣa) Srāvapai & Bhādra 150 to 210 ... Early Autumn (Śarat) Āøvina & Kārtika 210 to 270 .. Late Autumn Agrahāyaṇa & Panpa 

(Hemanta) 270' to 330 ...Winter (Sisira) Magha & Phālguna 

The Siddhāntic astronomers, therefore, found themselves in a difficulty. If they were to follow the Indian convention, Caitra would be the first month of the solar year. If they were to follow the Graeco Chaldean covention, they had to take Vaiśākha as the first month of the solar year. 

They struck a compromise. For defining the solar year, they took Vaiśākha as the first month and for defining the lunar year they took Caitra as the first month (see § 57). 

But this rule has been followed only in North India. In South India, they had different practices, as shown in the list of solar month-names (Table No. 16). 

In North India the first month is Vaiśākha as laid down in the S.S. which starts just after sun's passage through the V.E. point. 

It is interesting to see that in Tamil Nad, some of the names are of Sanskritic origin, others are of Tamil origin. But the most siriking fact is that the first month, starting after vernat equinox is not Vaiśākha as in the 

The Starting Day of the Solar Year In the Vedic age, the year-beginning was related "probably to one of the cardinal days of the year, but we do not know which cardinal day it was. The Vedānga Jyotiṣa started the year from the winter solstice day, Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian Spring (Vasarthe phen the tropical (Sāyana) "longitude of the sun amounted to 330°. 

The Siddhāntic astronomers must have found a confusion, and so fixed up a rule for fixing the year. beginning, which we have just now dicussed. These rules amount to :

In Tinnevelley and Malayalam districts the solar , months are named after the signs of the zodiac. 

There is, therefore, no uniformity of practice in the nomenclature of the solar months, and in fixing up the name of the first month of the solar year. 

Solar Months : Definition: 

After having defined the solar year, and the year beginning, the Surya Siddhānta proceeds to define the "Solar Month." 

Surya Siddhānta, Chap. 1,13 Aindavastitþibbi-stadyat samkrāntyā saura' ucyate Māsairdvādaśabhirvarṣam divyam tada harucyate. 

Translation : A lunar month, of as many lunar days (titha) ; a solar (saura) month is determined by the entrance of the sun into a sign of the zodiac, i.e. the length of the month is the time taken by the sun in passing 30° of its orbit, beginning from the initial point of a sign ; twelve months make a year, this is called a day or the gods. 

This definiton is accepted by the Ārya, and Brahma Siddhāntas as well. 

The working of this rule gives rise to plenty of difficulties, which are described below : 

The mean length of a solar month 

= 30.43823 according to S.S. 

= 30.43685 according to modern data. 

The actual lengths of the different solar months, however, differ widely from the above mean values. This is due to the fact that the earth does not move with uniform motion in a circular orbit round the sun, but moves in an elliptic orbit, one focus of which is occupied by the sun, and according to Kepler's second law, it sweeps over equal areas round the sun in equal intervals of time. When the earth is farthest from the sun, i.e. at aphelion (sun at apogee) of the elliptic orbit, the actual velocity of the earth becomes slowest, and the apparent angular velocity of the sun becomes minimum, and consequently the length of the solar month is greatest. This happens about 3rd or. 4th July, i.e., about the middle of the solar month of Aṣadha (Mithuna), and consequently this month has got the greatest length. The circumstances become reversed six months later on about 2nd or 3rd January, when the earth is nearest to the sun, i.e., at perihelion (sun at perigee), the angular velocity of the 

sun at that time becomes maximum, and consequently 

· the solar month of Pausa (Dhanuḥ) which is 

opposite to Aṣadha, has got the minimum length. The following two figures ( Nos. 25 & 26 ) will explain the position. 

The durations of the different months, which are different from each other due to the above reason, are also not fixed for all time. The durations of the solar

made up of the precessional velocity of 50,"27 per year in the retrograde direction and the perihelion velocity of 11."62 per year in the direct direction due to planetary attraction. This movement of the apse line with respect to the V.E. point causes variation in the lengths of the different months. 

(ii) The second reason is that the ellipticity of the earth's orbit is not constant ; it is gradually changing. At present the eccentricity of the orbit is diminishing and the elliptic orbit is tending to become circular. As a result, the greatest duration of the month is diminishing in length and the least one increasing. Similarly the lengths of other months are also undergoing variation.

The modern elliptic theory of planetary orbits was Fig. 25 

not known to the makers of Indian Siddhāntas, but 

they knew that the sun's true motion was far (i) the line of apsides of the earth's elliptic orbit 

from uniform. They conceived that the sun has (i.e., the aphelion and perihelion points) is not fixed 

uniform motion in a circle, with the earth not exactly at the centre of that circle, but at a small distance from it. The orbit therefore becomes an eccentric circle or an epicycle. Here also the .angular motion of the sun becomes minimum when at apogee or farthest from the earth, and maximum when 

nearest to the earth or at perigee. In this case the po frio)--- ----------44)-------- 

size and eccentricity of the circle are invariable quantities, and consequently the maximum and minimum limits of the months are constant. The apse line advances in this case also, but with a very slow motion, which according to the Surya Siddhānta 

amounts to a degree of arc in 31,008 years, or 11" in a Fig. 26 

century. The variations of the durations of months 

due to this slow motion of the apse line is quite in space but is advancing along the ecliptic at the negligible and the lengths of the months according to rate of 61".89 per year or 1.°72 per century. This is the Sūrya Siddhānta are practically constant over ages.

In the Sūrya Siddhānta, a formula is given for finding the true longitude of the sun from its mean longitude. As the length of a month is the time taken by the sun to traverse arcs of 30° each along the ecliptic by its true motion, the lengths of the different months can be worked out when its true longitudes on different dates of the year are known. The true longitude is obtained by the Sūrya Siddhānta with the help of the following formula : 

True Long. - Mean Long.–133.'68 sin K 

+3.'18 sina K where K=Mandakendra of the sun, 

3.e., - mean sun-sun's apogee. 

Different convontions for fixing up the 

beginning of the solar month The samkranti oi ingress of the sun into the different signs may take place at any hour of the day. Astronomically speaking the month starts from that moment. But for civil purposes, the month should start from a sunrise ; it should therefore start either on the day of the saṁkrānti or the next following day according to the convention adopted for the locality. There are four different conventions in different States of India for determining the beginning of the civil month. 

Rules of Samkranti 

At the approximate time of each saṁkrānti, the true longitude of the sun is calculated by the above formula for two successive days, one before the attainment of the desired multiple of 30° of longitude and the other after it, and then the actual time of crossing the exact multiple of 30th degree is obtained by the rule of simple proportion. This is called the time of saṁkrānti or solar transit. The time interval between the two successive saṁkrāntis is the actual length of the month, The lengths of the months thus derived from the Sūrya Siddhānta compared with the modern values, s.c., the values which we get after taking the elliptic motion of the sun, and the shift of the first point of Aries are shown in Table No. 17, on p. 243, in which : 

Column (1) gives the names of months. 

... (2) gives the arc measured from the first 

point of Aries (the V.E. point) covered by the true longitude 

of the sun. (3) gives the lengths of the months 

derived from the Sūrya 

Siddhānta rules. (4) gives the correct lengths of the 

months as in 1950 A.D. (5) gives the corresponding names of the 

months as proposed by the Committee.. 

The Bengal rule : In Bengal, when a samkrānt: takes place between sunrise and midnight of a civil day, the solar month begins on the following day; and when it occurs after midnight, the month begins on the next following day, i.e., on the third day. This is the general rule ; but if the saṁkrānti occurs in the period between 24 minutes before midnight to 24 minutes after midnight, then the duration of tithi current at sunrise will have to be examined. If the tithi at sunrise extends up to the moment of saṁkrānti, the month begins on the next day : if the tithi ends before sainkrānti, the month begins on the next following or the third day. But in case of Karkata and Makara samkrantes, the criterion of tithi is not to be considered. If the Karkata saṁkrānti falls in the above period of 48 minutes about the midnight, the month begins on the next day, and if the Makara sankranti falls in that period, the month begins on the third day. 

The Orissa rule : In Orissa the solar months of the Amli and Vilayati eras begin civilly on the same day (sunrise to next sunrise) as the saṁkrānti, irrespective of whether this takes place before or after midnight.. 

The Tamil rule : In the Tamil districts the rule is that when a saṁkrānti takes place before sunset, the month begins on the same day, while if it takes place after sunset the month begins on the following day.. 

The Malabar rule: The rule observed in the North and South-Malayalam country is that, if the samkranti takes place between sunrise and 18 ghaṭikās 17h 12) or more correctly fth of the duration of day from sunrise (about 1-12 P.M.) the month begins on the same day, otherwise it begins on the following day. 

It will be observed that as a result of the different conventions combined with the incorrect month lengths of the Sarya Siddhānta we are faced with the following problems 

It would appear from table No. 17 that the lengths of the months of the Sūrya Siddhānta are no longer correct; they greatly differ from their corres ponding modern vāliin sometimes by as much as 111 hours. The Surya Siddhānta values, which the almanac makers still use, are therefore grossly incorrect. Moreover, the lengths of the months are undergoing gradual variation with times due to reasons already explained.

"INDIAN CALENDAR 

245 : 

... (1) the civil day of the solar month-beginning 

may differ by 1 to 2 days in different parts of India. 

(2) The integral number of days of the different solar months also vary from 29 to 32. 

The mouths of Kārtika, Agrahāyana, Pauṣa, Māgha and Phālguna contain 29 or 30 days each, of which two months must be of 29 days, and others of 30 days. The months Caitra, Vaiśākha and Asvina contain 30 or 31 days. 

The rest, viz., Jyaiṣtha, Āṣādha, Śrāvana and Bhadra have got 31 to 32 days each, of which one or two months will contain 32 days every year. 

(3) The length of the month by integral number. of civil days is not fixed, it varies from year to year. 

from such rules vary from 29 to 32, which is very inconvenient from various aspects of civil life. 

The Committee has therefore felt that there is no need for keeping the solar months as astronomically defined. The length of 30 and 31 days are quite enough. for civil purposes. Moreover, fixed durations of months by integral number of days is the most convenient system in calendar making. The five months from the second to the sixth have the lengths of over 30 days, and so their lengths have been rounded to 31 days each ; and to the remaining months 30 days have been allotted.
