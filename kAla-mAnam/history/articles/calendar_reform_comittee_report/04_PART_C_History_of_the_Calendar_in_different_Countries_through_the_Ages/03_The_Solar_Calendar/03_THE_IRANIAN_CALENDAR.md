title = "03 THE IRANIAN CALENDAR"

+++

The great Iranian conqueror Darius (520 B. C.), whose empire comprised Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and Asia Minor, besides his native country of Iran, certainly came into contact with the diverse calendars of older civilizations, but he appears to have **preferred the Egyptian calendar** to the more complex Babylonian calendar, and introduced it in his vast empire. 

But the astronomers of Darius made correction of the deficit of 1 day of the year in another way. They had all years of 365 days, but used an **interaclary month of 30 days in a cycle of 120 years**. 

All the names of the **old Iranian months** and details of their calendar are not available now. The month-names as far as could be traced are stated below: 

- Thuravahara 
- Thaigraci 
- Adukani 
- ...
- Garmapada 
- ... 
- Bāgayadi 
- ... 
- Atriyadija 
- Anāmaka 
- Margazana 
- Viyachna

After the Islamic conquest of Persia in 648 A.D., the purely lunar calendar of Islam (Hejira) was imposed on Persia, but it does not appear to have been liked by the native Iranians. 

In 1074-75 the Seljuq Sultan Jelal Uddin Melik Shah called upon the celebrated **Omar Khayyam** and seven others to reform the old Persian calendar. The calendar as reformed by them was called **Tarikh i-Jelali**, its era was the 10th Ramadan of Hejira 471 – 16th March, 1079 A.D. There are **many interpretations** of the Jelali reform, the modern interpretation being 8 intercalary days in 33 years, giving the length of the year as **365.24242 days**. The year started from the day of or next to vernal equinox. 

The Parsees in India, the followers of the Prophet Zarathustra are the descendants of Iranians who took shelter in India on the conquest of Persia by the Arabs. The following details about their calendar is reproduced from Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th edition), Parsees : 

The Parsees of India are divided into two sects, the **Shahanshahis** and the **Kadmis**. They differ as to the correct chronological date for the computation of the era of **Yazdegerd**, the last king of Sassanian dynasty, who was **dethroned by the caliph Omar** about A.D. 640: This led to the variation of a month in the celebration of the festivals. The Parsees compute time from the fall of Yazdegerd. Their calendar is divided into **twelve months of thirty days** each ; the other five days, being added for holy days, are not counted. Each day is named after some particular angel of bliss, under whose special protection it is passed. On feast days a division of five watches is made under the protection of five different divinities. In midwinter a feast of six days is held in commemoration of the six periods of creation. About March 21, the vernal equinox, a festival is held in honour of agriculture, when planting begins. In the middle of April a feast is held to celebrate the creation of trees, shrubs and flowers. On the fourth day of the sixth month & feast is held in honour of Sahrevar, the deity presiding over mountains and mines. On the sixteenth day of the seventh month a feast is held in honour of **Mithra**, the deity presiding over and **directing the course of the sun, and also a festival to celebrate truth and friendship**. On the tenth day of the eighth month a festival is held in honour of Farvardin, the deity who presides over the departed souls of men. This day is especially set apart for the performance of ceremonies for the dead. The people attend on the hills where the "towers of silence" are situated, and in the sagris pray for the departed souls. The Parsee scriptures require the last ten days of the year to be spent in doing deeds of charity. 

In modern Iran when Riza Shah Pahlavi came to power in 1920, he instituted a reform of the existing Muslim calendar abandoning the strictly lunar reckoning and introducing purely solar year restoring the early Persian names which had never fallen entirely out of use.
