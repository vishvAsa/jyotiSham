## Lunar calendar

Like other nations of antiquity the early Egyptians had a year of **360 days divided into 12 months, each of 30 days**; but they found very early from the recurrence of the Nile flood, that the seasonal year consisted approximately of 365 days, and that a month or lunation (period from one new-moon to another) was nearly 29.4 days (real length 29.531 days). But they had already framed a calendar on the 30-day month, and 360-day year, which had received religious sanction. Hence arose the first necessity for calendar reform recorded in ancient history. To persuade the people to agree to this reform their priests invented the following myth : 

"The **Earth god Seb** and the **sky goddess Nut** had once illicit union. The supreme god **Ra**, the Sun, thereupon cursed the sky goddess Nut that the children of the union would be born neither in any year nor in any month. Nut turned to the **god of wisdom, Thoth**, for counsel. Thoth played & game of dice with the **Moon-goddess**, and won from her 1/72th part of of her light out of which he made five extra days. To appease Ra the Sun-god, these five days were given to him, and his year gained by five days while the Moon-goddess's year lost five days. The extra five days in the solar year were not attached to any month, which continued to have 30 days as before ; but these days came at the end of the year, and were celebrated as the birthdays of the gods born of the union of Seb and Nut, viz., **Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Set and Anubis**, five chief gods of the Egyptian pantheon.” - * Zinner-Geschichte der Sternkunde, p. 3.

## Initial solar calendar

Let us scrutinize the implications of this myth. This is tantamount to discarding the moon altogether as a time-maker, and basing the calendar entirely on the sun. This was a very wise step, for as has been found from ancient times, the moon is a very inconvenient time marker. The Egyptians maintained the old custom of keeping months of 30 days' duration, and 12 months made a year. But **five days (Epagomenai in Greek) were added to the year at the end**, which were not attached to any month. They were celebrated as national holidays. **Each month** of the Egyptian calendar was divided into **3 weeks, each of 10 days (Decads)**.' 

The names of the Egyptian months together with the dates of beginning of each month as they stood in 22 B.C., are as follows : 

- Egyptian Calendar Julian Calendar 
- 1 Thoth (30) 29 August 
- 1 Phaophi (30) 28 September 
- 1 Athyr (30) 28 October 
- 1 Choiak (30) 27 November 
- 1 Tybi 27 December 
- 1 Mechir (30) 26 January 
- 1 Phamenoth (30) 25 February 
- 1 Pharmuthi (30) 27 March 
- 1 Pachon (30) 26 April 
- 1 Payni (30) 26 May 
- 1 Epiphi (30) 25 June 
- 1 Mesori (30) 25 July 
- (1 Epagomenai 5) 24 August 

The year was divided into three seasons, each of four months : Flood time, Seed time and Harvest time. 

But the Egyptians soon found that even a year of 365 days did not represent the correct length of the year, which, as we now know, is nearly 3651 days. This fact they appear to have discovered in two different ways: 

- from their measurement of the length of the year from **heliacal risings of Sirius**, and 
- from their **long record of floods** extending over centuries. 

The fixed star **Sirius**, which is the most brilliant star in the heavens, was early associated with the chief goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, **Isis**, and was the subject of observation by her priests. The day of its first appearance on the **eastern horizon** at day-break (heliacal rising) appeared to have been carefully observed, and then on every subsequent day, its position in the sky at sunrise used to be noted. It was found that gradually it got ahead of the sun, so its appearance on the horizon would be observed sometime before sunrise, and on every successive sunrise, it would be found higher up in the heaven. After about a year it would be seen in the western horizon at sunset for a few days till it could no longer be traced. The Egyptians found as a result of long periods of observation, that it came again to the horizon at day break at the end of 365.25 days, not 365 days. If on one year, the heliacal rising of Sirius took place on **Thoth 1**, (Thoth was the name of the first month of the year) four years later it would take place on **Thoth 2**, and forty years later on **Thoth 11**. As the mean interval of heliacal rising of Sirius at the latitude of Memphis was 365.25 days, the Egyptians concluded that the heliacal rising of Sirius would continue to move round the year in a complete cycle of ca. 1460+++(=365*4)+++ years ; called the **Sothic cycle**, after Sothis (Isis) +++(before it coicides with Thoth 1)+++. They also appear to have found from observations over long periods of years that the Nile flood occurred not at intervals of 365 days, but of 365.25 days. 

On account of the deficiency of 1/4 day in the year, the year-beginning lost touch with the arrival of the Nile flood, though the temple **priests** had devised a method of finding out the interval between Thoth 1, and **arrival of the Nile flood by observations of the heliacal rising of the bright star Sirius**, identified with their chief goddess Isis. But they kept the knowledge to themselves. 

If the Egyptians carried out a reform of their calendar incorporating this fact, that the tropical year had a length of 365.25 days, their calendar could have been almost perfect. All that they had to do was to take 6 extra days instead of 5 every fourth year. But the 365 day year had so much soaked into the Egyptian mind, that this move for calendar reform was never adopted inspite of **serious attempts by earlier Pharoahs**, and later, a more serious one by **the Graeco-Egyptian ruler Ptolemy Euergetes** ( 238 B.C.). But it became generally known that the correct length of the year was 365.25 days.

Fotheringham in his article on "The Calendar" observes : 

An **additional day** was inserted at the close of the Egyptian year 23-22 B.C. on August 29 of what we call the Julian calendar, and **at the close of every fourth year** after wards, so that the **reformed or Alexandrian year**, began on August 30 of the Julian calendar in the year preceding à Julian leap year and on August 29 in all other years. The effect of this reform was to keep each Egyptian month fixed to the place in the natural year which it happened to occupy under the old calendar in the years 26-22 B.C. But the old calendar was not easily suppressed, and we find the **two used side by side till A.D. 238 at least**. The **old calendar** was probably the **more popular**, and was preferred by astronomers and astrologers. Ptolemy (150 A.D.) always used it, except in his treatise on annual phenomena, for which the new calendar was obviously more convenient. Theon in the fourth century A.D., though mentioning the old calendar, habitually used the new. 

Though not quite perfect, the Egyptian calendar was greatly admired in antiquity on account of its simplicity, for the length of the year and the months were fixed by definite rules and not by officials or pandits. The **religious observances** fell on **fixed days of the month** and at stated hours, which were **fixed about 1200 B.C**. 

On account of its simplicity, the Egyptian calendar was adopted by many nations of antiquity, and even sometimes by the learned Chaldeans and Greeks, Fotheringham observes : 

"The Egyptian calendar was, upto the time of Julius Caesar's reform of the Roman calendar in 46 B.C., **the only civil calendar** in which the length of each month and of each year was fixed by rule instead of being determined by the discretion of officials or by direct observation. If the number of years between two astronomical observations, dated by the Egyptian calendar, was known, the exact number of days could be determined by a **simple calculation**. No such comparison could be made between dates referred to any other civil calendar unless the computer had access to a record showing the number of days that had actually been assigned to each month and the number of months that had actually been assigned to each year. It is true that the Egyptians **did not use a continuous era**, but were content to number the years of each reign separately, so that there was a difficulty in identifying a particular year, but the astronomers of the Ptolemaic age rectified this by the **introduction of eras**. +++( The Nabonassar Era-vide § 3.4.)+++ The simplicity and regularity of the Egyptian calendar commended it to astronomers, who found it excellently adapted to the construction of tables that could be readily applied and used even for a remote past or for a distant future without any fear that the system by which time was reckoned in the tables might not coincide with the system in actual use. In the second century B.C. we find **Chaldean observations**, sometimes nearly **six centuries old**, **reduced to the Egyptian calendar in the works of Hipparchus** (126 B.C.), who **observed not in Egypt but at Rhodes**, and cited from him by the Egyptian Ptolemy in the second century of our era ; we also find in the second century B.C., **an Athenian observation of 432 B.C. reduced to the Egyptian calendar on an inscription found at Miletus**, which appears to represent the work of the astronomer Epigenes". +++( Article on "The Calendar', Nautical Almanac, 1935.)+++

This calendar survives in a slightly modified form in the Armenian calendar, the three first months of the old Egyptian year corresponding exactly with the three last months of the Armenian year. The Alexandrian calendar is still the calendar of Abyssinia and of the Coptic Church, and is used for agricultural purposes in Egypt and other parts of northern Africa.
