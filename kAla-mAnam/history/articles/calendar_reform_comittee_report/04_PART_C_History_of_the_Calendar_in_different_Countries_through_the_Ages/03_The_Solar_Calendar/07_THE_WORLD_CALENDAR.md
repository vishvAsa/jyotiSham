## Drawbacks of Gregorian calendar
As already stated the Gregorian calendar is a most inconvenient system of time-reckoning. The **days of the months vary** from 28 to 31 ; quarters consist of 90 to 92 days; and the two half years contain 181 and 184 days. The **week-days wander about** the month from year to year, so the year and month beginnings may fall on any week-day, and this causes serious inconvenience to civic and economic activities. The **number of working days per month varies** from 24 to 27, which creates considerable confusion and uncertainty in economic dealings and in the preparation and analysis of statistics and accounts. The present Gregorian calendar is therefore in dire need of reform. 

## Reform attempts
The question of resolving these difficulties had been under consideration for more than the last 100 years. In 1834, the Italian Padre Abbe Mastrofini proposed the Thirteen-Month Calendar, which was strongly advocated by the positivist philosopher August Comte. But this calendar could not attract much attention and consequently it was abandoned. The plan of reform which has received the most favourable comments is, as mentioned earlier, that of the World Calendar Association.


## Motivations
Let us explain the ideas behind this movement : 

### Parellel calendars
Calendars are used for regulating two essentially distinct types of human activities, viz.. 

- (a) Civic and administrative, 
- (b) Social and religious. 

In ancient and medieval times, different countries and religions had developed their characteristic calendars to serve both purposes, but in the modern age due to historic reasons, almost all countries use: 

- (a) the Gregorian calendar for regulation of civic and administrative life, 
- (b) their own characteristic calendars for regulation of social and religious observances.

For example, India uses the Gregorian calendar for civic and administrative purposes, but various luni-solar calendars for fixing up dates for religious festivals of Hindus in different states. The Islamic countries also follow the same practice-Gregorian calendar for civic and administrative purposes, but the lunar calendar for religious purposes. 

Even in Christian countries, which apparently use the Gregorian calendar for both purposes, in actual practice, some additional time-reckonings have to be done for fixing the date of Easter and other holidays which move with it. These reckonings constitute the **ecclesiastic calendar**, and are survival of earlier luni-solar calendars. 

### Disadvantages of the Gregorian calendar
The disadvantages of the Gregorian calendar as used for civic and administrative purposes are: 

- (a) that the years and months begin on different week days, 
- (b) that months are of unequal length from 28 to 31 days and they start on week-days 
which are most changeable. 

This happens because a normal year of 365 days consists of 52 weeks plus one day; and a leap-year coming every fourth year, has 366 days, and consists of 52 weeks plus 2 days. If a normal year begins on a Sunday, the next year will start on Monday, and the year after a leap year will jump two week-days. 

This causes a most undesirable **wandering of the week-day** on which the year begins, as is seen for the next few years. This year 1954, has started on a Friday. We shall have 

- 1955 starting on Saturday 
- 1956 - Sunday 
- 1957 - Tuesday 
- 1958 Wednesday 
- 1959 Thursday 
- 1960 Friday 
- 1961 - Sunday 

How much better it would be for civic and administrative life if a system could be devised that every year should start on a Sunday ? 

## The World Calendar Plan 
This is how the World Calendar Plan proposes to prevent this wandering of the starting-day of the year. It is a very simple device. 

If from 1961, which starts on a Sunday, the last day of the year (6. Dec. 51) which would be under the present system a Sunday, is called the **Worldsday**, that is, no week-day denomination is attached to it, then 1962 also will start on a Sunday, and so will every year till the next leap year 1964. On that year another additional day, the **Leap-Year Day**, is inserted at the end of June, and have the usual Worldsday at the end of the year; then 1965 will also start on a Sunday. 

So, by this simple device of having a Worlds-day at the end of every year and a Leap-Year Day at the end of June every fourth year, both without any week-day denomination, every year can be made to start on a Sunday. This will prove to be an inestimable advantage for the civic life of mankind. 

It is needless to add illustrations of the chaotic way in which the **starting week-days of months** vary. They are chaotic, because lengths of months vary from 28 to 31. There is not the slightest scientific justification for these varying lengths. They are said to have been due to the caprice of two Roman dictators, or some other historical cause not yet clear. How much better it would be for civic purposes, if each month could start on a fixed day of the week? 

The World Calendar plan proposes to put this right by dividing the year into four quarters, each of three months of 31, 30, 30 days' duration. According to this plan, January, April, July, October would have each 31 days, and start on Sunday, February, May, August, November would have each 30 days, and start on Wednesday, March, June, September, December would have 
each 30 days, and start on Friday. If this plan be adopted, the calendar will be perpetual and fool-proof. What a welcome change it would prove when compared to the present chaotic and wandering calendar ? 

### Leap year rule
The year has to conform to the period of the sun, and this is covered by the leap-year rules, amended by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. The leap-year rules introduced by the Iranian poet-astronomer Omar Khayyam in 1079, were more accurate, but less convenient. The Gregorian leap-year rules will cause a mistake of only one day in 3,300 years, which is trivial. 

As regards the duration of months, the World Calendar plan is a marked improvement on the chaotic lengths and starting days of months, inherited from the Julian calendar, which has been tolerated too long. The months of all the quarters are identical and have got 31, 30 & 30 days, commencing on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays respectively. Each month has thus got exactly 26 working days. It has retained the present 12 months, thus the four quarters are always equal, each quarter has 3 months or 13 weeks or 91 days beginning on Sunday and ending with Saturday.

## Objections
The objections to the World Calendar plan come from several Jewish organizations, on the ground that the World Calendar plan interferes with the unbroken seven-day week, by introducing Worlds day and Leap-year. Day without any week-day denomination. This, they say, will interfere with their religious life. 

As already shown, the religious sanction for the seven-day cycle is either non-existent, or slight, amongst communities other than the Jews, and even amongst them, it dates only from the first century A. D. The claims of certain Jewish Rabbis to prove that the seven-day week cycle has been ordained by God Almighty from the moment of creation which event, according to these Jewish Rabbis, took place on the day of the autumnal equinox, also a new moon day, is a fantastic conception of medieval scholars, which no sane man can entertain in these days of Darwin and Einstein. 

The World Calendar plan has no intention of interfering with the characteristic calendars of communities or nations. They can exist side by side with the World Calendar. For such communities as intend to maintain the continuous seven-day week, their religious week-days, including Sundays, would no doubt wander through the World Calendar week days, and cause some inconvenience to the very small fraction of people who would want to observe their religious rites according to established usage.

But these inconveniences can be adjusted by agreement, and it would be egoistical on the part of a particular community or communities to try to impede the passage of a measure of such great usefulness to the whole of mankind on the plea that the World Calendar plan interferes with the continuous seven-day week. Calendars are based on Science, which everybody must bow to ; and on Convention, which may be altered by mutual consent. The unbroken seven-day week is a Convention, but the World Calendar plan bas proposed a far better Convention, which should be examined on its own merits.\*

As a result of a request from the Government of India, the proposal of the World Calendar Reform had become the subject of discussion at the eighteenth session of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations held at Geneva during June-July, 1954. Professor M. N. Saha, F. R. S., Chairman, Calendar Reform Committee, attended the ECOSOC meeting at Geneva to explain the desirability of the proposed reform. 

## Summary
In this Improved Calendar : 
- Every year is the same. 
- The quarters are equal : each quarter has exactly 91 days, 13 weeks or 3 months ; the four quarters are identical in form. 
- Each month has 26 weekdays, plus Sundays. 
- Each year begins on Sunday, 1 January ; each working year begins on Monday, 2 January. Each quarter begins on Sunday, ends on Saturday. 
- The calendar is stabilized and perpetual, by ending the year with a 365th day that follows 30 December each year, called Worldsday dated “W” or 31 December, a year-end world holiday. Leap-year day is similarly added at the end of the second quarter, called Leapyear Day dated “W” or 31 June, another world holiday in leap years..
