## Solar calendars

In the following sections, the different ways of tackling the calendar problem in different centres of civilization have been described. We have described in Chap. II, the **purely solar calendars**, in which the moon is altogether discarded as a time-marker. This practice originated in Egypt about 3000 B.C. These calendars require only a correct knowledge of the length of year, and are therefore comparatively simpler. They required very little or **almost no knowledge of astronomy**. 

## Luni-Solar calendars

We have described in Chap. III, the luni-solar calendars, prevalent in ancient Mesopotamia, India, China and most other countries. In these calendars, both the sun and the moon are used as time-markers, and therefore precise knowledge of their motion in the heavens was essential for the formulation of a correct calendar. We mark **two stages** ; first the formulation of a calendar from a knowledge of only the length of the year, and of the **mean lunar month**. This was an older phase. It did not work satisfactorily, because it depended on the mean motion of the two luminaries. Actually, the time-predictions have to be verified by actual comparison of the predicted happenings (say of the vernal equinox day in the case of the sun, or the first appearance of the crescent of the moon after new moon on the western horizon) with the time of actual happenings. This gave rise to the need for watching the daily motion of the two luminaries, and invention of methods for recording and storing these observations ; in other words, this led to the science of astronomy. **Early astronomy is almost completely calendarical**. At a later stage, the five planets attracted attention, on account of their association with astrology. 

## Further chapters

We have therefore devoted Chap. IV to **calendaric astronomy**, which was evolved by the Chaldeans, and taken over from them by the Greeks, and in time diffused to other countries. 

In Chap. V, we have described the various stages of the development of the **Indian calendar** :--the **empirical stage** (Rg-Vedic), the **mean motion stage** (Vedānga Jyōtiṣa), and the **scientific stage** (Siddhānta Jyotiṣa). From 1200 A.D., astronomical studies became decadent in India, and we have analysed the **cause of decadence**. We have given a **full account of precession**, as most Indian calendar makers still believe in the false theory of **Trepidation** which disappeared from Europe after 1687 A. D.
