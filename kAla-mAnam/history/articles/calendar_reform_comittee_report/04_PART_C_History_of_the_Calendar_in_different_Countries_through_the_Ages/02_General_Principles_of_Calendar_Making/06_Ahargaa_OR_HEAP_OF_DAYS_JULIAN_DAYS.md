## Ambiguity in calendar dates

Though the Flux of Time is a continuous process, it is divided for the sake of convenience and for natural reasons too, into years, months and days. The years are mostly counted from the beginning of an era, so that if we wish to date a memorable event, say the birth day of George Washington, it can be seen from an inspection of his birth register that it took place on Feb.11, of the year 1732. But this practice by itself does not enable a scientific chronologist to fix up the event unambiguously on the absolute Scale of Time, unless the whole history of the particular method of date-recording is completely and accurately known. One must know the lengths of the individual months, the leap-year rules, and the history of calendar reform. In the particular case mentioned, though George Washington. according to his birth register is stated to have been **born on Feb. 11, 1732, his birth-day is celebrated on Feb. 22**. Why? Because Feb. 11 was the date according to the Julian calendar. But in 1752, England (America was then a colony of England) adopted the reformed Gregorian calendar, and by an Act of Parliament, declared Sept. 3 to be Sept.14, a difference of 11. days. Following the Gregorian calendar, Washington's birth-day had to be shifted to Feb. 22. A scientific chronologist, say of China, would find it **difficult to locate Washington's birth-day unless he knew the whole history of the Gregorian calendar**. 

This difficulty is more pronounced when we have to deal a **luni-solar calendar**, say that of Babylon. Many records of lunar eclipses occuring in Babylon were known to the Alexandrian astronomer, **Claudius Ptolemy**, but they were dated in **Seleucidean era**, and **Babylonian months**, say year 179, 10th of Nisan. Now the Babylonian months were lunar, had lengths of 29 or 30 days, but the year could have lengths of 353, 354 383, 384 ( vide § 33.). Therefore when two eclipse datings were compared, it was impossible to calculate the number of days between them, unless the investigator had before him a record showing the lengths of years and months between the two events. Ptolemy expressed his datings according to the **Egyptian calendar**, which enables one to calculate the interval far more easily. He must have taken lot of pains to carry out the conversion from the Babylonian to Egyptian dates. 

How much better it would have been if a great genius at the beginning of civilization, say near about 3000 B.C., started with a zero day, and started the practice of dating events by the number of days elapsed since this zero date, to the date when this particular event took place. Such a great genius did not appear and a confusing number of calendars came into existence. The scientific chronologist is now faced with the reverse problem : Suppose two ancient or medieval events are found dated according to two different calendars. How to reduce these dates to an absolute chronological scale ? 

## Julian days

For this purposer a medieval French scholar, Joseph Scaliger introduced in 1582 A.D., a system known as 'Julian Days' after his father, Julius Scaliger. The Julian period in years is `7980 years - 19x 28 x 15` 
-19 being the length in years of the Metonic Cycle +++(rough period when phases of the moon recur on the same day of the tropical year)+++, 

- 15 being the length in years of the Cycle of Indiction +++(= proclamation made every 15 years in the later Roman Empire, fixing the valuation of property to be used as a basis for taxation)+++, and 
- 28 being the length in years of the +++(old Julian calendar)+++ Solar Cycle +++(when weekdays repeat as (365*28+7)/7 is a whole number)+++. 

It was found by calculation that these three cycles started together on Jan. 1, 4713 B.C. So the Julian, period as well as the Julian day numbers started from that date. The Julian period is intended to include all dates both in the past and in the future to which reference is likely to be made and to that extent it has an advantage over an era whose epoch lies within the limits of historical time. The years of the Julian period are seldom employed now, but the day of the Julian period is frequently used in astronomy and calendaric tables. Unlike the civil day, the Julian day. number is completed at noon. 

Let us give the Julian days for a number of world events, as given by Ginzel, in his Handbuch der Mathe matischenund Technischen Chronologie.

- Hejira ... 16 July, 622 A.D. 1,948,440 
- Jezdegerd (Persian) ... 16 June, 632 A.D. 1,952,063 
- Burmese era ... 21 March, 638 A.D. 1,954,167

- Jelali (Iran) era ... 15 March, 1079 A.D. 2,115,236  

It may be mentioned here that the ideas underlying continuous reckoning of days occurred much earlier to the celebrated Indian astronomer, Aryabhaṭa I (476 525 A.D.), who introduced it under the designation "Ahargaṇa" or heap of days in his celebrated Aryabhaṭīya. The idea of counting Ahargaṇa or heaps of days elapsed from a specified epoch upto the given date dawned upon the Hindu astronomers as a necessity for calculating the position of planets for that date. They followed the cumbrous luni-solar calendar for dating purposes, which was not based upon any simple rules. It contains months of 29 or 30 days, and occasionally a thirteenth month, the recurrence of which was determined by elaborate methods. The dates of the months are not numbered serially, but designated by the tithi current at sunrise. It was accordingly found almost impossible to work out the mean positions of planets on the basis of the luni-solar calendar alone. 

For this purpose a continuous and uniform time scale was necessary, and this was served by the Ahargaṇa. 

## Mahāyuga epoch

Aryabhaṭa had somehow the idea that the planets, and the two nodes (which were treated as planets in Hindu astronomy) return to the first point of Aries after every 4.32 x 10⁶ years, and there was a unique assemblage of planets at the first point of the Hindu sphere at some past date which he called the beginning of **Kali Yuga**. The date assigned to the Kali beginning is now known to be **3102 B.C., February 17-18**. The common period of revolution of planets of 4.32 x 10⁶ years constitute a **Mahāyuga** consiting of 

- Satya yuga of 1.728 x 10⁶ years 
- Tretā yuga of 1.296 x 10⁶ years 
- Dvāpara yuga of 0.864 x 10⁶ years 
- Kali yuga of 0.432 x 10⁶ years 
- Total 4.32 x 10⁶ years. 

It may be noticed that 4.32 x 10⁶ = 12000 x 360 

Aryabhaṭa gave tables showing the number of sidereal revolutions of planets in the period of 4.32 x 100 years. The total number of days in a Mahāyuga=1,577,917,800 which gives the length of a year=365.25875 days. 

Brahmagupta was evidently not satisfied that Aryabhaṭa's figures for the periods of planets were correct. He introduced a **Kalpa**=1000 Mahāyugas= 4.32 x 10⁹ years. The 'Kalpa' was supposed to constitute a 'Day' of the Creator, Grand-father Brahma. He gave the number of sidereal revolutions of the planets in a Kalpa, and thought he had improved Aryabhața's figure for the year.

Brahmagupta's year=365.25844 days.

Aryabhaṭa calculated 'Ahargaṇa' or heap of days, from the beginning of the Mahāyuga as the zero-day.

## Later ahargaṇa epochs

But evidently this practice involves very large numbers; and is inconvenient to use. Therefore the later astronomers used modifications of the system by counting Ahargaṇa from other convenient epochs, within historical reach. The different epochs which have been used are :-- 

- (1) The beginning of the Kali era or 3102 B.C. 
- (2) 427 Śaka era or 505 A.D. as is found in Pancasiddhāntikā of Varahamihira. 
- (3) 587 Śaka era or 665 A.D. as is found in the Khandakhadyaka of Brahmagupta. 
- (4) 854 śaka era or 932. A.D, as is found in the Laghumānasa of Munjāla. 
- (5) 961 Śaka era or 1039 A.D. in the Siddhānta-śekhara of śrīpati. 

The astronomical treatises of the Hindus have been divided into three categories according to the initial epoch employed for calculation. In which the calculations of Ahargaṇa as well as the planetary mean places are made from the Kalpa, is called a **Siddhānta** ; when the calculations start from a Mahāyuga or Kali beginning it is called a **Tantra**, and when it is done from a recent epoch it is called a **Karaṇa**. In any case, the mean places of the planets with their nodes and apsides are given for the epoch of the treatise from which calculations are to be started, with rules for finding the ahargaṇa for any later date. This Ahargaṇa is then made use of in finding for that later date the positions of planets from their given initial positions and their daily motions, for, 

The mean position at any epoch = the mean position at the initial epoch + daily motion x Ahargaṇa. 

Due to the complexity of the Hindu luni-solar calendar, one has to go through complicated rules in determining the Ahargaṇa for any particular day. Dr. Olaf Schmidt of the Brown University and the Institute of Advanced Study, in discussing the method of computation of the Ahargaṇa at length, has pointed out that the present Hindu method suffers from a disturbing discontinuity. The curious reader may go through his article published in the Centaurus. 

We, however, give below the corresponding Julian day numbers and Kali Ahargaṇa for certain modern dates. 

- date, Julian days (elapsed at mean noon),  Kali Ahargaṇa (elapsed at following midnight)
- 1900, Jan. 1 -  2,415,021 - 1,826,556
- 1947, Aug. 15 - 2,432,413 -  1,843,948
- 1956, Mar. 21 - 2,435,554 - 1,847,089 

The difference between the two numbers 588,465. represents the Julian day number on the Kali epoch, as already stated. 

The use of Ahargaṇa plays a very important part in modern epigraphical researches when the date recorded in an inscription is required to be converted into the corresponding date of the Julian calendar. If the Kali Ahargaṇa for the recorded date can be determined, then the problem of ascertaining the corresponding Julian or Gregorian date becomes a very easy task.
