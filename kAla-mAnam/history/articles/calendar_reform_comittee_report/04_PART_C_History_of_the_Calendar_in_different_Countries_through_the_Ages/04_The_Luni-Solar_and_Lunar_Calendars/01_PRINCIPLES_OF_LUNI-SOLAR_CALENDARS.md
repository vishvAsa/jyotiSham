The Egyptians appear to have been the only cultural nation of antiquity who discarded the moon entirely as a time-marker. Other contemporaneous cultural nations, e.g. the Sumero-Akkadians of Babylon, and the Vedic Indians retained both the sun and the moon as time-markers, the **sun for the year, the moon for the month**. 

The Indian astronomers called the **moon māsakrt**, (month-maker) and before the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa time, the moon was considered more important as a time marker than the sun (vide §5). It was the same with other nations too, for as Pannekoek remarks, we find the opinion written in the sacred books of many nations "For regulating time, the moon has been created". 

The retention of both the sun and the moon, however, gives rise to a multitude of problems, of which a fair summary is given by Pannekoek as follows,* 

"With all peoples of antiquity, the Indians, Babylonians, Jews, Greeks, we find the moon-calendar used ; the period of the moon, the regular sequence of the first appearance of the fine crescent moon in the evening sky, its growth to first quarter, to full moon, at the same time coming up later and filling the whole night, then the decrease to last quarter till its disappearance after the last thin crescent before sunrise was seen, — this regular cycle of the moon's phases in the period of 294 days was everywhere the first basis of chronology". 

"But the calendar could not be satisfactorily fixed with the establishment of the moon-cycle. In these ancient times, the people, the tribe, and the state was a political, spiritual and religious unity. Important events of society, the great agricultural performances, the beginning of the ploughing, the sowing or the harvesting were great popular festivals and at the same time chief religious ceremonies, when offerings were presented to the gods. The moon calendar had to adapt itself to the economic life of the people, which was governed by the cycle of seasons. Thus arose the practical problem of adapting the moon-period of 29.7 days to the solar year of 365 days. This chief problem of ancient chronology has been a mighty impulse to the study of astronomy, because it necessitated continuous observation of the sky."

**Twelve lunar months** of 29.4 days each, making a total of **354 days**, fall nearly 11 days short of the solar year. In the next year, the beginning of each month occurs 11 days earlier, in three years 33 days will be lost.\* To fix the same month to the same season always, there are no other means than after two or three years to **intercalate a Thirteenth Month**, number 13, by repeating the last month of the year. 

\* The mean duration of a lunar month consists of **29.530588 days** and twelve such lunations amount to **354.36706 days**, while the length of a tropical solar year is 365.24220 days. The length of a lunar year thus falls short of the solar year by 10.87514 days, and instead of there being exactly twelve lunar months in a year, there are 12.36827 months. 

The luni-solar adjustment, which is next taken up, is the first step to the solution of problems stated by Pannekoek; but it is not however the whole solution, for it leaves untouched the problem of correct prediction of the day when the crescent of the moon first appears after new moon in the western horizon. This will be taken up later (vide 84). 

Luni-solar adjustment can be satisfactorily made if we have accurate knowledge of the length of the tropical year, and of the mean length of the lunation. Let us see how these fundamental periods were determined in ancient times. 

## Length of Seasons and the Year 

The length of the year was obtained in Egypt, as we have already seen, from the recurrence of the Nile flood. In Babylonia, no such striking natural phenomena were available. It is very probable that the **Babylonians** early learnt the **use of the gnomon**, with the aid of which they could determine the cardinal days of the year : viz., the summer and winter solstices, and the two equinoxes coming in between. 

The lengths of the seasons were found by counting the number of days from one cardinal day to the next. The number may vary by one day from year to year, and astronomers must have 'realized that the correct length of a season was not a whole number but was fractional. Probably the correct length was found by taking a large number of observations, and taking the mean. The following table shows the length of the seasons and of the year as found by ancient astronomers. 

Table 2. Showing the length of seasons. 

- Spring Summer Autumn Winter
- Euctemon (432 B.C.) 93 90 90 92 = 365
- Calippos (370 B.C.) 94 92 89 92 = 365
- Chaldean (200 B.C.) 94.5 92.73 88.59 91.29 = 365.26
- Correct values for 1384 B.C.  94.09 91.29 88.58 91.29 = 365.25

The length of the year was also found by the same method. The **solar year** is the period between successive transitions of the sun through the same cardinal point. Neugebauer thinks that summer solstice was first used for this purpose in ancient times. But subsequently evidences are found of the use of other cardinal points. 

Thus we find that during the classical period in **Babylon**, the solar year started with the **vernal equinox**. But the **Macedonian Greeks and the Jews** started with the **autumnal equinox**. The **west European countries** appear to have started the solar year with the **winter solstice**.

The number of days in a solar year would vary between 365 and 366. Probably the exact length was determined by counting the number of days between the year-beginnings separated by a large number of years and taking the mean. The Indian practice, followed in the Siddhāntas, is to give the number of days in a Kalpa (a period of 4.32x 10⁹ years) from which one can find out the number of days in a year by simple division. This appears in modern times to be a rather cumbrous practice, but is probably reminiscent of taking the **mean for a large number of years**. 

In ancient times, people had not learnt to follow the motion of the sun in the starry heavens, so they were unaware of the **difference between the sidereal year and the tropical year**. But from their method of measurement, they unconsciously chose the correct, or the tropical year. 

Modern measurements show that the length of the **tropical year is not constant**, but is slowly varying. It is becoming shorter at the rate of .0001 days or 86 secs. in 1600 years. 

So that in Sumerian times, the tropical year had a length of 365.2425 days. The present length is 365.2422 days.
