The Mohammedan calendar is **purely lunar** and has no connection with the solar year. The year consists of 12 lunar months, the beginning of each month being determined by the first observation of the crescent moon in the evening sky. The months have accordingly got 29 or 30 days and the **year 354 or 355 days**. The **new-year day** of the Mohammedan calendar thus retrogrades through the seasons and **completes the cycle in a period of about 324 solar years**. 

The era of the Mohammedan calendar, viz., the Hejira (A.H.), which was probably introduced by the **Caliph Umar about 638-639 A.D.**, started from the **evening of 622 A.D., July 15, Thursday**, when the crescent moon of the first month Muharram of the Mohammedan calendar was first visible. This was the new-year day preceding the emigration of Muhammad from Mecca which took place about Sept. 20 (8 Rabi I), 622 A.D. 


As the **day** of the Islamic calendar **commences from sunset**, **Friday** started from the evening of that day. 


For astronomical and chronological purposes the lengths of the months are however fixed by rule and not by observation. The lengths of the months in days for this purpose are as follows: 

- Muharram 30
- Safar 29
- Rabi-ul awwal 30 
- Rabi-us sani 29
- Jamada'l awwal ....... 30 
- Jamada-s sani 29
- Rajab  30
- Shaban 29
- Ramadan  30
- Shawal ....29 
- Zilkada . ......30 
- Zilhijja . ......29 (or 30) 

The **leap-year**, in which Zilhijja has one day more, contains 355 days and is known as Kabishah. In a cycle of 30 years, there are 19 common years of 354 days and 11 leap-years of 355 days. Thus 360 lunations are made equivalent to 10,631 days or only :012 days less than its actual duration. The rule for determining the leap year of this fixed 'calendar is that, if after dividing the Hejira year by 30, the remainder is 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26 or 29, then it is á leāp-year. 

The only purely lunar calendar is the Islamic Calendar, which has been in vogue amongst the followers of Islam since the death of the Prophet Muhammad (632 A.D). But it is well-known that **before this period Mecca observed some kind of luni solar calendar** in common with all countries of the Near East. The common story is that when pilgrims from distant countries and other parts of Arabia came to perform Hajj at Mecca (**Hajj** is a pre-Islamic practice), they often found that it was an intercalary month according to Meccan calculation, when no religious festival could be performed, and had to wait for a month before they were allowed to perform the rites. This meant great **hardships for distant visitors** and to prevent recurrence of such incidents the **Prophet forbade the use of intercalary or 13th month** and decreed that the calendar should henceforth be purely lunar. 

It has now been shown by Dr. Hashim Amir Ali of the Osmania University, Hyderabad, that the Mohammedan calendar was originally luni-solar in which intercalation was made when necessary, and not purely lunar. This view-point has now been strongly supported by Mohammed Ajmal Khan of the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India. They emphasize that upto the last year of the life of Mohammed, i.e., upto A.H. 10 or A.D. 632, a thirteenth month was intercalated when necessary. The Arabs, among whom there were relatively few men conversant with astronomical calculations, had a system in which a family of astronomers, known as **Qalammas** was responsible for proclaiming at the Hajj (falling in the last month of the year : Zilhijja) that a thirteenth month would or would not be added. Astronomically such intercalation should be made **3 times in 8 years or 7 times in 19 years**. The elder of the Qalamma had a certain amount of discretion in determining when this intercalation was to be practised, and this very practice afterwards caused great confusion.

According to this view, proper intercalation was applied in all the years where necessary upto A.H. 10 and consequently the year A.H. 11 (coming next to the Hajj of A.H. 10) which started on March 29, 632 A.D. (i.e., after the vernal equinox day) seems to have been a rather normal year, and as such all the previous new-year days appear to have been celebrated on the visibility of the crescent moon after the veral equinox day. The Muslim months should accordingly occupy permanent places in the seasons as follows\* : 

- Muharram... Mar.-April 
- Rajab ... Sept.-Oct. 
- Safar... ... April-May 
- Shaban ... Oct.—Nov. 
- Rabi I ... May - June 
- Ramadan ...Nov.-Dec. 
- Rabi II ... June — July 
- Shawal ... Dec.-Jan. 
- Jamadi I ... July --Aug. 
- Zilkada ... Jan. - Feb. 
- Jamadi II ... Aug. Sept. 
- Zilhijja ...Feb. -Mar. 

\* If this view is accepted, it would then be necessary to shift the starting epoch of the Hejira era, which is commonly accepted as July 16, 622 A.D., to an earlier date, ag 4 intercalary months or 118 days will then have to be inserted between the new-year days of A.H. 1 and of A.H. 11, which is March 29, 632 A.D. The initial epoch of the Hejira era thus arrived at is the evening of March 19, 622 A.D., Friday, the day following the vernal equinox.
