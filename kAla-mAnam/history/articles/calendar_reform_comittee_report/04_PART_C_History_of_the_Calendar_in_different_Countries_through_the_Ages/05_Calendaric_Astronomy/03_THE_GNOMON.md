title = "03 THE GNOMON"

+++
Observations of the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and stars are now made very accurately with elaborate instruments installed in observatories. But these instruments have been evolved after thousands of years of experience and application of human ingenuity, and have undergone radical changes in design and set-up with every great technological discovery. But let us see how the early astronomers who had no instruments or very primitive ones made observations, collected the fundamental data, and evolved the basic astronomical ideas. 

The earliest instrument used-by primitive astrono mers appears to have been the gnomon; which we now describe.

The ancients determined the latitude of the place, obliquity of the ecliptic, the length of the year and the time of day by measuring the length and direction of shadow of the gnomon, The figure shows the noon-shadow of the gnomon AB, AE being the equinoctial shadow and AC and AD the shadow on two solstice-days, at a place on latitude = Φ. 

Nobody can fail to see the change in direction and length of shadows of vertical objects throughout the day-time, and throughout the year. When these observations are carefully made, by means of the gnomon ( śaṅku in Sanskrit ), which is simply a vertical stick planted into the ground, and standing on fairly level ground of large area, without obstruc- tions from any direction, a good deal of astronomical knowledge can be easily deduced. These observations appear to have been made in all ancient countries. 

We have the following description, by George Sarton, of observations made in ancient times in Greece with the aid of the gnomon. (George Barton: A History of Science, p. 174. CALENDARIC ASTRONOMY)

"It (the gromon) is simply a stick or a pole planted vertically in the gror or one might use a column built for that purpose or for any other ; the Egyptian obelisks would have been perfect gnomons if sufficiently isolated from other buildings. Any intelligent person, having driven his spear into the sand, might have noticed that its shadow turned around during the day and that it varied in length as it turned. The gnomon in its simplest form was the systematization of that casual experiment. Instead of a spear, a measured stick was established solidly in a vertical position in the middle of a horizontal plane, well smoothed out and unobstructed all around in order that the shadow could be seen clearly from sunup to sundown. The astronomer (the systematic user of the gnomon deserves that name) observing the shadow throughout the year would see that it reached a minimum every day (real noon), and that minimum varied from day to day, being shortest at one time of the year (summer solstice) and longest six months later (winter solstice). Moreover, the direction of the shadow turned around from West to East during each day, describing a fan the amplitude of which varied througout the year".\* 

\* Sarton mentions Anaximander (C. 610-545 B.C.) of Miletus as the earliest Ionian philosopher who used the gnomon in Greater Greece. 

From the observation of the shadows cast by the gnomon, many useful deductions could be made. These are : 

- (1) Mark the points in the morning and in the evening when the shadows are equal in length and draw the lines showing the shadows. Then bisect the angle between the two shadow lines. This gives us the meridian or the north-south direction of the place.. 
  - The process of bisection was done by taking a rope attaching extreme points to the end points of the equal shadows ; then take the mid-point of the rope, and stretch the rope, and mark the position of the mid-point. This connected to the pole gives us the meridian line. If we draw a circle, with the pole as centre, and draw the meridian, the point where it strikes the northern semi-circle is the North point, opposite is the South point. The East and West points are found by drawing a line at right angles to the north-south direction. So the cardinal directions are found. 
- (2) Observe the position of the sunrise from day to day. If observations are carried on throughout the year, there will be found two days in the year when the sun will arise exactly on the east point. Then it is found that the day and night are equal in length. These days are called the Equinoctial days. Let us start from the equinoctial day in Spring (vernal equinox). This happens on March 21st. Then we observe that the sun at sunrise is steadily moving to the north, at first rapidly, then more slowly. Near the extreme north, the sun's movement is very slow, so this point is called the Solstice which means the sun standing still. Actually the sun reaches its northern-most point on June 22 (summer solstice). The day is longest on this date. Then the sun begins to move south till it crosses the east point on September 23, when day and night again become equal (the autum nal equinox day). It continues to move south, till the extreme south is reached on December 22, (the winter solstice day), when daylight is shortest for places on the northern hemisphere. Then the sun turns back towards the east point reaching it on March 21, and the year-cycle is complete.. 

The gnomon thus enabled the ancient astronomers (in Babylon, India, Greece, and China) to determine : 

- (a) The **Cardinal points** : East, North, West, and South ; the north-south line is the meridian line (the Yamyottara-rekha in Indian astonomy); 
-(b) The **Cardinal days** of the Year : viz., 
  - The Vernal Equinox (V.E.) day, when day and night are equal.
  - The Summer Solstice (S.S.) day, when the day is the longest for observers on the northern hemisphere. 
  - The Autumnal Equinox (A.E.) day, when day and night are again equal. 
  - The Winter Solstice (W.S.) day, when the day is the shortest for observers on the northern hemisphere. All early astronomical work was done in the northern hemisphere. 
  - These methods are fully described in the Surya Siddhānta, Chap. III, but they appear to have been practised from far more ancient times. In the appendix (5-C), we have quoted passages from the **Aitareya Brāhmaṇa** which shows that the gnomon was used to determine the **cardinal days of the year** at the time when this ritualistic book was compiled. The date is at least 600 B.C., i.e., before India had the Greek contact. It may be considerably older even. 
- (c) To mark out the **Seasons** : We have mentioned earlier that in countries other than Egypt, there were no impressive physical phenomenon like the arrival of the annual flood of the Nile to mark the beginning of the solar year, or of the seasons. The seasons pass imperceptibly from the one to the other. 

The gnomon observations probably enabled the early astronomers of Babylon and Greece to define the onset of the seasons, and the length of the year with greater precision. 

In Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, we have four seasons : 

- Spring ... from V.E. to S.S. 
- Summer... .. SS. to A.E. 
- Autumn...... A.E. to W.S. 
- Winter. ... W.S. to V.E. 

Thus, every season starts immediately after a cardinal day of the year and ends on the next cardinal day. 

According to Neugebauer : 

"Babylonian astronomy (during Seleucid periods, 300 B.C.- 75 A.D. ) was satisfied with an exact four-division of the seasons as far as solstices and equinoxes are concerned, with the summer solstice ( and not the vernal point ) as the fixed point."\* 

\* Neugebauer : Babylonian Planetary Theory, Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc. Vol. 98 : 1, 1954, p. 64. 

At a later stage, they however found that the four seasons had unequal lengths ( vide $ 3.1). 

The above definition of 'seasons' has come down to modern astronomy. The Hindu definition of seasons was different ( vide § 5.6 and 5-A) 

The observation of the Cardinal days of the year appear to have been carried out all over the ancient world by other methods, and often in a far more elaborate manner. People would observe the day-to-day rise of the sun on the eastern horizon, and mark out the days when the sun was farthest north (summer solstice day), or farthest south (winter solstice day). The time period taken by the sun to pass from the southern solstitial point to the northern solstitial point was known in the Vedas as the Uttarāyana (northern passage), and that taken by the sun to pass from the northern solstitial point to the southern solstitial point was known as the Dakṣiṇāyana (southern passage). Exactly midway between these points the sun rises on the vernal and autumnal equinoctial days. From the passage in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, quoted later ( vide §5:3), we see clearly that the point on the eastern horizon, where the sun rose on these days, was recognized to be the true east. 

Doubt has been expressed about the ability of Vedic Aryans to make these observations, but to these objections, B. G. Tilak replied in his Orion, pp. 16-17. 

“Prof. Weber and Dr. Schrader appear to doubt the conclusion on the sole ground that we cannot suppose the primitive Aryans to have so far advanced in civilization as to correctly comprehend such problems. This means that we must refuse to draw legitimate inferences from plain facts when such inferences conflict with our preconceived notions about the primitive Aryan civilization. I am not disposed to follow this method, nor do I think that people, who knew and worked in metals, made clothing of wool, constructed boats, built houses and chariots, performed sacrifices, and had made some advance in agriculture, were incapable of ascertaining the solar and the lunar years. They could not have determined it correct to a fraction of a second as modern astronomers have done ; but a rough practical estimate was, certainly, not beyond their powers of comprehension." 

The best example of the ability of the ancient people to observe the cardinal points of the sun's motion is afforded by the **Stonehenge** in the Salisbury plains of England, of which detailed accounts have recently appeared in Scientific American ( 188, 6-25, 1953 ) and Discovery (1953, Vol. XIV, p.276). 

It is related in these two publications, that not a long time subsequent to 1800 B.C., say about 1500-1200 B.C., the then inhabitants of Britain, who had not even learnt the use of any metal, but used only stone implements, could construct a huge circular area enclosed by large upright monoliths forming lintels and with a horse-shoe shaped central area having its axis in the direction of sunrise on the summer solstice day. It has been proyed, almost beyond any doubt, that the Stonehenge was used for the ceremonial observation of sunrise on this day. Sir Norman Lockyer in 1900 found that the direction of the axis of the **horse-shoe** actually makes an angle of about 11° with the present **direction of sunrise on the summer solstice day**. He did not think that it was a mistake on the part of the original builders ; but that on account of the change in obliquity (angle between equator and ecliptic), the present direction of sunrise had changed to the extent of 11° and using the rate of change of obliquity, **he could fix up the time of construction at 1800 + 200 B.C.** This estimate has been brilliantly confirmed by **C14-analysis** of some wood charcoal found in the local burial pits which are presumed to be contemporary with the erection of the Stonehenge. 

After this brilliant confirmation of Lockyer's hypothesis, it is hoped that there will be less hesitation on the part of scholars to admit that it was possible for the Vedic Aryans who knew the use of metal and were far more advanced than the stone-age people of Britain, to devise methods for the observation of the cardinal points of the year. 

How did they observe these points ? Probably in the same way as the Britishers of 1500 B.C., by observing from a central place, the directions of sunrise on the eastern horizon throughout the year. The directions of the solstitial rises could be easily marked. Probably the equinoctial points were found by bisecting the angle between these two directions by means of ropes as described in the Sulva-Sūtras.
