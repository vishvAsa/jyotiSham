title = "01 THE MOON'S MOVEMENT IN THE SKY"

+++

The scheme of lunar months given in Table No. 4 in a nineteen-year period, which came into vogue in Babylon about 383 B.C. did not, however, completely satisfy the needs of the Babylonian calendar, because for religious purposes, the month was to start on the day the crescent moon was first visible in the western horizon after conjunction with the sun (the new moon), a custom which is still followed in the Islamic countries. But the first visibility may not occur on the predicted day for manifold reasons. 

The table given on p. 176 is based on mean values of the of the lengths of the year and the synodic month, which is equivalent to the assumption that the sun and the moon move uniformly in the same great circle in the heavens. But even the most primitive observers could not fail to notice that neither do the two luminaries move in the same path, nor do they move uniformly, each in its own path. 

The motion of the moon amongst the stars is the easiest to observe. This is illustrated in the two figures reproduced from the Sky and Telescope, giving positions of the moon, the sun, and the planets in the field of fixed stars in the months of June and July, 1953.

The central horizontal line is the line of the celestial equator (§ 4.4), and the sinuous line represents the ecliptic or the sun's path (8 4.5), but we may ignore these now, and simply concentrate on the moon and the stars or star-clusters near which it passes. 

The moon begins as a thin crescent on the western horizon on the evening of June 12, the day of the first visibility after the new-moon, at an angle of 11°, from the sun which has just set, below the bright stars Castor and Pollux (Punarvasū). Then we notice the position of the moon, on successive evenings at sunset: We find she is moving eastward at the rate of about 13° and becoming fuller (increasing in phase). She passes the bright star Regulus (Magha) on the 17th, on the 19th, she is half and passes B Leonis (Uttara Phalguni) leaving it a good deal to the north. Then she passes the bright star Spica ( α Virginis or Citra) on the 21st, and is then gibbous on the 23rd near the star a-libra (Visakha). Then she passes the well known Scorpion-cluster and becomes full on the 27th, near a star-cluster which cannot be seen on the night of full-moon, but can be detected later as the star cluster Sagittarius. On the full moon day, she rises nearly at sunset, at 180° from the sun (opposition). On each successive night after full moon she rises later and later, and passes the phases in the reverse order, i.e., becomes gibbous+++(=convex)+++ on June 30, when she has the bright star Altair (Śravaṇa) far to the north and is half on July 4, and becomes a crescent on July 7 on the eastern sky, and then fails to appear for three days, and must have passed the sun on the 11th July which is the new moon day, when she is with the sun (Amārasyā or conjunction, lit. the sun and the moon living together). On the 12th July, she reappears on the western horizon as a thin crescent, near the star ó-Cancri (Puṣya), and the cycle again starts. 

The crescent of the moon, either in the western or the eastern sky, is always turned away from the sun. 

The ancients must have observed the motion of the moon day after day, from new-moon to new-moon (a full lunation or lunar month) and become familiar with the stars or star-clusters which she passes. It is always easy to observe them when the moon is a crescent ; when the moon becomes fuller, the stars are lost in the moon's glare particularly if they are faint. But if observations be carried on for a number of years, the observers would become familiar with all the stars or star-clusters which the moon passes. 

By observations like this, the ancients must have found that both the moon and the sun are moving to the east, the moon very fast, the sun more slowly. By the time the moon, after making a whole round, comes back to the sun, the latter has moved further to the east by about 30°. For example in the above figures Nos. 2 and 3, the sun was somewhat to the west of the bright star-group Orionis (Mrgasiras) to the west of Castor and Pollux on June 11th, the day of the new moon. But on the next new-moon day, July 11th, she has moved near Castor and Pollux (Punarvasū) about 30° to the east. 

The ancients must have found that the moon takes a little over 27.3 days (sidereal period of the moon), to return to the same star, but to overtake the sun, it takes a little longer, a little over 29.5 days (the synodic period of the moon). Exactly, 

the mean sidereal period=27.321661 days = 27d 7h 43m 118s5 with a variation of 3.5 hours and the mean synodic period =29.530588 days = 29d 12h 44m 2s. with a variation of 7 hours. 

## The Lunar Mansions
Many ancient nations developed the habit of designating the day-to-day (or night-to-night) position of the moon by the stars or star-clusters it passed on successive nights. The number of such stars or star clusters was either 27 or 28 ; the ambiguity was due to the fact that the mean sidereal period of the moon is about 27.5 days, the actual period having a variation of seven hours, and the ancients who did not know how to deal with fractions, oscillated between 27 and 28. In India, originally there were 28 nakṣatras, but ultimately 27 was accepted as the number of lunar nakṣalras (or asterisms). 

The lunar zodiac is also found amongst the Chinese who designate them by the term Hsiu ; and amongst the Arabs, who call them Manzil, both terms denoting mean signs. Both the Chinese and the Arabs had 28 mansions. The Indian term 'nakṣatra' is of uncertain etymological origin. Some hold that the term nakṣatra carried the sense that 'it does not move' and meant a star. 

Names of certain nakṣatras' are found in the oldest scriptures of India, viz., the Rg-Vedas, but a full list is first found in the Yajurveda (vide § 5-3). In the older classics of India ( the Yajurveda, the Mahābhārata), the nakṣatras invariably start with Kritikā, the Pleiades ; the supposition has been made that the Kritikās were near the vernal point, when this enumeration was started. This is apparent from the couplet found in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa which runs thus : 

Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa, i, 1, 2, 1. Krttikāsv agnimādadhita. Mukham vā etan nakṣatrānām, Yat krttikā. Translation: One should consecrate the (sacred) fire in the Krttikās ;--the Kritikās are the mouth of the nakṣatras. 

Later during Siddhānta Jyotiṣa times the enumeration started with Aśvinī β Arietis) and this is still reckoned to be the first of the nakṣatras, although the vernal point has now receded to the Uttarabhādrapada group which should accordingly be taken as the first nakṣatra. But the change has not been done because the Indian astrologers have failed to correct the calendar for the precession of equinoxes. 

The Chinese start their Hsius with Citrā or α Virginis. This refers probably to the time when α Virginis was near the autumnal equinoctial point (285 A.D.). The Arabs start their Manzils with β Arietis (Ash-Sharaţāni). 

There has been a good deal of controversy regarding the place of origin of the lunar zodiac. Many savants were inclined to ascribe the origin of the 27 nakṣatra system to ancient Babylon, like all other early astronomical discoveries. But as far as the authors of this book are aware, there is no positive evidence in favour of this view. Thousands of clay tablets containing astronomical data going back to 2000 B.C., and extending up to the first century A.D. have been obtained, but none of them are known to have any reference to 27 or 28 lunar mansions. 

On the other hand (as mentioned before) some of the nakṣatra names are found in the oldest strata of the Rg-Vedas (vide § 5-2), which must be dated before 1200 B.C., and a full list with some difference in names is found in the Yajur-Veda, which must be dated before 600 B.C. Nobody has yet been able, to refute yet Max Muller's arguments in favour of the **indigenous origin of the Indian nakṣatra system** given in his preface to the Rg-Veda Samhitā, page xxxv. 

It should be admitted that the lunar zodiac was pre scientific, i.e., it originated before astronomers became conscious of the celestial equator and the ecliptic, and began to give positions of steller bodies with these as reference planes. The nakṣatras give very roughly the night-to-night position of the moon, by indicating its proximity to stars and star-groups. Many of the Indian stațs identified as nakṣatras are not at all near the ecliptic or the moon's path which, on account of its obliquity, is contained in a **belt within +5° of the ecliptic**. Such are for example : 

- (15) **Svāti**, which is identified with Arcturus Ta Bootis), which has a latitude of 31° N. 
- (22) **śravaṇa**, identified with α, β, y Aquilae, having the latitude of 29° N. 
- (23) **Śraviṣthā**, identified with α, β, Y, δ Delphini, a having the latitude of 33° N. 
- (25) **pūrva Bhādrapada** identified with α Pegasi and some other adjacent stars, α Pegasi having latitude of 19° N. 

At one time, the brilliant star **Vega (α Lyrae)** was also, included making 28 nakṣatras. But this has a latitude of 62° N and was later discarded. 

No satisfactory argument has been given for the inclusion of such distant stars in the lunar zodiac: The **Arabs and the Chinese** do not include these distant stars in their lunar zodiac, but **fainter ones near the ecliptic**, Prof. P. C. Sengupta is of the opinion that Indians generally preferred bright stars, but when such were not available near the ecliptic, they chose brighter ones away from the ecliptic, which could be obtained on the **line joining the moon's cusps**. 

The **nakṣatras were used to name the 'days'** in the earliest strata of Indian literature. Thus when the moon is expected to be found in the Maghā nakṣatra (α Leonis), the day would be called the Maghā day. This is the oldest method of designating the day, for it is found in the Rg-Vedas. Other methods of designating the day by **tithis or lunar days**, or by the seven week-days, came later. The system has continued to the present times. In old times, astrology was based almost entirely on the nakṣatras, e.g., in Asoka's records, the Puṣya nakṣatra day was regarded as auspicious when brāhmaṇas and Sramaṇas were fed, in order to enhance the king's puṇya (religious merits). In the Mahābhārata also we find that the days are designated by nakṣatras which apparently mean the star or star cluster near which the moon is expected to be seen during the night. 

As is apparent from Table No. 5, the nakṣatras are at **rather unequal distances**, i.e., they rarely follow the ideal distance of 13.5°. This is rather inconvenient for precision time-reckoning. We find in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa times an attempt at a precise definition of the **two limits of a nakṣatra**, which was defined as 800' ( 13° 20') of the ecliptic. The nakṣatra was named according to the most prominent star (**Yogatārā**) contained within these limits. These are given in. column (2) of Table 5.

We do not, however, have any idea as to how the beginnings and endings of the nakṣatra divisions were fixed in India. The prominent ecliptic stars which were used as Yogatārās (junction-stars) in pre-Siddhāntic period, are not distributed at regular intervals along the ecliptic ; and so it was found very difficult to include the stars in their respective equal divisions. This will be clear from table (No. 5) where the junction stars of the nakṣatras according to the Sūrya "Siddhānta are given in col. (2). The celestial longitudes of the stars for 1956 A.D. are given in col. (4) and the beginnings of each division for the same year are given in col. (5), taking the **star α Virginis to occupy the middle position of the nakṣatra Citrā**, which marked the **position of the autumnal equinox** at the time The divisions of nakṣatras shown in the table, as when the table was compiled. The figures in the last already stated, has been based on the assumption that column represent the position of the star in the nakṣatra the star Spica occupies the 180th degree of the lunar division of that name. It seems that a few of the zodiac. This arrangement agrees with the statement Yogatārās, viz, **No. 6 ārdrā, No. 15 Svātī, No. 18 Jyeṣthā, No. 20 Purvāṣādha, No. 21 Uttarāṣadhā, No. 22 Śravaṇa, and No. 23 Dhaniṣthā fall outside the nakṣatra division of which they are supposed to form the Yogatārā**. Matters do not improve much, if we shift the beginning of each division so as to place & Piscium (Revati) at the end of the Revati division or in other words at the beginning of the Aśvinī division. This will mean that the figures in col. (6) will then have to be increased by 3° 59', which will push up the Yogatārās of 1 Aśrini, 2 bharaṇī, 3* Krtrikā, 8 Pista 13 Hasta, 25 P. Bhādrapalā, and 26 U. Bhādrapada, so as to go outside the nakṣatra division of which they form the Yogatārā. In fact **no arrangement at any time appears to have been satisfactory enough for all the Yogatārās to fall within their respective nakṣatra divisions**.

The divisions of nakṣatras shown in the table, as already stated, has been based on the assumption that the star Spica occupies the 180th degree of the lunar zodiac. This arrangement agrees with the **statement of the Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa that the Dhanisṭhā star (α or β Delphini) marked the beginning of the Dhaniṣṭhā division**, and also of the **Varāha's Sūrya Siddhānta that Regulus (α Leonis) is situated at the 6th degree of the Maghā division**.
