I am glad that the Calendar Reform Committee has started its labours. The Government of India has entrusted to it the work of examining the different calendars followed in this country and to submit proposals to the Government for an accurate and uniform calendar based on a scientific study for the whole of India. I am told that we have at present thirty different calendars, differing from each other in various ways, including the methods of time reckoning. These calendars are the natural result of our past political and cultural history and partly represent past political divisions in the country. Now that we have attained independence, it is obviously desirable that there should be a certain uniformity in the calendar for our civic, social and other purposes and that this should be based on a scientific approach to this problem. 



It is true that for governmental and many other public purposes we follow the Gregorian calendar, which is used in the greater part of the world. The mere fact that it is largely used, makes * it important. It has many virtues, but even this has certain defects which make it unsatisfactory for universal use. 



It is always difficult to change a calendar to which people are used, because it affects social: practices. But the attempt has to be made even though it may not be as complete as desired. In any event, the present confusion in our own calendars, in India ought to be removed. 



I hope that our Scientists will give a lead in this matter.
