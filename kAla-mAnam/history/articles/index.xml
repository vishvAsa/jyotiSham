For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The names for the days of the week which have been adopted throughout western Europe are based on the names of the seven known &amp;lsquo;planets&amp;rsquo;, arranged in their supposed order of decreasing distance from the Earth &amp;ndash; Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon &amp;ndash; and are of astrological origin. &amp;hellip; The planet to which the first hour of the day was consecrated was regarded as the regent of that day&amp;hellip;. In the Teutonic languages, the names of their divinities Tiu, Woden, Thor, and Freya are used instead of their Roman counterparts, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus.&amp;rdquo; {{A History of Technology, volume 3, p. 565f}}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hindus celebrate the sathabhishekam in their 81st year, but they are mathematically challenged. Since you basically witness 12 moon orbits a year, 80 clocks up only 960 moon orbits. As per the traditional calendar, there is an adhika-maasa (also called mala-maasa, or intercalary month) about every 2.5 years. So in 80 years, there would be about 32 adhika-maasas. The remaining 8 new moons are seen in the 81st year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can actually count 1,000 new moons. Let me state it differently: The synodic period of the moon is about 29.5 days. So, it takes about 80.82 years for 1,000 synodic lunar months to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
