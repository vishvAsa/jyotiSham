## True claims
This video demonstrates that the logic behind naming the weekdays - in the Hindu way - was well recorded in Hindu texts.

> सप्त +एते होरेशाः शनैश्चराद्याः यथाक्रमं शीघ्राः ।  
शीघ्रक्रमात्चतुर्थाः भवन्ति सूर्योदयात्दिनपाः ॥ १६ ॥  
> इत्य् आर्यभटीये। 

This logic (or something similar) has been long known to scholars. For example:

> "The names for the days of the week which have been adopted throughout western Europe are based on the names of the seven known 'planets', arranged in their supposed order of decreasing distance from the Earth -- Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon -- and are of astrological origin. There was a great development of astrology in Egypt at the beginning of the Christian era; according to the current astrological beliefs, each hour in succession was consecrated to a different planet, the sequence following the order of their distance. The planet to which the first hour of the day was consecrated was regarded as the regent of that day.... In the Teutonic languages, the names of their divinities Tiu, Woden, Thor, and Freya are used instead of their Roman counterparts, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus." {{A History of Technology, volume 3, p. 565f}}


## False claims
### 7 day week
7 day week does not itself originate in India. There is no record or reference to it in vedic and vedAnga jyotiSha texts. 

The video blatantly lies saying "There is no evidence for all these- zero." Scholarly consensus (backed by strong evidence/ written records) is as follows:

> The seven-day week originates from the calendar of the Babylonians, which in turn is based on a Sumerian calendar dated to 21st-century B.C. Seven days corresponds to the time it takes for a moon to transition between each phase: full, waning half, new and waxing half. ... The Romans also inherited this system from Babylonian tradition, though they didn’t begin using it until the instatement of the Julian Calendar in the first-century B.C.

Hindu texts which mention the 7 day week system are - by their own astronomical references and declarations - from the AD-s.

### Day names
Day names associated with planets were recorded far earlier outside India, than inside.

Babylonians famously adored planets. Babylonian tablets, for example, record planetary movements meticulously.

- Sun - shamash
- Moon - sin
- Mars - Nergal
- Mercury - Nabu
- Jupiter - Marduk
- Venus - Ishtar

> the seven days of the Greek astrological “week” were: ἡμέρᾱ Ἡλίου (day of Helios), ἡμέρᾱ Σελήνης (day of Selene), ἡμέρᾱ Ἄρεως (day of Ares), ἡμέρᾱ Ἑρμοῦ (day of Hermes), ἡμέρᾱ Διός (day of Zeus), ἡμέρᾱ Ἀφροδῑ́της (day of Aphrodite), and, lastly, ἡμέρᾱ Κρόνου (day of Kronos). These days were only known by astrologers and were not used by everyday people.

(The Greeks acknowledged and used records from other civilizations.)

> dies Solis (day of Sol), dies Lunae (day of Luna), dies Martis (day of Mars), dies Mercurii (day of Mercurius), dies Iovis (day of Iove), dies Veneris (day of Venus), and dies Saturni (day of Saturnus).

## Conclusion
Besides some true quotations, video makes false claims and deliberately hides contrary evidence.

The attitude it imbibes is that Hindus did not learn from others when it was clearly not the case. This "vishva-guru-syndrome" leads to an arrogant mindset, which is opposed to humble and honest pursuit of truth - no matter where it comes from.
