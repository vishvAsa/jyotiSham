9. Arrived at the last stage of deterioration, we find Dharma, the Dog, in a fairy tale from Albania: The youngest daughter of a king — her two sisters resemble Regan and Goneril — offers to go to war in her father's place, asking for three suits only, and for the paternal blessing. "Then the king procured three male suits, and gave her his blessing, and this blessing changed into a little dog and went with the princess." J. G. von Hahn: Griechische und Albanische Märchen \[1918\], vol. *2*, p. 146.\).

17. The time structure is a very complicated one, and we cannot manage with a subdivision of two "periods" at all, the less so, as the reigns of the Shahs overlap with the rather miraculous lifetimes of the "heroes" or Paladins \(Rustam, Zal, etc.\). The same goes for the "primordial" emperors of China and their "vassals." But God protect us from meddling with lists of alleged "kings" from whichever area, but particularly from the Iranian tables\!
