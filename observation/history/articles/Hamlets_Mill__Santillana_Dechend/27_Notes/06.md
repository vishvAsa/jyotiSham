**Chapter VI**

1. *Skaldskap*. *42*, according to Brodeur \(1929\), pp. 163-69, and Neckel and Niedner \(Thule 20 \[1942\]\), pp. 195f. The other translators of Snorri's *Edda* cannot agree on the manner of dividing the work into chapters, if they do not desist from doing so at all, as R. B. Anderson \(1880\), pp. 206-13, parts of whose translation we quote here. \(Simrock \[n.d.\], pp. 89-93, makes it chapter 63.\)

2. P. Herrmann, *Die Heldensagen des Saxo Grammaticus* \(1922\), pp. 376ff.

3. These five verses are taken from Gollancz \(p. xiii\), the three previous and the two last lines from Brodeur \(pp. 162f.\); otherwise, we followed the Anderson translation.

4. It was J. G. von Hahn \(*Sagwissenschaftliche Studien* \[1876\], pp. 401f.\) who first pointed to the similarity of the episodes in Snorri's *Edda* and in the *Odyssey*.

5. I. Gollancz, *Hamlet in Iceland* \(1898\), p. xiv.

6. V. Rydberg, *Teutonic Mythology* \(1907\), p. 575.

7. Gollancz, pp. xviii.
