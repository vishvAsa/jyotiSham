8. See for the feat of this unpronounceable archer \(Rkhsha\) the report given by Al-Biruni, who spells him simply *Arish*. \(*The Chronology of Ancient Nations*, trans. E. Sachau \[1879\], p. 205\). The background of the tale: Afrasiyab had promised to restore to Minôcihr a part of Erânshar \(which had been conquered by him\) as long and as broad as an arrow shot. Arish shot the arrow on the 13th day of the month Tîr-Mâh, after having announced: "I know that when I shoot with this bow and arrow I shall fall to pieces and my life will be gone." Accordingly, when he shot, he "fell asunder into pieces. By order of God the wind bore the arrow away from the mountain of Rûyân and brought it to the utmost frontier of Khurâsân between Farghâna and Tabaristân; there it hit the trunk of a nut-tree that was so large that there had never been a tree like it in the world. The distance between the place where the arrow was shot and that where it fell was 1,000 Farsakh." \(See also S. H. Taqizadeh, *Old Iranian Calendars* \[1938\], p. 44,\) Tir or Ira is the name for Mercury \(see T. Hyde, *Veterum Persarum et Parthorum Religionis historia* \[1760\], p. 24: "Tir, i.e., Sagitta . . . quo etiam nomine appellatur Mercurius Planeta propter velociorem motum"\), but it is also, along with Tishtriya, the name for Sirius \(see A. Scherer, *Gestirnnamen bei den indogermanischen Völkern* \[1953\], pp. 113f.\), and the 13th day of every month is dedicated to Sirius-Tishriya \(see Lommel, p. 5\). We must leave it at that: Sirius-the-arrow has made more mythical "noise" than any other star, and also its connection with the ominous number 13 appears to be no Iranian monopoly.
