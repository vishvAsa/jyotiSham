***Appendix 18***  


Compare *Popol Vuh: The Sacred Book of the Ancient Quiché Maya* \(Eng. trans. by D. Goetz and S. Morley, \[1951\], pp. 90-102\). As concerns the escape of Zipacna, compare the distribution map, given by Frobenius \(*Paideuma 1* \[1938\], p. 8, map 3 — "Der Lausbub im Haus pfeiler"\).

For the whole motif of pillars and houses pulled down, compare Eduard Stucken, *Astralmythen* \(1896-1907\): pp. 73f. for the death of Nebrôd, according to Cedrenus — of Cain, according to Leo Grammaticus Chron. p. 8 \(Kain, hōs legei Mōysēs, tēs oikias pesousēs ep'auton eteleutēsen\); pp. 329f. for the case of Susanowo; p. 348 for Turkish Depe Ghöz; pp. 402f. for Zipacna; there, he also wants to incorporate Job 1.18. Stucken's complete blindness to the mere existence of planets has prevented him from better understanding; thus, he claims for the case of Job 1.18: "Auch hier ist die Orion-Gottheit \(Satan-Ahriman\), welche den Hauseinsturz verursacht, urn die Plejaden-Gottheit \(Hiob\) zu züchtigen." This blindness is the more astonishing as Stucken has read Eisenmenger's huge opus, "Entdecktes Judenthum" \(1711\), where he should have detected the identity \(as claimed by rabbinical literature\) of the planet Mars  with the serpent in Paradise, with Kain, Esau, Abimelech, Goliath, Sammael, the Scape-Goat, and many others.
