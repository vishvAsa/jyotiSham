***Appendix 3***  


Now, apart from the circumstance that the snowy burial ascribed to the followers of Kai Khusrau, Enoch, and Quetzalcouatl could hardly be claimed to be an "obvious" feature, the fate of Quetzalcouatl's companions might further our understanding; more correctly, the topos where this event is supposed to have happened might do so. The "five mountains" of Mexican myth, their "gods" respectively, the *Tepictoton*, \[1\]  appear to represent the five Uayeb \(= Maya; with the Aztecs: Nemontemi\), the Epagomena, those days gained by Mercury from the Moon during a game of checkers, in order to help Rhea/Nut to days "outside of the year," when she could bring forth the five planets. As a matter of fact, in his chapter on the clothes and emblems of the gods, Sahag√∫n puts the "Mountain-Gods" at the end of the list. \[2\]

Worth mentioning might be two more traits which Quetzalcouatl shares with his old-world brethren: Quetzalcouatl and Uemac, like Kai Ka'us and Kai Khusrau, are said to have ruled together, and Quetzalcouatl is accused of incestuous relations with his sister, as were Hamlet, Kullervo, Yama and, we might add, King Arthur. \[3\]
