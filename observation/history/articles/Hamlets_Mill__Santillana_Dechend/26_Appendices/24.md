***Appendix 24***  


Eduard Stucken \(*Astralmythen*, pp. 190ff.\) and, later, F. W. Albright \(JAOS *40*, pp. 329f.\) drew attention to the very same method employed when Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka \(son of Kashyapa\) and a hind, was lured by a courtesan, ordered by King Lomapada, into the latter's town, because only with Rishyasringa present would the country have rain. \(Compare H. Luders, "Die Sage von Rsyasrnga," in *Philologica **Indica* \[1940\], pp. 1-42; also Luders, "Zur Sage von Rsyasrnga," *Philologica Indica*, pp. 43-73.\)

The major difference between GE and the story told in the *Mahabharata* *3*.110-13 \(Roy trans., vol. 2, pp. 242-48\) is that Father Vibhandaka is the one "whose body was covered with hair down to the tip of the nails . . . and whose life was pure and was passed in religious meditation"; seduced is the son, not a hairy one, apparently, but "there was a horn on the head of that magnanimous saint". "Saints" they were both â€” those Indians of "high and far-off times" were in the habit of building up *tapas*, "ascetic heat," an instrument of the utmost cosmic "efficiency," if we may style it thus.
