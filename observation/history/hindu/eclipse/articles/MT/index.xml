      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/01/18/divakirtya-s-eclipses-and-severed-heads/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We saw how the aitareya brAhmaNa describes the &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/01/15/the-crashing-doors/&#34;&gt;divAkIrtya-s&lt;/a&gt; as the frame of solstice points that “holds up” the sun. The pa~nchavimsha brAhman 4.6 describes the divAkIrtya-s, just as the taittirIya and kaTha texts, in the context of the solstice rite but also adds a second context: namely that of the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It repeats a famous tale of the dAnava svarbhAnu (PB4.6.13-15):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;” The demonic svarbhAnu seized the sun with darkness. The gods drove the darkness with the dIvAkIrtya. The divAkIrtya-s are the rays of the sun, by means of the rays they indeed take hold of the sun.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that eclipses lunar &amp;amp; solar have been central to a lot of key science from the days of the ancients to until recently. The first estimates of the ratio of the moon-earth diameters by the H &amp;amp; yavana-s came from this. Both reached conclusion of the spherical earth &amp;amp; heavenly bodies from this. Planetary theory arose from eclipse observations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closer to our times space-time distortion by gravity (general relativity) was tested by this. Highly ionized Fe which was thought to be a new element was also discovered from eclipse observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
