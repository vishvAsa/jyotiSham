      <description>&lt;p&gt;जरद्गवः कम्बल-पादुकाभ्यां&#xA;द्वारि स्थितो गायति मत्तकानि।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तं ब्राह्मणी पृच्छति पुत्रकामा&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;राजन् रुमायां+++(=लवणाकरे)+++ लशुनस्य कोऽर्थः+++(→मूल्यम्)+++&amp;quot;॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Elisa Freschi&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;``The old ox sings crazy songs staying on the door with woolen sandals. A Brāhmana woman who desires a child asks him: `O king! What is the value of garlic in a salt-mine?&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is quoted by Śabara and then by many others as an example of an inconsistent Vedic sentence. The problem is: We can&amp;rsquo;t locate a Vedic source for it now! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine that someone (e.g., a Mīmāṃsā opponent) would have just made it up, because no one replies accordingly. They rather accept that it is Vedic and try to explain away the seeming lack of meaning…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;{&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/06/the-snake-of-vishnu/&#34;&gt;MT04&lt;/a&gt;} - &amp;ldquo;ViShNu is a predominantly precessional deity. All his five early incarnations contain the precessional motifs that were uncovered by Santillana and von Dechend in The Hamlet’s Mill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;{&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/22/dandins-purvapithika-of-dasha-kumara-charitra/&#34;&gt;MT06&lt;/a&gt;} - &amp;ldquo;It is in this context that the great R^ikSha jAmbavant is described as circumambulating trivikrama as he took his great strides. This represents the new axis being established and the constellation of the Great Bear (represented as the bear jAmbavant) making a circle of the north celestial pole. Indeed viShNu himself is identified with the constellation of the shishumAra or Draco associated with the old north pole from earlier period of Aryan memory.  As the knowledge of precession is very subtle (even alluded in the opening of the maitrayaNi brAhmaNa fragment (&amp;ldquo;अथ किमेतैर्वान्यानां शोषणं महार्णवानां शिखरिणां प्रपतनं ध्रुवस्य प्रचलनं स्थानं वा तरूणां निमज्जनं पृथिव्याः स्थानादपसरणं सुराणं&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/maitri.html?lang=sa&#34;&gt;MU&lt;/a&gt;) by shAkAyanya who was well aware of these matters) the third step of viShNu is secret and was only know to the great kavi-s.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;In Indian architecture its depicted more directly on many occasions, but more subtly in the great iron pillar of the guptas. Before the iron pillar was uprooted by the Mohammedans and placed in the vicinity of their giant phallic signpost at Delhi, it graced the now derilict Hindu astronomical observatory at the viShNupAda-giri in the udayagiri complex. The iron pillar (as shown by Balasubramanian) was graced by a nakShatra-chakra on the top and was known as the viShNu dhvaja– depicting the great axis in front of the observatory located atop the hill. Thus, in the immortal pillar did chandragupta II vikramAditya, one of the greatest rulers of bhArata commemorate the step of viShNu and and world axis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
