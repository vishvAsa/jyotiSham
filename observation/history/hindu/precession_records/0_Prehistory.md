> The veda also furnishes direct accounts of the deadly jaw-like nature of the halves of the years ...Thus, the crashing doors are the halves of the year held by the frame of solstices and equinoxes. ...  the deadly crashing doors are an ancient mythic motif representing the year and might be used in the precession myths. ... A corollary would be that these mythic motifs had come into being at least by 12000 year BP when the Native Americans are believed to have separated from the Eurasians. If so the long records of precession ‘literally” yuga after yuga” might not be surprising.
