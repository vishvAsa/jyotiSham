## Error bar
- In case of equal division of zodiac into nakShatra-s - "precession of solstices takes place by a full _Nakshatra_ in about 972 years." Such equal division might not have existed in early vedic times - so in that case, visual neighborhood estimates are more apt.

## नक्षत्रमुखम्
- तैत्तिरीय-ब्राह्मणारण्यकयोर् नक्षत्रमुखभेदेन तज्ज्ञानं व्यक्तम्।

> "assertion of the American indologist Whitney maintained to this date among Abrahamistic white indologists and their imitators: "The Hindus borrowed their nakShatra system from Mesopotamia and would probably have retained it in that form \[i.e. with kR^ittikA at the vernal equinox of 2300 BCE\] until the present day but for the revolution wrought in their science by Greek teaching." Clearly even within the vaidika period (including vedA~Nga jyotiSha) the Hindus had made multiple changes for precession not just at the time of varAhamihira after interactions with yavana-s." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/)\]
