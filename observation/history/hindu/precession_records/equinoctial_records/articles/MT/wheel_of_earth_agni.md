title = "Wheel of earth - agni"

> mUrdhAnaM divo aratim pR^ithivyA  
vaishvAnaram R^ita A jAtam agnim |  
kaviM samrAjam atithiM janAnAm  
Asann A pAtraM janayanta devAH ||

One of the awe-inspiring motifs in shruti is that of agni at the head of heaven, as the wheel of earth & as the cup from which the gods feed

> The head of Heaven, the spoked wheel of Earth,  
agni vaishvAnara born in the natural law,  
the seer, the emperor, the guest of the folks,  
As a cup for the mouth, the gods generated.

Both metaphors, "head of heaven"& "the mouth of the gods" likely represented year beginning colures

The phrase of the "wheel of earth/people" occurs multiple times across different authors.:

- bharadvAja: aratim pR^ithivyA;  
- gR^itsamada: divaspR^ithivyor aratiM ny erire |; 
- vAmadeva: devAso devam aratiM nyerira iti kratvA nyerire |; 
- vasiShTha:  havyavAham aratim mAnuShANAm |; 
- vatsapri: vishAm akR^iNvann aratim pAvakaM

It is a concept that today appears difficult to grasp but is clearly related to the ancient motif of the wheel that was common among the Indo-Europeans. In the context of the earth we wonder if it was an early knowledge of the earth turning around like a wheel. Such a metaphor is indeed used sometimes in later H astronomical texts and ridiculed by the geostationary thinkers like appayya dIkShita.
