> "द्वादशात्मकं वत्सरम्। एतस्याग्नेयम् अर्धम्, अर्धं वारुणं।  
> मघाद्यं श्रविष्ठार्धम् आग्नेयं क्रमेण,  
> +उत्क्रमेण सार्पाद्यं श्रविष्ठार्धान्तं सौम्यम्"   

श्रविष्ठार्ध - ardha here seems to indicate roughly equal naxatra divisions.

Since the MU also talks about pole star moving too much.. placing it in 1900 or 1800 would be easier compared to say 1400.

solisticial points here are indicated as maghAdyam|sarpAdyam+++(=their boundary)+++ and shraviShTArdham. this would approximately correspond to ~1800 BCE marking a change from the earlier reference to solisticial point lying inside magha in AV nakShatrasUkta"\[[SD](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/maitri.html?lang=sa), [MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/984634039909978112)

Corresponds to equinox close to bharaNI.
