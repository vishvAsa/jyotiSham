      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2023/02/20/some-ruminations-on-asteroids-and-meteoritic-falls/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some ruminations on asteroids and meteoritic falls&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, we received the news of a Russian spacecraft meant to bring some astronauts back to earth being hit by a meteorite. In early February we saw an obscure news item of the sighting of a meteoric fireball over Krasnoyarsk. This brought to mind the several spectacular meteoritic falls in Russia. There was the dramatic Tunguska event that occurred on June 30, 1908, in a remote part of Siberia. While no one was killed by the fall, it is said that people standing over 60 km from the site of the hit were felled by the shock waves it unleashed. Modern estimates say the Tunguska explosion might have been equivalent to 10 million tons (10 mT) of trinitrotoluene — effectively close to one of the biggest nuclear bombs that was in active American service during the Cold War according to declassified files from 2014 (B53). Thus, such an asteroid falling on a city would obliterate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the earliest extant layers of our tradition this number is 28 implying division into sectors of&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12%5Ctfrac%7B6%7D%7B7%7D%5Eo&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12%5Ctfrac%7B6%7D%7B7%7D%5Eo&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&#34; alt=&#34;12\tfrac{6}{7}^o&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;or insertion of a nakṣatra with adjacent compressed sectors. The earliest complete nakṣatra lists are found in the Taittirīya-śruti and the Atharvaveda where they are recited as part of the nakṣatreṣṭi ritual which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments. Indeed, ever since it has been common practice in Hindu astronomy to use the names of the deities corresponding to a given compartment alternatively for the nakṣatra itself. The old nakṣatra-lists in the TS, Laugākṣi’s sūtra-s and the Atharvaveda begin with Kṛttikā i.e., the Pleiades, suggesting that the system as described in these texts was put in place sometime in the interval of 4500-4000 years before present. However, we hold that the nakṣatra system did not begin with these texts. These texts are mostly predated by the ṛgveda, where we find stray references to specific nakṣatra-s and also the term itself in its generic sense. Thus, we believe a form of the system was already in place even in the days of the ṛgveda. Further, there are some homologies between nakṣatra-s and Iranian asterisms suggesting that some form of the system might have existed even in the Indo-Iranian past on the Eurasian steppes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/the-oldest-surviving-planetary-ritual-of-the-hindus/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain white Indologists and their Japanese imitators have often held the dishonest view that Hindus were unaware of planets until the yavana-s informed them of their existence in the sky. This view was demolished by the great patriot of the Hindu nation Lokamanya Tilak about a century ago. In fact he showed that the proto-Indo-Europeans&#xA;(leaving out the Hittites) certainly knew of the brightest planet in the&#xA;sky. Of course this is encoded in the form the venas recitation with the shukra and manthin graha-s. But a question still remains: Does any relatively early vedic rite specifically directed at the planets exist and survive. One example of this graheShTi of the kaTha yajurvedin-s:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>nakShatra homa as per the kAThaka yajurvedins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/nakshatra-homa-as-per-the-kathaka-yajurvedins/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nakShatra homa as performed by the taittirIyaka-s utilizes the famed nakShatra-sUktaM and the elaborate mantra prescriptions from from the taittirIya brAhmaNa (3.1). The kaTha-s have a very different tradition of nakShatra homa. With the denudation and extinction of the kaTha tradition this appears to have been lost, but we can reconstruct it in large part due to the commentary of the kaTha ritualist devapAla. devapAla was in the line of great kaTha yajurvedins from like: 1) gauradhara the R^ig/yajur dvivedI from Kashmir who composed a now lost, but supposedly notable, commentary on the kAThaka saMhitA known as veda-vilAsa. 2) lakShmIdeva, a noted performer of shrauta rituals and 3) Adityadarsha. devapAla appears to have been one of those last great brahmin scholars who was intimately acquainted with the rituals of the kaTha tradition and he describes the denudation of brahminical tradition around him. While by all accounts he was smArta, in terms of tantric and laukIka disposition he was inclined towards the Kashimirian lineage of pA~ncharAtra mantra-shAstra and even composed a great stava on viShNu. In terms of philosophical affiliations he belonged to the yoga school and composed a scholarly commentary on the sUtra-s of pata~Njali. At the same time his work clearly shows that he was a master of the mImAMsa school. He was born in Jalandhar, Panjab, to a vedic scholar haripAla son of bhaTTa upendra. He wrote his great work on the laugAkShi kalpa sUtra-s in jayapura near Shrinagar, Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/01/18/divakirtya-s-eclipses-and-severed-heads/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We saw how the aitareya brAhmaNa describes the &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/01/15/the-crashing-doors/&#34;&gt;divAkIrtya-s&lt;/a&gt; as the frame of solstice points that “holds up” the sun. The pa~nchavimsha brAhman 4.6 describes the divAkIrtya-s, just as the taittirIya and kaTha texts, in the context of the solstice rite but also adds a second context: namely that of the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It repeats a famous tale of the dAnava svarbhAnu (PB4.6.13-15):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;” The demonic svarbhAnu seized the sun with darkness. The gods drove the darkness with the dIvAkIrtya. The divAkIrtya-s are the rays of the sun, by means of the rays they indeed take hold of the sun.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But they must be credited for noting the significance of mythic motifs that were previously overlooked by most. One point they just allude to, but fail to expand upon is the issue of crashing doors. What exactly are these crashing doors in the language of myth? Based on some myths the above authors conclude that it must have some connection to the frame of time but fail to clarify this explicitly, especially in connection to their central theme — the mythic accounts of the precession of the axis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/02/vedanga-jyotisha-and-other-ramblings-on-early-hindu-calenders/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vedA~NGa jyotiSha has been a strikingly difficult text to fathom despite its small size. It is the late vedic text that appears to be a quick and handy guide for calenderical calculations. It has attracted much attention of Western scholars, despite not understanding much of it. Yet they use it as a starting point to suggest how the Hindus were definitely astronomical idiots. This trend set by the early Western scholars regarding Hindu astronomy is repeated to this date as a part of their program to present the picture of “India as the cul de sac” (vide Michael Witzel, a German Indologist). The view of the early white Indologists on Hindu astronomy is epitomized by the American Indologist Whitney (the translator of the atharva veda)’s comments on the VJ: “And when we come to add that the Jyotisha (VJ) has no definable place in Sanskrit literature, or relation to the Vedic ceremonial.. we shall see that this famous datum, which has seemed to promise so much, has caused so much labour and discussion, and is even yet clung to by some scholars as the sheet-anchor of ancient Hindu chronology, is nothing but a delusive phantom.”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;While this and succeeding views of the white Indologists and their Japanese imitators have acquired wide currency, Hindu scholars have labored on interpretting the text correctly to a great measure. However, to give where credit is due an early white scholar Thibaut was fairly effective in interpretting a number of verses. The first Hindu scholar to make a major in road was S.B. Dikshit, who labored on this text not far from the place where I spent a good part of my life. Dikshit’s work unfortunately did not acquire wide readership because it was written in the Maharatti language. He was followed by the Northerner Chote Lala and Sudhakara Dvivedi the paNDita from Kashi who successfully interpretted a little more of the text, though they were locked in conflict between themselves. The great B.G. Tilak then further clarified some points. The final assault on the text along with a modern English translation was provided by the smArta savant shrI kuppanna shAstrI, who more or less interpretted most of the text. If we can today understand some of the elegant devices of the VJ, it is only because of kuppanna shAstrI’s enormous scholarship, setting the true standards for the kind of scholarship needed to tackle complex texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We drew that little cluster, the mothers of our god, and the three stars in a line, which form the arrow of The god. All this got imprinted in our minds. Over the ages the language of myth has preserved the passage of time through this region of the sky and beyond. Tilak first and de Santillana and von Dechend thereafter (the latter two are possibly plagiarists of Tilak, who failed to cite him appropriately) realized some of the underlying celestial secrets. We continue this journey of exploration through this part of the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They indeed had seen the truth. One who know this will understand the hymns of sauchIka agni.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is technically defined in the sUrya-siddhAnta (8.13) thus:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;vR^iShe saptadashe bhAge yasya yAmyo .aMshakadvayAt |&lt;br&gt;&#xA;vikShepo .abhyadhiko bhindyAd rohiNyAH shakaTaM tu saH ||&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the constellation of vR^iSha (Taurus), at 17th degree, a planet of which the latitude is a little more than 2 degrees, south, will split the cart of rohiNI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his bR^ihat saMhitA, varAhamihira mentions that the planets that are considered for this conjunction are arka-nandana (the son of the sun, the inauspicious shanaishchara- Saturn), rudhira (the red Mars) or shikhI (a tufted one or a comet). varahamihira himself cites the Atharvavedic astronomer vR^iddha garga (author of the atharvanic nakShatra hymns, although I was unable to locate a direct reference to the event in the surviving sUkta-s and nivid-s of garga from the atharvan saMhitA as well as nakShatra kalpa) as the authority who described this type of conjunction. The shakaTabheda is believed by the Hindus to be a harbinger of immense destruction or the flooding of the world by the ocean. The medieval Maharatta astronomer gaNesha daivaj~na correctly noted that the shakaTabheda by the Moon was relatively common but that by Saturn or Mars was not possible in the current yuga and might possibly occur/ed in some very distant yuga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Nebula occurs just below a group of stars termed the Phi1 and Phi2 Ceti forming a near equilateral triangle with them. The object is a very faint shroud that appears to envelop a group of stars around int in nebulosity. Discovered by Wilhelm Herschel.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ne.jp/asahi/stellar/scenes/object_e/ic342.htm&#34;&gt;http://www.ne.jp/asahi/stellar/scenes/object_e/ic342.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IC342 in Cameleopardus is a low brightness galaxy of the Mafei group. Though it is very close to the Milky Way (about 8.2*10^6 light years), it is not at all easy to sight. A group of faint stars from the Milky way that surround it help one to distinguish the nebulosity.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ne.jp/asahi/stellar/scenes/object_e/ngc246.htm&#34;&gt;http://www.ne.jp/asahi/stellar/scenes/object_e/ngc246.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They like to tell us that the Indo-Europeans were a primitive lot with not much astronomy to talk about. Everything the Indo-Europeans got is from the Middle Eastern civilizations of the Biblical milieu- Assyria, Egypt, Sumeria, Babylonia, Mesopotamia is the root of all astronomical and mathematical knowledge- they like the blather on. Hindu borrowed from the Middle East to produce the primitive vedAnga jyotiSha they tell us. However, a study of the Hindu and the Greek astronomy while revealing several regional developments still have a basic underlying core that was most probably derived from the Indo-European past. The example include the name of the constellation Orion and the name of the Vedic sacrifice AghrayaNa, whose performance was marked originally by the equinoctical position of Orion. The Hindus developed the 27/28 nakShatra system. The origins of this are murky but clearly the “28th” nakShatra abhijit was used to mark the vishuvAn day at a certain point and dropped later after the axial precession had pushed it away from that point. This and other points suggest that the Hindus have been using the nakShatra sytem from at least before 2700 BC, suggesting a long history of their independent developments after branching from the Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After an initial survey of bright globulars we pursued the planetary nebulae with a vengence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) NGC 6210 in Hercules: Small faint disk. About 6500 light years away. Discovered by Wilhelm Struve, successor of Herschel in 1827. Hubble has revealed it to contain two shells of gas.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981028.html&#34;&gt;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981028.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) NGC 6543 in Draco: Medium bright disk. Discovered by Wilhelm Herschel in 1786 is very close to the ecliptic north pole. Also known as the Cat’s eye nebula.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1995/01/&#34;&gt;http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1995/01/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/05/the-finnish-epic/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kalevala is the only well-preserved piece of mythology Uralic people. A few fragments of the tales of other shamanic peoples of this group exist, but none in a complete epic as the Kalevala, which was rescued from extinction by the Finnish nationalist Loenrot. A number of ancient mythic motifs (often astronomical) might be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Ilmatar the progenitor of the universe breaks an egg which gives rise to heaven and earth. The yolk become the sun and the white the moon. (Compare with the hiraNyagarbha motif)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2) A giant oak grows that blocks out the path of the sun and there is no light. A tiny man emerges from the sea. He grows into giant and confidentally fells the tree with three blows of his axe. The sun stars shining again and there is growth of plants (Note the similarity with the viShNu mythic motifs)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;3) The fantastic fir tree that emerges due to the spells of Vainaemoienen with the Big Bear (Ursa Major) and the moon on its branches. The smith hero Ilmarinen climbs the tree and is transported by a whirlwind to a different world (The tree as world axis motif again. This may be the new axis emerging after old one was cut down by the one who grew to be the giant).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He lived a difficult life, full of personal troubles and disease, yet he was remarkably productive and innovative. This was a clear sign of his pure genius.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1596 he announced his support for the Copernican model in the book Mysterium Cosmographicum and showed its explanative power. It also contained his false polyhedral model of the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1604 he and his student Jan Brunowski discovered a supernova in Ophiuchus, which went to attain the magnitude of -2.5. Kepler provided the first description of the light curve of a supernova in the pamphlet De Stella Nova, observing it constantly for over and year till it fell below Mag 6.6&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/05/30/indra-stuti/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The indra stuti is another hymn in the pauShya section of the adiparavan of the mahAbhArata (1.3.150-1.3.153 in the critical Poona edition of the mahAbhArata) which appears to be a composition of the “intermediate period”. However it bears certain distinctive features that differentiate if from the ashvina stuti and suggest that it is even closer to the transitional period than the former. It appears in the same frame story as the ashvina stuti of upamanyu: veda of the bhArgava clan was a student of Ayodo dhaumya. After he had gone through his own trial he was granted mastery over the veda and the dharmasutras by Ayodo dhaumya. He then founded his own school and had his own student also of the bhArgava clan, utta~Nka. Once the kShatriyas pauShya and janamejaya invited veda to serve as the brahmA priest in their sacrifice. veda left, instructing utta~Nka to take full care of his household. When he was away veda’s wife moved by amorous arousal asked utta~Nka to have sex with her, but he firmly refused. veda on his return was pleased with the conduct of utta~Nka and graduated him, and asked to proceed on his own. He insisted that he would need to pay veda his parting fee though veda asked him to take it easy. Pressed thus veda asked utta~Nka to ask his wife for whatever she wanted and provide that as the fee. She demanded the earrings of the queen of pauShya. So utta~Nka went on his quest. On the way he saw a gigantic bull and mighty man tending it. The man ordered utta~Nka to eat the dung of the bull and drink its urine. utta~Nka refused but the mighty man commanded utta~Nka to do stating that his own teacher had done the same &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After partaking of the unclean material, utta~Nka washed his mouth, purified himself and went to pauShya and asked him for his queen’s earrings. The kShatriya asked utta~Nka to go and ask her directly in her apartment. He went there but the queen was not in sight. He came back and asked pauShya why that was so. The king told him that he was impure due to improper purification after his meal and the queen did not give audience to unclean souls. So utta~Nka again rigorously purified himself and went to the queen and made the request for her earrings that were desired by veda’s wife. She gladly gave that to him but stated that he would have to safe guard them from takShaka the nAga who also desired them. The king then asked him to have shrAddha lunch before he left as he was a learned brahmin. It turned out that the lunch was cold and defiled by the hair of a woman. Getting furious utta~Nka cursed the king with blindness. The pauShya was taken aback by the curse and in retaliated by cursing the brahmin with sterility. utta~Nka objected by stating that it was king who had offended him first and showed him the hair and cold food. The king accepted that there had been a problem with the food, so the brahmin stated that pauShya’s blindness would eventually be cured. The king was unable to withdraw his curse but utta~Nka stated that he would eventually smother the curse with his own brahman power as he was not on the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It shone as fuzz ball in the southern sky, in the constellation of Eridanus (The southern river; the celestial yamunA of the Hindus which leads to the path of death). It was a little above the level of Sirius, the head of shabala praised at the morning shuna shairya offering of the pa~nchavimsha brAhmaNa. I estimate its magnitude as around 4.5 and was able to perceive a slight tail with the binoculars. It is supposed to rise higher beyond Orion. I uttered the incantation of the dogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In essence what they tell us by means of writing several prolix papers and using sophisticated jargon is the same as what Mr. Macaulay briskly delivered in his minute. “The vast accumulations of Indian literature is worth less than a shelf of books in a good European library.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Traditionally, in India too the constellation is refered to as the sArathi, which means the same thing. The mainstream Western scholarship has believed that this is a recent acquisition of the constellation name from the Greco-Roman world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Auriga is the charioteer, where is his car? India star-lore records an unsual name for the Hyades cluster in constellation of Taurus: rohINi shakaTa: The cart of roHiNi (alpha Tauri) [sUrya siddhAnta, 8.13]. Not surprisingly, the constellation is also called the shakaTa of prajApati or brahmA [ pa~ncha siddhAnta 238-241]. Traditionally, Hindu astronomy records the star Capella (alpha-Aurigae) as brahma-hR^idaya(the heart of brahmA).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The veda also furnishes direct accounts of the deadly jaw-like nature of the halves of the years &amp;hellip;Thus, the crashing doors are the halves of the year held by the frame of solstices and equinoxes. &amp;hellip;  the deadly crashing doors are an ancient mythic motif representing the year and might be used in the precession myths. &amp;hellip; A corollary would be that these mythic motifs had come into being at least by 12000 year BP when the Native Americans are believed to have separated from the Eurasians. If so the long records of precession ‘literally” yuga after yuga” might not be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only master of this kind of observation hitherto has been Marcel Griaule (d. 1956) but he left an impressive cohort of disciples. They have renewed the understanding of African studies, showing that such systems are still alive with the Dogon, whom Griaule &amp;ldquo;discovered,&amp;rdquo; in the true sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Germaine Dieterlen writes: &amp;ldquo;The smallest everyday object may reveal a conscious reflection of a complex cosmogony . . . Thus for instance African techniques, so poor in appearance, like those of agriculture, weaving and smithing, have a rich, hidden content of significance . . . The sacrifice of a humble chicken, when accompanied by the necessary and effective ritual gestures, recalls in the thinking of those who have experienced it an understanding that is at once original and coherent of the origins and functioning of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lunar-calendar&#34;&gt;Lunar calendar&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like other nations of antiquity the early Egyptians had a year of &lt;strong&gt;360 days divided into 12 months, each of 30 days&lt;/strong&gt;; but they found very early from the recurrence of the Nile flood, that the seasonal year consisted approximately of 365 days, and that a month or lunation (period from one new-moon to another) was nearly 29.4 days (real length 29.531 days). But they had already framed a calendar on the 30-day month, and 360-day year, which had received religious sanction. Hence arose the first necessity for calendar reform recorded in ancient history. To persuade the people to agree to this reform their priests invented the following myth :&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For official purposes, India has been using the Gregorian calendar since the imposition of the British rule in 1757. As the Gregorian calendar, on account of historic reasons, has attained the status of a World Calendar, it is still being used for official purposes after the attainment of Independence. There is a proposal sponsored by India before the UNO for the intro duction of a new World Calendar for civil and administrative purposes in place of the Gregorian calendar, which is inconvenient and unscientific (vide C §2.7).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(1) The śaka era should be used in the unified national calendar. The year 1954-55 A.D. corresponds to 1876 śaka or in other words the year 1954 A.D. corresponds to 1875-76 śaka.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(2) The year should start from the day following the vernal equinox day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(3) A normal year would consist of 365 days while a leap-year would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the śaka era, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it is a leap-year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap-year only when it is. divisible by 400, otherwise it would be a common year.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The years Śaka 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, 1894 etc., are leap-years consisting of 366 days each. But the gears 2022, 2122, 2222 and again 2422, 2522, 2622 śaka are not leap-years, while 1922, 2322, 2722 śaka are leap-years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(4) Caitra ( pronounced as Chaitra ) should be the first month of the year, and the lengths of the different months would be fixed as follows:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caitra 30 days (31 days in a leap-year ), Vaiśākha-31, Jyaiṣtha-31, Aṣadha-31 Śrāvana–31, Bhadra-31, āśvina-30, Kartika-30, Agrahāyana&amp;ndash;30, Pauṣa-30, Magha-30, and Phalguna-30 days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Corresponding dates :- The dates of the reformed Indian calendar would thus have a permanent correspondence with the dates of the present Gregorian calendar. The corresponding dates are as follows :&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Indian Calendar &amp;hellip; Gregorian Calendar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caitra 1 &amp;hellip; March 22 in a common year &amp;amp; March 21 in a leap-year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vaiśākha 1 April 21&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jyaiṣtha 1 &amp;hellip; May 22&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aṣadha &amp;hellip; June 22&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Srāvana 1 &amp;hellip; July 23&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhadra August 23&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Āśvina 1 September 23&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kārtika 1 October 23&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Agrahāyana 1 November 22&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pausa 1 December 22&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Māgha 1 January 21&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Phālguna 1 &amp;hellip; February 20&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with respect to the reformed calendar, as follows :&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seasons, Calendar months&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grīṣma (Summer)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vaiśākha &amp;amp; Jyaiṣtha Varṣā (Rains )&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Āsādha &amp;amp; Srāvana Śarat (Autumn)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhadra &amp;amp; Āśvina Hemanta (Late Autumn)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kartika &amp;amp; Agrahāyana Sisira ( Winter )&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pausa &amp;amp; Magha Vasanta ( Spring )&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Phalguna &amp;amp; Caitra (Summer)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In course of implementation of these recommendations, the states now having the solar calendar for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaiśākha 1 ( April 14 ), will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Cailra. The effect of this on the states are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-indicators&#34;&gt;Time indicators&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Flux of Time, of which we are all conscious, is apparently without beginning or end, but it is cut up periodically by several natural phenomena, viz. :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(1) by the ever-recurring alternation of daylight and night,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(2) by the recurrence of the moon&amp;rsquo;s phases,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(3) by the recurrence of seasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is these recurring phenomena which are used to measure time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These phenomena have the greatest importance for man, for they determine all human and animal life. Even prehistoric men could not help. noticing these time-periods, and their effect on life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am glad that the Calendar Reform Committee has started its labours. The Government of India has entrusted to it the work of examining the different calendars followed in this country and to submit proposals to the Government for an accurate and uniform calendar based on a scientific study for the whole of India. I am told that we have at present thirty different calendars, differing from each other in various ways, including the methods of time reckoning. These calendars are the natural result of our past political and cultural history and partly represent past political divisions in the country. Now that we have attained independence, it is obviously desirable that there should be a certain uniformity in the calendar for our civic, social and other purposes and that this should be based on a scientific approach to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Egyptians appear to have been the only cultural nation of antiquity who discarded the moon entirely as a time-marker. Other contemporaneous cultural nations, e.g. the Sumero-Akkadians of Babylon, and the Vedic Indians retained both the sun and the moon as time-markers, the &lt;strong&gt;sun for the year, the moon for the month&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Indian astronomers called the &lt;strong&gt;moon māsakrt&lt;/strong&gt;, (month-maker) and before the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa time, the moon was considered more important as a time marker than the sun (vide §5). It was the same with other nations too, for as Pannekoek remarks, we find the opinion written in the sacred books of many nations &amp;ldquo;For regulating time, the moon has been created&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The scheme of lunar months given in Table No. 4 in a nineteen-year period, which came into vogue in Babylon about 383 B.C. did not, however, completely satisfy the needs of the Babylonian calendar, because for religious purposes, the month was to start on the day the crescent moon was first visible in the western horizon after conjunction with the sun (the new moon), a custom which is still followed in the Islamic countries. But the first visibility may not occur on the predicted day for manifold reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The time-periods in Indian history necessary for our purpose are shown in the Chronological Table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The earliest civilization so far discovered in India is the &lt;strong&gt;Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro&lt;/strong&gt; civilization (sometimes also called the Indus-Valley civilization) named after the two ancient buried cities of Harappa in the Punjab and Mohenjo-Daro in Sind. They were first brought to light by the late R.D. Banerjee, Superinten dent of the Western Circle of Archaeology of India in 1924. It has now been ascertained that this civilization extended right upto Rupar on the Sutlej in the east and to the Narmada valley in the south. This civilization was certainly contemporaneous with the Mesopotamian civilizations of about 2500 B.C., nearly 500 years before the city of Babylon had risen to supremacy amongst the cities of Sumer and Akkad ; and with the first dynastic civilization of Egypt. How far back it projected into the time-scale is not yet known, but certainly many thousand years back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The father of Saxo&amp;rsquo;s Amlethus was &lt;em&gt;Horvandillus&lt;/em&gt;, written also Orendel, Erentel, Earendel, Oervandill, Aurvandil, whom the appendix to the &lt;em&gt;Heldenbuch&lt;/em&gt; pronounces the first of all heroes that were ever born. The few data known about him are summarized by Jacob Grimm: [1]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He suffers shipwreck on a voyage, takes shelter with a master fisherman Eisen, [2]  earns the seamless coat of his master, and afterwards wins frau Breide, the fairest of women: king Eigel of Trier was his father&amp;rsquo;s name. The whole tissue of the fable puts one in mind of the Odyssey: the shipwrecked man clings to a plank, digs himself a hole, holds a bough before him; even the seamless coat may be compared to Ino&amp;rsquo;s veil, and the fisher to the swineheard, dame Breide&amp;rsquo;s templars would be Penelope&amp;rsquo;s suitors, and angels are sent often, like Zeus&amp;rsquo;s messengers. Yet many things take a different turn, more in German fashion, and incidents are added, such as the laying of a naked sword between the newly married couple, which the Greek story knows nothing of. The hero&amp;rsquo;s name is found even in OHG. documents: Orendil . . . Orentil . . . a village Orendelsal, now Orendensall, in Hohenlohe . . . But the Edda has another myth, which was alluded to in speaking of the stone in Thor&amp;rsquo;s head. Groa is busy conning her magic spell, when Thorr, to requite her for the approaching cure, imparts the welcome news, that in coming from Jötunheim in the North he has carried her husband the bold Örvandill in a basket on his back, and he is sure to be home soon; he adds by way of token, that as Örvandil&amp;rsquo;s toe had stuck out of the basket and got frozen, he broke it off and flung it at the sky, and made a star of it, which is called &lt;em&gt;Örvandils-tâ&lt;/em&gt;. But Groa in her joy at the tidings forgot her spell, so the stone in the god&amp;rsquo;s head never got loose (Snorri&amp;rsquo;s Skaldskap. 17).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;( -1200 B.C.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vedic-literature&#34;&gt;The Vedic Literature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of the calendar in this age can be obtained only from the Vedic literature which consists however of different strata, greatly differing in age. According to the great orientalist Max Muller four periods each presupposing the preceding can be distinguished. They are :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(a) The Chandas and Mantras composing the Samhitās or collections of hymns, prayers, incantations, benedictions, sacrificial formulas, and litanies comprising the four Vedas : The Rk, Sara, Yajus, and Atharva.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(b) The Brāhmaṇas which are prose texts containing theological matter, particularly observations on sacrifices and their mystical significances ; attached to the Brāhmaṇas, but reckoned also as independent works are the Aranyakas or Upaniṣads containing meditations of forest hermits and ascetics on God, the world, and mankind. These treatises are attached to each of the individual Vedas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(c) The Sutras or Aphorisms, or Vedangas. Vedāngas&amp;rsquo;, lit. limbs of Vedas, are post-Vedic Sūtra or aphorism literature which grew as results of attempts to understand the Vedas in their various aspects, and sometimes to develop the ideas contained in the Vedas. According to the orthodox view, there are six Vedāngas as follows:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(1) Śikṣā : or phonetics; texts explaining how the Vedic literature proper is to be pronounced, and memorized.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(2) Kalpa : or ritualistic literature, of which four types are known : Srauta Sutras dealing with sacrifices ; Grhya Sutras dealing with domestic duties of a householder ; Dharma Sūtras dealing with religious and social laws; Sūlva Sūtras dealing with the construction of sacrificial altars.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(3) Vyakarana or Grammar, e.g., Panini&amp;rsquo;s famous Aṣtādhyāyī, which once for all fixed up the Sanskrit language. The Aṣtādhyāyi is however the culmination of attempts by large number of older authors, whose works were rendered obsolete by Panini&amp;rsquo; masterpiece.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(4) Nirukta or Etymology: explanation of the Vedic words ascribed to one Yaska, who lived before Pānini.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(5) Chandas-Metrics ascribed to Pingala.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(6) Jyotiṣa-Astronomy: the Rg-Jyotiṣa is ascribed to one Lagadha, of whom nothing is known.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only the sixth Vedanga or Jyotisa interests us, though there are occasional references to the calendar in all Sātra literatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These practices often produce a bewildering confusion in fixing up dates and moments of observance of the religious festivals, of which some detailed examples are given later. The Calendar Reform Committee was asked to make a study of the various Hindu religious calendars, and recommend to the Government a Unified National Calendar for Hindu religious purposes for the whole of India. The Committee has now finished its labours, and presents its report to the Government. The main points are summarized below:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;moon gains on the sun&lt;/strong&gt; at the average rate of 12.2° per day, but it did not take the ancients long to discover that the daily gain of the moon on the sun is far from uniform ; in fact as we know now, it varies from approximately &lt;strong&gt;10.75° to 14.5° per day&lt;/strong&gt;. It was therefore not possible to say beforehand whether the crescent moon would appear on the 29th or on the 30th day after the beginning of the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EMPIRICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE YEAR AND THE MONTH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solar year has thus a pretty nearly constant value, but even the earliest astronomers appear to have observed, that the lunation, or the synodic period of the moon is not a constant, but is variable. As a matter of fact, the period varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days-nearly fourteen hours. The observation of the actual motion of the moon formed the most formidable problem in ancient astronomy (vide §4).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The three events mentioned in (1), (2) and (3) above define the natural divisions of time. They are :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Day: defined by the alternation of daylight and night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Month : the complete cycle of moon&amp;rsquo;s changes of phase, from end of mew-moon to next end of new moon (amānta months), or end of full-moon to end of next full-moon (Pūrṇimānta months).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Year : and its smaller subdivisions, viz., the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of the calendar in Egypt has been given in full, because the ancient Egyptians evolved a very simple and convenient calendar which, as mentioned before, would have been almost perfect (provided the year was taken to consist of 365 1/4 days instead of 365 days). This was rendered possible by their bold initiative of discarding the moon as a time-marker. But people in the remaining parts of the civilized world (e.g., in Babylon, Greece, India and China) in ancient and moderm times, retained the moon and preferred the more complex luni-solar calendars described in Chap. III. This was rather fortunate, for if their rulers had adopted the Egyptian calendar, the &lt;strong&gt;priest astronomers of ancient nations&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly of Babylon, &lt;strong&gt;would never have taken to observation of the sun, the moon, and the planets, and tried to evolve mathematical formulae for predicting&lt;/strong&gt; their positions amongst stars in advance (the Ephemerides), which form the basis on which our astronomical knowledge has been built up; for the Egyptian calendar was evolved simply from results of experiences extending over centuries, and required almost no astronomical sense, or observations either of the sun, the moon and stars, except the heliacal rising of Sirius. It was simple and convenient, but like many perfect things, it killed intellectual curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOME explanation may be necessary for the publication of an essay on the antiquity of the Vedas by one whose professional work lies in a different direction. About four years ago, as I was reading the Bhagavad Gita, it occurred lo me that we might derive important conclusions from the statement of Krishna that &amp;ldquo;he was Margashirsha of the months.&amp;rdquo; This led me to inquire into the primitive Vedic calendar, and the result of four years&amp;rsquo; labour is now placed before the public. The essay was originally written for the Ninth Oriental Congress held in London last year. But it was found too large to be inserted in the proceedings wherein its summary alone is now included. I have had therefore to publish it separately, and in doing so I have taken the opportunity of incorporating into it such additions, alterations and modifications, as were suggested by further thought and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;solar-months-religious&#34;&gt;Solar months (Religious)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(5) The calculation of solar ( saura ) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name, will start 23° 15&amp;rsquo; ahead of the vernal equinoctial point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saura Vaiśākha commences when the Sun has the longitude of 23° 15&amp;rsquo; 0&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jyestha 53 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aṣāḍha 83 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Śrāvana 113 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhādrapada 143 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Āśvina 173 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kārtika 203 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mārgasirsa 233 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pauṣa 263 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Māgha 293 150&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Phālguna 323 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caitra 353 15 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This recommendation is to be regarded only as a measure of compromise, so that we avoid a violent break with the established custom. But it does not make our present seasons in the various months as they were in the days of Varahamihira or Kalidasa. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER II — The Figure in Finland&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NOW THE DISCUSSION leaps, without apologies, over the impassable fence erected by modern philologists to protect the linguistic family of Indo-European languages from any improper dealings with strange outsiders. It is known that Finland, Esthonia and Lapland are a cultural island, ethnically related to the Hungarians and to other faraway Asian peoples: Siryenians, Votyaks, Cheremissians, Mordvinians, Voguls, Ostyaks. They speak languages which belong to the Ugro-Finnish family, as totally unrelated to Germanic as Basque would be. These languages are described as &amp;ldquo;agglutinative&amp;rdquo; and often characterized by vowel harmonization, such as is found in Turkish. These cultural traditions until quite recently were segregated from the Scandinavian environment. Even if Western culture — and Christianity with it seeped through among the literati from the Middle Ages on their great epic, the Kalevala, remained intact, entrusted as it was to oral transmission going back in unchanged form to very early times. It shows arrestingly primitive features, so primitive that they discourage any attempt at a classical derivation. It was collected in writing only in the 19th century by Dr. Elias Lonnrot. But even in this segregated tradition, startling parallels were found with Norse and Celtic myth, which must go back to times before their respective recorded histories. The main line of the poem will be dealt with later. Here, it is important to look at the story of Kullervo Kalevanpoika (&amp;ldquo;the son of Kaleva&amp;rdquo;), which has been carefully analyzed by E. N. Setala in his masterly inquiry &amp;ldquo;Kullervo-Hamlet.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ज्यौतिषवेदाङ्गम् याजुषाचार्यः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PREFATORY NOTE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Vaidics admit that Jyautisha (the science of astronomy or astrology)&#xA;relates to both the Vedas, the Yajur and the Rig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as the Vaidics recite by rote the Vaidic hymns, so do they repeat&#xA;Jyautisha. Thus, owing to the recitation of the Vedas in hereditary&#xA;succession without the knowledge of their meaning and the circulation of&#xA;incorrect readings, all the copies of Jyautishavedanga that are&#xA;now-a-days procurable, havë been unduly spoilt and given rise to&#xA;incoherent signification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;चौ. श्रीनारायण सिंह&#xA;संस्कृत भाषा में ज्योतिष शब्द स्त्रीलिंग है। इस शब्द का अर्थ प्रकाश, प्रभा, चमक, दीप्ति किया गया है। “द्युत् द्योतने&amp;rsquo; धातु से इसकी व्युत्पत्ति की जाती है। सूर्य चन्द्रादि ग्रहों की गति एवं उनके फलादि का विचार करने वाले शास्त्र को &amp;lsquo;ज्योतिषि&amp;rsquo; शब्द से व्यवहृत किया गया है।&#xA;वेद के छः अंग माने जाते हैं।&amp;rsquo;&#xA;शिक्षा, कल्प व्याकरण, निरुक्त, छन्द एवं ज्योतिष इन छ: वेदांगों का वेद पुरुष के अंगों के साथ शास्त्रों के सम्बन्ध को दर्शाते हुए कहा गया है&#xA;कि छन्दशास्त्र वेद के पैर, कल्प हाथ, ज्योतिष नेत्र, निरुक्त कर्ण, शिक्षा ध्राण एवं व्याकरण मुख है। इन छ: अंगों के साथ ही वेद का अध्ययन करने वाले को ब्रह्मलोक में प्रतिष्ठा प्राप्त होती है।&#xA;मन्वर्थमुक्तावली में कहा गया है कि वेदों से ही चारों वर्ण, तीनों लोक एवं चार आश्रमों तथा भूतकाल, वर्तमान एवं भविष्य काल की सभी बातें सिद्ध होती हैं। पितरों देवों एवं मनुष्यों के लिये त्रैकालिक घटनाओं के ज्ञानार्थ वेद नेत्र स्वरूप है। किन्तु वेदों का नेत्र ज्योतिष शास्त्र है, जिससे अतीन्द्रिय दिव्यज्ञान प्राप्त होता है। इस कथन के औचित्य को दर्शते हुए कहा गया है कि अन्य शास्त्रों में केवल विवाद होता है क्योंकि उनमें प्रतिपादित अनेक तत्व प्रत्यक्ष नहीं दिखलायी पड़ते। किन्तु, ज्योतिष शास्त्र प्रत्यक्ष है, क्योंकि इसमें सूर्य एवं चन्द्रमा साक्षी होते हैं।&#xA;(१) ब्रह्मा, (२) आचार्य, (३) वसिष्ठ, (४) अत्रि, (५) मनु, (६) पौलस्त्य, (७) रोमश, (८) मरीचि, (६) अंङिरा, (१०) व्यास, (११) नारद, (१२) शौनक, (१३) भृगु, (१४) च्यवन, (१५) यवन, (१६) गर्ग, (१७) कश्यप एवं (१८) पराशर - ये अट्ठारह ज्योतिषशास्त्र के प्रवर्तक हैं।&#xA;१. शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्द एव च। ज्योतिषञ्च षडगानि कथितानि मनीषिभिः ।। २. छन्दः पादौ तु वेदस्य हस्तो कल्पोऽथ पठ्यते। ज्योतिषामयनं चक्षुः निरुक्तं श्रोत्रमुच्यते।।&#xA;शिक्षा घ्राणं तु वेदस्य मुखं व्याकरणं स्मृतम्। तस्मात् साङ्गमधीत्यैव ब्रह्मलोके महीयते।। ३. चातुर्वर्ण्य त्रयो लोकाश्चत्वारश्चाश्रमाः पृथक्। भूतं भव्यं भविष्यञ्च सर्व वेदात्प्रसिद्ध्यति।।&#xA;पितृदेवमनुष्याणां वेदः चक्षुः सनातनम्। तच्चक्षुज्योतिष शास्त्रं दिव्यं ज्ञानमतीन्द्रियम् ।। ४. अप्रत्यक्षाणि सशास्त्राणि विवादस्तेषु केवलम्। प्रत्यक्षं ज्योतिष शस्त्रं चन्द्रार्को यत्र साक्षिणौ ।।&#xA;ब्रह्माचार्यों वसिष्ठोऽत्रिर्मनुः पौलस्त्यरोमशौ। मरीचिरङिरा व्यासों नारद: शौनको भृगुः ।। च्चवनो यवनो गर्गः कश्यपश्च पराशरः। अष्टादशैते गम्भीरा ज्योतिः शास्त्रप्रवर्तकाः ।।&#xA;५.&#xA;न१०&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड सभी भारतीय शास्त्रों के आदि प्रवर्तक ब्रह्मा ही माने जाते हैं। क्योंकि सृष्टि की इच्छा होने पर चेतन स्वरूप अनादि-अनन्त परब्रह्म के संकल्प से ही सर्वप्रथम आदिपुरुष पितामह ब्रह्मा का अविर्भाव हुआ एवं उन्हें ही ज्ञानमय वेदों का उपदेश ईश्वर से प्राप्त हुआ। तत्पश्चात् ब्रह्मा ने ही वसिष्ठ एवं नारद इत्यादि अपने मानस पुत्रों को वेदों का उपदेश दिया।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, apart from the circumstance that the snowy burial ascribed to the followers of Kai Khusrau, Enoch, and Quetzalcouatl could hardly be claimed to be an &amp;ldquo;obvious&amp;rdquo; feature, the fate of Quetzalcouatl&amp;rsquo;s companions might further our understanding; more correctly, the topos where this event is supposed to have happened might do so. The &amp;ldquo;five mountains&amp;rdquo; of Mexican myth, their &amp;ldquo;gods&amp;rdquo; respectively, the &lt;em&gt;Tepictoton&lt;/em&gt;, [1]  appear to represent the five Uayeb (= Maya; with the Aztecs: Nemontemi), the Epagomena, those days gained by Mercury from the Moon during a game of checkers, in order to help Rhea/Nut to days &amp;ldquo;outside of the year,&amp;rdquo; when she could bring forth the five planets. As a matter of fact, in his chapter on the clothes and emblems of the gods, Sahagún puts the &amp;ldquo;Mountain-Gods&amp;rdquo; at the end of the list. [2]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Chaldeans, many other nations of antiquity, viz..the Vedic Indians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews and others used the luni-solar calendar, and had to make luni-solar adjustments. It will be tedious to relate how they did it, except in the case of the Vedic Indians (vide § 5). But the knowledge of the nineteen-year rule appears to have diffused to all countries by the first century of the Christian era. From this time onwards, the lunar months of different nations appear to be interchange able. This is shown in the following Table No. 4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;role&#34;&gt;Role&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Atharva Veda consisting mostly of magic incantations also contain calendaric references, but we shall make only occasional use of them, as the text of this Veda has not probably come to us in unadulterated form, for the Atharva Veda was not regarded as holy as the Rg-Veda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the two other Vedas, the Sama-Vedas contain no new matter than what is contained in the Rg-Veda. But there are copious calendaric reference in the Yajurveda for obvious reasons, which are clearly brought out in the following extracts from Winternitz&amp;rsquo;s introductry remarks to Yajurvedic studies (p. 158-159) :&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(10) Steps should be taken to compile an &amp;ldquo;Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac&amp;rdquo; by the Government of India, showing in advance, the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar-both civil and religious prepared according to the above recommendations should be included in that publication every year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A permanent Standing Committee to be called the Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac Committee may be constituted for this purpose and attached to a scientific department of the Government of India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hindu solar month-lengths vary from 29 to 32, as the time of passing 30° of the ecliptic varies, accord ing to older data given in the Sūrya Siddhānta from 29.32 days to 31.64 days. These varying lengths, as is well-known, can be understood only from Kepler&amp;rsquo;s first two laws, which were explained fully by Newton in 1687 on the basis of dynamics and law of universal gravitation, but these laws and their explanation were unknown to astronomers in 400 A.D. Further these month-lengths are different in the three Siddhāntas be cause they were calculated according to three different formulæ. On account of the ignorance of Kepler&amp;rsquo;s laws. and of the shift of the equinoctial lines in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit ( vide C § 5:6) the ancient astronomers probably assumed that the times of passage through 30° as calculated according to formulæ given by them would be valid for all times. But we now know this assumption to be incorrect, and cannot stick to the lengths as given in the Siddhāntas, which also differ amongst themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Observations of the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and stars are now made very accurately with elaborate instruments installed in observatories. But these instruments have been evolved after thousands of years of experience and application of human ingenuity, and have undergone radical changes in design and set-up with every great technological discovery. But let us see how the early astronomers who had no instruments or very primitive ones made observations, collected the fundamental data, and evolved the basic astronomical ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The great Iranian conqueror Darius (520 B. C.), whose empire comprised Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and Asia Minor, besides his native country of Iran, certainly came into contact with the diverse calendars of older civilizations, but he appears to have &lt;strong&gt;preferred the Egyptian calendar&lt;/strong&gt; to the more complex Babylonian calendar, and introduced it in his vast empire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the astronomers of Darius made correction of the deficit of 1 day of the year in another way. They had all years of 365 days, but used an &lt;strong&gt;interaclary month of 30 days in a cycle of 120 years&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER III — The Iranian Parallel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For from today new feasts and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;customs date,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because tonight is born Shah Kai&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Khusrau&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shahnama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE HAMLET THEME moves now to Persia. Firdausi&amp;rsquo;s Shahnama, the Book of Kings, is the national epic of Iran, [1]  and Firdausi (ca. A.D. 1010) is still today the national poet. At the time Firdausi wrote, his protector, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna, had shifted the center of his power to India, and the Iranian empire had long been only a memory. With prodigious scholarship, Firdausi, like Homer before him, undertook to organize and record the Zendic tradition, which extended back from historic times into the purely mythical. The first section on the Pishdadian and Kaianian dynasties must be considered mythical throughout, although it does reach into historic times and encompasses four of the nine volumes of the Book of Kings in the English translation. Khusrau (Chosroes in Greek) is also the name of a line of historical rulers, one of whom, Khusrau Anushirvan, gave sanctuary to the last philosophers of Greece, the members of the Platonic Academy driven out by Justinian in A.D. 529. But Firdausi&amp;rsquo;s Kai Khusrau is the towering figure of his own mythical age. Almost one-fifth of the whole work is allotted to him. He is actually the Haosravah of the Zend Avesta and also the Rigvedic Sushravah, an identity which raises again the much discussed question of a common Indo-European &amp;ldquo;Urzeit&amp;rdquo;, the time of origins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whatever may be the correct lengths of the astronomical month and the year, for application to human life, the following points have to be observed in framing a civil calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(a) The civil year and the month must have an integral number of days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(b) The starting day of the year, and of the month should be suitably defined. The dates must correspond strictly to seasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(c) For purposes of continuous dating, an era should be used, and it should be properly defined.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(d) The civil day, as distinguished from the astronomical day, should be defined for use in the calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(e) If the lunar months have to be kept, there should be convenient devices for luni-solar adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A correct and satisfactory solution of these problems has not yet been obtained, though in the form of hundreds of calendars which have been used by different people of the world during historical times, we have so many attempted solutions. The early calendars were based on insufficient knowledge of the duration of the natural time cycles-day, month and year-and led to gross deviations from actual facts, which had to be rectified from time to time by the intervention of dictators like Julius Caesar, Pope Gregory XIII, or a founder of religion like Mohammed, or by great monarchs like Melik Shah the Seljuk, or Akber, the great Indian emperor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

केवल आकाश ही है जो उसको जानता होगा परन्तु वह भी उसको जानता है या नहीं, इसको कौन जानता है? इस सृष्टि के विषय में जितने सम्प्रदाय हैं उतने ही विचार भी हैं। ऋग्वेद में ही कहा गया है कि असत् से सत् उत्पन्न हुआ और इसके अनन्तर दिशायें आदि।&#xA;वेदान्त में कहा गया है कि &amp;ldquo;तमः प्रधान विक्षेप शक्तिमदज्ञानोपहितचैतन्यादाकाशः आकाशाद्वायुयोरग्निरग्नेरापोऽभ्यः पृथिवी चोत्पद्यते” इत्यादि। अर्थात् तमस् प्रधान विक्षेप शक्तिमदज्ञानोपहित चैतन्य से आकाश, आकाश से वायु, वायु से अग्नि, अग्नि से जल, जल से पृथ्वी उत्पन्न हुई। वेदों तथा उपनिषदों में ब्रह्माण्ड का वर्णन सम्यक् प्रकार से कई स्थानों पर दिखाई देता है। वैदिक साहित्य के इतर भी ब्रह्माण्ड का वर्णन विस्तृत रूप से मिलता है। आदिकाल से ही मनुष्यों के पास विश्वोत्पत्ति के रहस्य को जानने की&#xA;१. नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु।&#xA;ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह ।। प्रोद्यमाने जगन्नाथे सर्वलोकनमस्कृतम् । कौसल्या जनयद्रामं दिव्यलक्षणसंयुतम् ।। पुष्ये जातस्तु भरतो मीनलग्ने प्रसन्नधीः । सार्पे जातौ तु सौमित्री कुलीरेऽभ्युदिते रवौ ।। (बालकाण्ड, १८/६, १० तथा १५)&#xA;१. तैत्तिरीय ब्राह्मण ३६११४१ २. को अद्धा वेद क इह प्रवोचत् कुत आजाता कुत इयं विसृष्टिः। अर्वाग्देवा अस्य विसर्जनेनाऽथा को&#xA;वेद यत आबभूव ।। १०६१२६/६, इयं विसृष्टिर्यत आबभूव यदि वा दधे यदि वा न। यो अस्याध्यक्षः परमे व्योमन् सो अङ्ग वेद यदि वा न वेद ।। १०/१२६/७&#xA;२३&#xA;२२&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड मुख्यतः दो प्रविधियां उपलब्ध थीं जिसमें पहली प्रविधि का नाम अध्यात्म तथा दूसरी प्रविधि का नाम भौतिक विज्ञान था। आध्यात्म विज्ञान में योग एवं दिव्य दृष्टि के द्वारा समग्र ज्ञान प्राप्त होता था जबकि भौतिक प्रविधि में पञ्चज्ञानेन्द्रिय गम्य ज्ञान ही प्राप्त हो सकता है। इनसे इतर विषयों का ज्ञान इस प्रविधि के द्वारा संभव नहीं है। यह ध्रुव सत्य है क्योंकि भौतिक प्रविधि का अधिकतर ज्ञान परीक्षण शालाओं पर आधारित रहता है। जहां परीक्षण शालाओं की सीमा समाप्त होती है, वहीं से अध्यात्म विज्ञान की सीमा प्रारंभ होती है। इसी लिए अध्यात्म विज्ञान ने ‘यत् पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे&amp;rsquo; के सिद्धान्त के द्वारा ही समस्त जगत् के रहस्य को समझा और समझाने को प्रयत्न किया। भारतीय चिन्तन धारा के आधार पर ब्रह्माण्डोत्पत्ति ज्ञान को मुख्यतः चार भागों में विभक्त किया गया था।&#xA;१. विश्वकर्मा द्वारा ब्रह्माण्ड की उत्पत्ति-&amp;lsquo;इयं विसृष्टिर्यत आ वभूव&amp;hellip;..।&amp;rsquo; ऋग्वेद के अनुसार परमेश्वर ही सृष्टि में स्रष्टा (बनाने वाले) हैं। परमेश्वर के गुणों की संज्ञा ही देवता है। ब्रह्माण्ड का सृजन देवताओं ने ही किया है। वे देवता हैं विश्वकर्ता, विष्णु, सविता, इन्द्र, वरुण आदि। ये देवता सृष्टि निर्माण में विभिन्न कार्य करते हैं। इन्हीं के सहयोग से ब्रह्माण्ड निर्माण का कार्य पूर्ण हुआ। सृजन में जिस पदार्थ का उपयोग हुआ इन देवताओं ने उसको अंतरिक्ष धूलि मेघ कहा जिसको आधुनिक वैज्ञानिक ‘कॉस्मिक डस्ट&amp;rsquo; के नाम से जानते हैं।&#xA;२. विराट्र पुरुष द्वारा ब्रह्माण्ड की उत्पत्ति-विराट पुरुष को ही लोग समग्र विश्व की आत्मा मानते हैं। संपूर्ण ब्रह्माण्ड का यह शरीर (विराट स्वरूप) बीज मात्र है अर्थात् जैसे प्रत्येक वृक्ष के सूक्ष्म बीज में एक विशाल वृक्ष समाया रहता है उसी प्रकार एक ब्रह्माण्ड की सूक्ष्म इकाई में विराट ब्रह्माण्ड का स्वरूप समाहित रहता है। विराट पुरुष के अंगों से ही पृथ्वी, आकाश वायु, सूर्य, चन्द्र, मनुष्य आदि जीवों के साथ ही पार्थिव तत्व की भी उत्पत्ति होती है। ‘पुरुष एवेदं सर्वं यद् भूतं यच्च भाव्यम् ।&amp;lsquo;३&#xA;३. ब्रह्मा द्वारा ब्रह्माण्डोत्पत्ति-ऋग्वेद के नासदीय सूक्त&amp;rsquo; में वर्णन मिलता है कि सृष्टि के आदि में न &amp;lsquo;सत्&amp;rsquo; था और न &amp;lsquo;असत्&amp;rsquo; था, न आकाश था, न वायुमण्डल था, न दिन था, न रात्रि थी।&#xA;_ ऋग्वेद के १०वें मण्डल के १६०वें सूक्त में विशेष वर्णन मिलता है कि जाज्वल्यमान परम तेज से ऋत (सत्य) की उत्पत्ति हुई। इसके पश्चात् आकाश तथा आकश से अनन्त परमाणुओं की सृष्टि हुई तब पदार्थ का सृजन हुआ।&#xA;भुवनकोश ४. प्रजापति द्वारा ब्रह्माण्डोत्पत्ति-स्वयंभू परमेश्वर ने सर्वप्रथम विश्वोत्पत्ति के लिए प्रजापति की सृष्टि की। श्रुतियों में प्रजापति को ही हिरण्यगर्भ कहा गया है, यथा &amp;lsquo;हिरण्यगर्भः समवर्तताग्रे भूतस्य जातः पतिरेक आसीत्&amp;rsquo; । हिण्यगर्भ ही एक ऐसी अवस्था है जहां से आज के वैज्ञानिक को सृष्टि प्रक्रिया ठीक से समझ आती है। क्यों जब तेज (इनर्जी) हिरण्यगर्भ के रूप में परिणत होता है तभी विस्फोट होता है। विस्फोट के पूर्व की स्थिति ही हिरण्यगर्भ है। कह सकते हैं कि तेज़ की एक स्थिति (अवस्था) का नाम ही हिरण्यगर्भ है। शतपथ ब्राह्मण में इसी प्रसंग में हिरण्यगर्भ को &amp;lsquo;अर्ध&amp;rsquo; ज्योति कहा गया है। यथा- &amp;lsquo;ज्योतिर्वै हिरण्यम ज्योतिरेषोऽमतं हिरण्यम। निश्चित ही &amp;lsquo;हिरण्यम&amp;rsquo; एक अखण्ड मूल तत्वरूप ज्योति है। अमरकोशकार ने हिरण्यगर्भ का निर्वचन इस प्रकार किया है। यथा- &amp;lsquo;हिरण्यं हिरण्यमयं अण्डं तस्य गर्भ इव&amp;rsquo;। अर्थात् ज्योतिर्मय पिण्ड जिसके गर्भ में है वह हिरण्यगर्भ हुआ। वैदिक साहित्य में हिरण्यगर्भ का विवेचन विस्तृत रूप से उपलब्ध होता है।&#xA;वेद दर्शन एवं विज्ञान संबंधी रहस्यों के आगार हैं किन्तु वैदिक साहित्य की भाषा परोक्ष प्रतीकात्मक, संकेतात्मक अलंकारों एवं रूपकों से परिपूर्ण है। सामान्यतया वैदिक मन्त्रों के अर्थ एवं भाव समझ में नहीं आते हैं क्योंकि वेदों के भी अपने प्रतीक हैं। वेद की परिकल्पनाओं के प्रतिपादन मे प्रतीकों का महत्वपूर्ण योगदान है। वेदों के भाव एवं अर्थ को समझाने से पूर्व प्रतीकों को समझना आवश्यक है।&#xA;सामान्यतया जहां ग्रह, नक्षत्र, तारे, दैत्य, मानव, देवतादि समस्त जीव एवं भूर्भुवादि चतुर्दश लोकों का एक समन्वित स्वरूप परिकल्पित होता है उसे ही ब्रह्माण्ड कहते हैं। यह भी कह सकते हैं कि चतुर्दश लोकों के समूह को ही ब्रह्माण्ड कहते हैं। ज्योतिष शास्त्र के अनुसार एक सौर मण्डल को भी एक ब्रह्माण्ड कहा जाता है। सूर्य सिद्धान्त में कहा गया है कि “आकशकक्षा सा ज्ञेया करव्याप्तिस्तथा रवेः&amp;rsquo; इस प्रकार के अनेक सौर मण्डल हैं। वेदों में चतुर्दश लोकों का वर्णन &amp;lsquo;रोदसी&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;कन्दसी&amp;rsquo; एवं संयती के रूप में मिलता है। इस ब्रह्माण्ड में स्थित सात उर्ध्व लोकों एवं सात अधः लोकों का प्रकारान्तर से जो वर्णन शतपथ ब्राह्मण में मिलता है वैसा अन्य किसी भी ग्रन्थ में नहीं मिलता है। गार्गी और याज्ञवल्क्य ऋषि के संवाद में कई लोकों का उल्लेख मिलता है। “कस्मिन्न खलु वायुरोतश्च प्रोतश्चेत्यन्तरिक्षलोकेषु गार्गीति कस्मिन्नु खल्वन्तरिक्षलोका ओताश्च प्रोताश्चेत्यादयः&amp;quot;३ __इसके अतिरिक्त वेदों में घु-अन्तरिक्ष पृथ्वी का पृथक-पृथक वर्णन मिलता है। समग्र विश्व के विषय में कुछ कहते समय रोदसी, द्यावापृथिवी (आकाश और पृथ्वी) को इंगित&#xA;१. ऋग्वेद संहिता १०/१२६/७ २. ऋग्वेद संहिता १०/८१-७, ऋग्वेद संहिता १०/८२/१.७&#xA;ऋग्वेद संहिता १०/६०/०२, साम ६१६, अथर्व १६, ६, ४ शुक्लयजु सं० ३१/१२ ४. ऋग्वेद १०/१२६/१.७ ५. ऋग्वेद १०/१६०/३, वृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् २/६/२०, विष्णुपुराण १/२/२३&#xA;१. यजुर्वेद संहिता १३/१४, ६०/१६ ऋग्वेद १०/१२१/१.७ २. शतपथ ब्राह्मण ६/७ ३. शतपथ ब्राह्मण १४/६/६/१&#xA;२४&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;करके किया हुआ वर्णन बहुत से स्थलों में पाया जात है। इससे ज्ञान होता है कि विश्व के दो भाग माने गये हैं परन्तु कहीं-कहीं धुलोक तीन बताये गये हैं। अधिकांश स्थलों पर धु-अंतरिक्ष और पृथ्वी विश्व के तीन विभाग माने गये हैं। धु और पृथ्वी के बीच को ही अन्तरिक्ष कहा गया है। इसी मे वायु मेध एवं विद्युत का स्थान है तथा इसी में पक्षी भी उड़ते हैं।&#xA;नाभ्या आसीदन्तरिक्षं शीर्णोद्यौः समवर्तत पद्भ्यां भूमिः।&amp;rsquo;&#xA;पुरुष सूक्त की इस ऋचा में तीनों विभाग स्पष्ट रूप में परिलक्षित होते हैं। संभवतः उक्त लोकों की ऊर्ध्वाधः स्थिति को ध्यान में रखकर ही विराट् पुरुष के मस्तक, नाभि एवं पादों से इनकी उत्पतित की कल्पना की गयी। ऋग्वेद के एक प्रसंग में इस प्रकार वर्णन मिलता है कि &amp;lsquo;जिसने कांपती हुई पृथ्वी दृढ़ की, जिसने विस्तीर्ण अन्तरिक्ष को व्यवस्थित किया जिसने द्यु को धारण किया है मनुष्यों/वह इन्द्र है। जैमिनीय ब्राह्मण में सात लोकों का वर्णन व नाम इस प्रकार मिलता है यथा- उपोदक, ऋतधामा, अपराजित, अभिद्यु, प्रद्यु, रोचन, विष्टप (ब्रह्मलोक)। एक अन्य प्रसंग में जैमिनीय ब्राह्मण में ही लोकों का क्रम - उपोदक, ऋतधामा, शिव, अपराजित, अभिद्य, प्रद्य, तथा रोचन कहा गया है। रोचन पद दीप्ति वाचक है। यह सूर्य (रोचन) लोक और उससे प्रदीप्त लोकों का भी वाचक है। शतपथ ब्राह्मण के कथनानुसार आदि में सूर्य, चन्द्र आदि लोक सुस्थिर न होने के कारण पहले कांपते थे। बहुत काल पश्चात् ये लोक नियमित गतियों में प्रतिष्ठित हुए-तद् यथा ह वै। इदं रथचक्रं वा कौलालचक्रं वा प्रतिष्ठितं क्रन्देद एवं हैवेमा लोका अध्रुवा अप्रतिष्ठिता आसुः। स ह प्रजापतिरीक्षञ्चक्रे। कथनिन्ववमे लोका ध्रुवाः इमाम् अदृहदं वायोभिश्च मरीचिभिश्चान्तरिक्षम्। जीमूतैश्च नक्षत्रैश्च दिवम् ।६।&#xA;_ तब जैसे यह रथ का चक्र वा कुम्हार का चक्र अस्थिर क्रन्दन करता है, ऐसे ही ये लोक अध्रुव और अप्रतिष्ठित थे। उस प्रजापति ने ईक्षण किया कि कैसे ये लोक ध्रुव तथा प्रतिष्ठित हों। उसने इन पर्वतों और नदियों से इस पृथ्वी को दृढ़ किया। वायु और मरीचियों (रश्मियों) ने अन्तरिक्ष लोक को तथा जीमूतों और नक्षत्रों ने दिव लोक को दृढ़ किया।&#xA;भुवनकोश&#xA;२५ शतपथ ब्राह्मण एवं जैमिनीय ब्राह्मण के वर्णन से लोकों के विषय में एक वैशिष्ट्य दृष्टिगोचर होता है। यहां सूर्य, चन्द्र के अलग-अलग लोकों के रूप में वर्णन मिलता है तथा ब्राह्मण के वर्णन से ज्ञात होता है कि सूर्य चन्द्र के साथ ही भूभ्रमण की अवधारणा भी स्पष्ट होती है। जहां बादल एवं विद्युत का स्थान पृथ्वी के समीप ही है जबकि सूर्य, चन्द्र, नक्षत्रादि तेजवान् पुञ्जों का स्थान पृथ्वी से दूरतर है।&#xA;__ स्वर्गमृत्युपातालादि लोकों का वर्णन वेदों में प्रायः नहीं मिलता है परन्तु पौराणिक साहित्य में सप्तपाताल एवं सप्त उर्ध्व लोकों का वर्णन विशद रूप से उपलब्ध होता है।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is as yet too early in the day to deal with &amp;ldquo;Uncle Kamsa,&amp;rdquo; whom lexicographers make a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;mūra-deva&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; allegedly a &amp;ldquo;venerator of roots&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;mūla/mūra&lt;/em&gt; = root). In his &lt;em&gt;Kleine Beiträge&lt;/em&gt; (p. 11), Jarl Charpentier earnestly wishes us to accept as that &amp;ldquo;among the Indian natives fighting against the invading Aryans there were such,&amp;rdquo; namely, &amp;ldquo;venerators of roots&amp;rdquo; (and venerators of worms as well). Although we do not doubt that the species Homo sapiens is capable of any &amp;ldquo;belief,&amp;rdquo; we cannot perceive any cogent reason for subscribing to Charpentier&amp;rsquo;s view. &lt;em&gt;Mūla/mūra&lt;/em&gt;, the &amp;ldquo;root,&amp;rdquo; is a Nakshatra, a lunar mansion woven around with tales: it is the sting of Scorpius, serving as Marduk&amp;rsquo;s weapon in: the &amp;ldquo;Babylonian Genesis&amp;rdquo; and as Polynesian Maui&amp;rsquo;s fishhook; with the Copts it is &amp;ldquo;statio translationis Caniculae . . . unde et Siôt vocatur,&amp;rdquo; i.e., the Coptic table of lunar stations takes lambda upsilon Scorpii as the precise opposite of Sirius/Sothis, as we are informed by Athanasius Kircher, whereas Indian tables ascribe the role of exact opposition to Betelgeuse, ruled by &amp;ldquo;Rudra-the-destroying-archer.&amp;rdquo; Although we cannot pursue these and other tales further here, we think it at least appropriate to mention the concrete problems arising with such characters as &amp;ldquo;Uncle Kamsa,&amp;rdquo; instead of accusing a true Asura of &amp;ldquo;veneration of roots.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter IV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Persia &amp;ldquo;belongs&amp;rdquo; to Aries according to Paulus Alexandrinus. See Boll&amp;rsquo;s Sphaera, pp. 296f., where it is stated that this was the oldest scheme. It is still to be found in the Apocalypse. Moses&amp;rsquo; ram&amp;rsquo;s horns stand for the same world-age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his Seventh Letter (341C-344D) he denies strongly that scientific &amp;ldquo;names&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sentences&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;onomata, rèmata&lt;/em&gt;) could assist in obtaining essential insight. Cf. also Clemens Alexandrinus, &lt;em&gt;Stromata&lt;/em&gt; 5-9-58.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*. Still, there have been modern attempts deserving the name of myth. One, of course, is Sir Thomas More&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Utopia&lt;/em&gt;, which has taken on so much meaning through the centuries. We realize today that it, too, was partly oracular. And we should not forget &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;, the perfect nonsense myth, as significant and as nonsensical as the &lt;em&gt;Kalevala&lt;/em&gt;, itself. This parallel will appear relevant at the end of the appendices.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dissenting note to the report of the Committee by Dr K L Daftari&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the final report of the Committee dissenting only on the following point. I hold that the fixed nakṣatras, though regarded as enjoined by the dharmaśāstras should not be taken into consideration in fixing days of the religious functions, or the dharmaśāstras be regarded as enjoining the moving nakṣatras starting from a point 23° 15&amp;rsquo; ahead of the equinoctial point. I have given my reasons previously in my letters to the Chairman of the Committee, (a summary of which will be found as Annexure IV).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost all ancient nations were familiar with the night-sky either as shepherds, travellers or navigators, and were acquainted with more detailed knowledge of the revolving blue firmament studded with stars than the modern city dweller. The striking constelltions like the Great Bear, the Pleiades, the Orion could not but catch their fancy and references to these star groups are found in ancient literature, in the Vedas, in the book of Job (the Bible) and in Homer. In the last, the star-groups are used by sailors to find out their orientation. Representations of star-groups are found in ancient Babylonian boundary stones of about 1300 B.C. (see Fig. 15).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For pactical purposes, the day is divided into 24 hours, an hour into sixty, minutes and a minute into sixty seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-keeping-devices&#34;&gt;Time keeping devices&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 mean solar day=24 x 60 x 60 = 86,400 seconds. The subdivisions of time are measured by highly  developed mechanical contrivances (clocks, watches and chronometers), but they have come into use only during comparatively recent times. The ancient people used very primitive devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time-keeping apparatus of the ancients were the &lt;strong&gt;gnomon, the sundial, and the water-clock&lt;/strong&gt; or the clepsydra. The first two depend on the motion of the sun, and require correction. The water-clock which probably was first invented in Egypt, appears to have been used down to the time of Galileo, when the discovery of &lt;strong&gt;pendulum motion&lt;/strong&gt; led to the invention of clocks based on pendulum motion or use of the balance wheel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian calendar attracted the notice of the calendar committee of the French Revolutionary Government (1789-1795) who wanted to &lt;strong&gt;replace Religion by Reason&lt;/strong&gt;. The committee consisted, amongst others, the great mathematicians &lt;strong&gt;Laplace and Lagrange&lt;/strong&gt; and the poet d&amp;rsquo;Eglantine. Laplace proposed that the year 1250 A.D., when according to his calculations the equinoctial line was perpendicular to the apse line +++(=major axis)+++ of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit should be taken the starting point of the French Revolution Era in place of a hypothetical year of Christ&amp;rsquo;s birth. But the calendar committee did not agree with him but started the era of the glorious French revolution, with the autumnal equinox day of 1792 A.D., as this was nearest in date to the outbreak of the revolution. Sentiment proved stronger than cold scientific reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-eras&#34;&gt;Early eras&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For accurate date-recording, we require besides the month and the day, also a continuously running era. But the era came rather late in human history. We find dated records of kings in &lt;strong&gt;Babylon&lt;/strong&gt; from about 1700 B.C. (Kassite kings). They used &lt;strong&gt;regnal years&lt;/strong&gt;, lunar months, and the day of the lunar month. The &lt;strong&gt;ancient Egyptian&lt;/strong&gt; records do not use any era, but sometimes the &lt;strong&gt;regnal years&lt;/strong&gt;. But the use of regnal years is very inconvenient for purposes of exact chronology, because one has to locate the beginning of the reign of the king on the time-scale which often proves to be an extremely difficult problem, e.g., in India, Emperor &lt;strong&gt;Asoka used regnal years&lt;/strong&gt;, but it is a problem of nearly hundred years for archaeologists to find out the exact date of the commencement of his reign. This varies from 273 B.C. to 264 B.C.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 THE LUNAR CALENDAR :</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lunar calendar depends on the correct calculation of the moments of conjunction (Amāvasyā), opposition (Paurnamāsi) and of the tithis (i.e., the moments when the moon gains 12° or its integral multiple on the sun). The Indian calendar-makers use for this purpose the formulæ on lunar motion given in the three Siddhāntas. But as these are known to be inaccurate, they use certain corrections called bīja introduced by later Indian astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history of the Indian calendar from the end of the Yajurveda period to the beginning of the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period is very imperfectly known though there are plenty of calendaric references in the Brāhmanās, Sūtras, and the epic Mahābhārata and various literature. On time-scale, it extends from an unknown antiquity, which is set by some at 1300 B.C. to 900 A.D.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Vedānga Jyōtiṣa&lt;/strong&gt; is generally assigned to this period. It may be said to be a sort of collection of short aphorisms giving mathematical rules for fixing the calendar in advance, and is known in three versions : the Rg-Jyotiṣa consisting of 36 verses, attached to the Rg-Veda and ascribed to one Lagadha as mentioned earlier, the Yājuṣ Jyotiṣa attached to the Yajurveda and consisting of 43 verses, and there is a text ascribed to one Somakara, a commentator of unknown age of the Vedas. The dffferent texts contain about the same matter, but the verses are haphazardly arranged showing that the original texts have not come down to us in an unadulterated form. The number of independent verses in all the versions is not more than 49, and some of the verses have not been interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>०४ अयनांशचयनम्</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ayanAMsha used to determine nakShatra or lunar month in a particular ritual context should be determined from the vidhi-vAkya-s enjoining that particular ritual action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;apastamba-example&#34;&gt;Apastamba example&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take upAkarma. Apastamba says: &amp;ldquo;(आर्तव)श्रवणा(पूर्व)पक्ष ओषधीषु जातासु हस्तेन पौर्णमास्यां वा ऽध्यायोपाकर्म २&amp;rdquo;. So, when do saplings sprout? At the beginning of the (khArif) rainy season, around the summer solstice time in north India. This happened to be shrAvaNa around 1000BCE.  The crops don&amp;rsquo;t srout when xyz-ayanAMsha based month happens to be &amp;ldquo;shrAvaNa&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s when adhyAya-upAkarma should be celebrated. Effectively, the naxatra-chakra should be &amp;ldquo;tropicalized&amp;rdquo; so that shrAvaNa pUrNimA falls around the time of solstice. People who claim to follow Apastamba by celebrating sometime in August are the same sort of comedians (unwitting or otherwise) who would &amp;ldquo;show&amp;rdquo; arundhati at noon during faux-vivAha rituals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then take sarpabali. Apastamba says: &amp;ldquo;श्रावण्यां पौर्णमास्यामस्तमिते स्थालीपाकः ५ &amp;hellip; मार्गशीर्ष्यां पौर्णमास्यामस्तमिते स्थालीपाकः ३&amp;rdquo;, and recommends giving bali to sarpa-s between shrAvaNa pUrNimA and mArgashIrSha pUrNimA. The timing is again tuned to nature - rainy season is when snakes come out of their flooded homes, and incidence of snake bites increase. So, again, anyone more interested in the spirit as well as letter of the AchArya will offset the naxatra-chakra so that shrAvaNa falls around solstice time - yes, tropicalization again. It is again comical if people keep giving bali-s in December. (Of course, people can start saying that &amp;ldquo;sarpa-s&amp;rdquo; are not snakes and that it is some &amp;ldquo;yoga&amp;rdquo; to be out of sync with nature - but they&amp;rsquo;re welcome to their private universe.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;वयपरणदहरणम&#34;&gt;वायुपुराणोदाहरणम्&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, vAyupurANa says: मेषान्ते च तुलान्ते च भास्करोदयतः स्मृताः । मुहूर्त्ता दश पञ्चैव अहोरात्रिश्च तावती ।। ५०.१९५ ।। कृत्तिकानां यदा सूर्यः प्रथमांशगतो भवेत् । विशाखानां तथा ज्ञेयश्चतुर्थांशे निशाकरः।। ५०.१९६ ।। विशाखायां यदा सूर्यश् चरतेंऽशं तृतीयकम्। तदा चन्द्रं विजानीयात् कृत्तिकाशिरसि स्थितम् ।। ५०.१९७ ।। विषुवन्तं तदा विद्याद् एवम् आहुर् महर्षयः। &lt;strong&gt;सूर्येण विषुवं विद्यात् कालं सोमेन लक्षयेत्&lt;/strong&gt; ।। ५०.१९८ ।। The second half of the first verse clearly tells us that during equinox, it is expected that both day and night are of equal length (15 muhUrta-s).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The remainder goes on to tell us how the exact timing for the sadAchAra conduct described in succeeding verses are to be timed: A careful ritualist should first adjust ayanAmsha so that the sun at equinox appears in kRttikA as described, and then optionally (if one intends to emphasize lunar position more than day-night equality) await the time around the equinox day when (~full) moon is in vishAkhA (as per this ayanAMsha adjustment). This of course results in shifting the naxatras from the corresponding asterisms (eg. Pleiades).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This choice of ayanAMsha incidentally corresponds to the ritual requirements of yajurveda portions (such as the puNyanaxatra section of taittirIya brAhmaNa).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Instead of this, if starts off with some other ayanAMsha from some other context and goes then to deduce &amp;ldquo;equinox&amp;rdquo; based on it - that would be wrong-headed - like latching the horses behind the cart.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. सच्चिदानन्द मिश्र&#xA;स्वर विद्या के मूल प्रवर्तक भगवान् सदाशिव हैं। इसे सर्वसिद्धि प्रदायक विज्ञान कहा गया है। इसमें ज्योतिष योग तथा तन्त्रागम का समवेत मूलाधार प्रयुक्त होने से शिव-पार्वती संवाद के रूप में इसे अत्यन्त महत्व पूर्व मानने की परम्परा प्राचीनतम है।&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;सवर-एव-बरहमणड&#34;&gt;स्वर एवं ब्रह्माण्ड&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;अक्षर को अविनाशी कहा है। शब्द ब्रह्म से विश्वोत्पत्ति की अवधारणा निराधार नहीं है। भगवान शिव के अनुसार तत्वों से ब्रह्माण्ड की उत्पत्ति, तत्वगत परिवर्तन से ही परिवर्तन तथा तत्व में ही ब्रह्माण्ड का क्षय अथवा लय आदि समस्त क्रियायें तत्वों पर ही आधारित हैं। इस तथ्य की पुष्टि में वेद, आगम, सांख्य दर्शन, योग दर्शन, पौराणिक वाङ्मय प्रभृति अनेक प्रबल प्रमाण हैं।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is no key, and there are no principles from which a presentation can be deduced. The structure comes from a time when there was no such thing as a system in our sense, and it would be unfair to search for one. There could hardly have been one among people who committed all their ideas to memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the orthodox Indian calendar-maker still uses the old formulæ dating from 400 A.D., his calculations of the ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanacs, which are based on modern formulæ and are verified by actual observations as shown in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Original pdf here contains a list of discrepencies in tithi boundaries)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Indian calendar-makers are aware of these discrepancies, and give the ending moments of tithis according to the Nautical Almanac. But all of them give the moments of beginning and ending of lunar and solar eclipses according to the Nautical Almanac, as times calculated according to the Siddhāntas may be grossly inaccurate, and the mistakes would at once catch public attention and lower their prestige. In the words of one of our colleagues (Dr. Gorakh Prasad), these almanac-makers are like bicycle-riders riding without lamps, who get down from their cycles on street corners, just to avoid being caught by the Police.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;solar-calendars&#34;&gt;Solar calendars&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, the different ways of tackling the calendar problem in different centres of civilization have been described. We have described in Chap. II, the &lt;strong&gt;purely solar calendars&lt;/strong&gt;, in which the moon is altogether discarded as a time-marker. This practice originated in Egypt about 3000 B.C. These calendars require only a correct knowledge of the length of year, and are therefore comparatively simpler. They required very little or &lt;strong&gt;almost no knowledge of astronomy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we are undertaking a critical review of the references to the calendar in ancient inscriptions, because, from the point of view of accurate history, inscriptional records are far more valuable than any references in ancient scriptures or classics, as they are contemporary documents, which have remained unaltered since the framers left them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;* Sometimes inscriptions and copper plate records have been found to have been forged at a latter date but such instances are rare and can not escape detection by an experienced archaeologist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE APPARENT PATH OF THE SUN IN THE SKY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The apparent path of the sun in the sky is known in astronomical language as the ecliptic. It is a great circle cutting the celestial equator at an angle of ca 23.5° (exactly 23° 26&amp;rsquo; 43&amp;quot; in 1955, but the angle varies from 22° 35&amp;rsquo; to 24° 13&amp;rsquo;). This is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ecliptic is the most important reference circle in the heavens, and let us see how a knowledge of it was obtained in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of the Seleucidean era, the practice arose for a nation or a dynasty to start eras commemorating some great event in their national or dynastic life. The first in record is the Parthian era, and the story of its starting is well-known. The Seleucid emperors ruled the Near East from 312 B.C. imposing on the countries under their domination Greek culture, the Seleucidean era, and the Graeco Chaldean system of time-reckoning. About 250 B.C., there were wide-spread revolts against Seleucid rule in Bactria, in Parthia (Eastern Persia), and other parts of the Near East. The revolt in Parthia was led by one Arsaces and his brother Tiridates who belonged to an Iranian tribe, which had adopted Greek culture. To commemorate their liberation from Seleucidean rule, the Parthians introduced an era, beginning &lt;strong&gt;64 years after the Seleucid era (i.e. 248 B.C.)&lt;/strong&gt;. But at first this era (&lt;strong&gt;Arsacid era&lt;/strong&gt;) was only rarely used. The early Parthian emperors preferred to use on their coins the Seleucidean era, the Macedonian months, and the Graeco-Chaldean system of time reckoning inscribed in Greek letters. In the &lt;strong&gt;first century A.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, there was a &lt;strong&gt;Zoroastrian revival&lt;/strong&gt;, the S.E. was dropped in favour of the Parthian era and Pehlevi began to be used in place of Greek, though Macedonian month-names were still kept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(The Christian Calendar) What is now known as the Christian calendar, and used all over the world for civil purposes, had originally nothing to do with Christianity. It was, according to one view, originally the calendar of semi-savage tribes of Northern Europe, who started their year sometime before the &lt;strong&gt;beginning of Spring (March 1 to 25) and had only ten months of 304 days ending about the time of winter solstice (December 25)&lt;/strong&gt;, the remaining &lt;strong&gt;61 days&lt;/strong&gt; forming a period of &lt;strong&gt;hybernation&lt;/strong&gt; when no work could be done due to the onset of winter, and were not counted at all. The city state of Rome also had originally this calendar, but &lt;strong&gt;several corrections&lt;/strong&gt; were made by the Roman Governments at different epochs and the final shape was given to it by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.; the calendar so revised is known as the Julian calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was noticed by the great Orientalist James Darmesteter. The translators of Firdausi are not unaware of it, and they analyze the last phase of events as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They use a so-called sidereal zodiac, which consists of 12 equal-sized zodiac signs, too, but it is tied to some fixed reference point, i.e. usually some fixed star. These sidereal zodiac signs only roughly coincide with the sidereal zodiacal constellations, which are of variable size.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505&#34;&gt;SW&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sidereal planetary positions are usually computed from tropical positions using the equation: sidereal_position = tropical_position – ayanamsha(t) , where ayanamsha is the difference between the two (tropical and siderial) zodiacs at a given epoch.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505&#34;&gt;SW&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;अयनांश-सूचिः -  प्रारम्भस्थाने अयनांश-चिन्ता, Swiss Ephemeris सारः&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773508&#34;&gt;अत्र&lt;/a&gt;, सूचिर्&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephprg.htm#_Toc471829106&#34;&gt;अत्र&lt;/a&gt;।&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Info about Lahiri ayanAMsha there is slightly inaccurate, since the calendar reform committee recommended two ayanAMsha-s (one fixed - for official solar and lunar religious months, and another variable one for determining naxatra spans)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most popular Indian ayanAMshas adjust ecliptic coordinates so as to roughly place Spica/Citra at ecliptic longitude 180° or 0 Libra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tropicalization-सयनकरणम&#34;&gt;Tropicalization सायनीकरणम्&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, one sets the ayanAmsha to adjust for precession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. देवी प्रसाद त्रिपाठी&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;वैदिक वाङ्गमय में वास्तु का सामान्य अर्थ गृह या भवन है तथा विशेष अर्थ-गृह निर्माण हेतु उपयुक्त भूखण्ड। वास्तु शब्द की व्युत्पत्ति “वस्” वासे धातु से हुई है। यह “वस्&amp;rsquo; धातु किसी एक स्थान में वास करने की द्योतक है। उणादि सूत्र (वसेस्तुन् १-७८) के अनुसार इसमें &amp;lsquo;तुन्&amp;rsquo; प्रत्यय लगाया गया है। प्रथम अक्षर &amp;lsquo;व&amp;rsquo; के ह्रस्व &amp;lsquo;अ&amp;rsquo; को दीर्घ &amp;lsquo;आ&amp;rsquo; इसलिए किया गया है क्योंकि इस प्रत्यय को &amp;lsquo;णित्&amp;rsquo; माना जाता है। (अगारे णिच्च १-७६)। वास्तु का व्युत्पत्तिलभ्यार्थ है-वसन्त्यस्मिन्नितिवास्तुः। अर्थात् वह भवन जिसमें मनुष्य निवास करते हैं, उसे वास्तु कहते हैं।&#xA;वास्तु के वैदिक देवता का नाम वास्तोष्पति है। ऋग्वेद के दो सूक्तों में वास्तु तथा भवन पर शासन करने वाले देवता &amp;ldquo;वास्तोष्पति&amp;rsquo; से अपने सकल कल्याण की कामना से बार-बार प्रार्थना की गई है। ### वास्तु शास्त्र के प्रवर्तक प्राचीनाचार्य&#xA;वास्तु विद्या की शास्त्रीय परम्परा की प्राचीनता विभिन्न प्राचीन पौराणिक ग्रन्थों में संकलित वास्तु शास्त्रोंपदेष्टाओं के नामों की लम्बी-लम्बी सूचियों से स्वयं सिद्ध है। _मत्स्य पुराण की सूची में वास्तु शास्त्र के प्रवर्तक अठारह आचार्यों का नामोल्लेख मिलता है&#xA;भृगुरत्रिर्वसिष्ठश्च विश्वकर्मा मयस्तथा। नारदो नग्नजिच्चैव विशालाक्षः पुरन्दरः।। ब्रह्मा कुमारो नन्दीशः शौनको गर्ग एव च।&#xA;वासुदेवोऽनिरुद्धश्च तथा शुक्रबृहस्पती।। २५१, २-३.. . . अर्थात् १. भृगु २. अत्रि ३. वसिष्ठ ४. विश्वकर्मा ५. मय ६. नारद ७. नग्नजित् ८. विशालाक्ष ६. पुरन्दर १०. ब्रह्म ११. कुमार १२. नन्दीश १३. शौनक. १४. गर्ग १५. वासुदेव १६. अनिरुद्ध १७. शुक्र १८. बृहस्पति। ये अठारह वास्तुशास्त्रोपदेशक मत्स्यपुराण के अनुसार हुए हैं। “अग्नि पुराण&amp;rsquo; में वास्तुशास्त्रोपदेशकों की सूची इससे भी अधिक लम्बी है जिसमें पच्चीस आचार्यों के नामों का उल्लेख किया गया है।&#xA;व्यस्तानि मुनिभिर्लोके पञ्चविंशतिसंख्यया। हयशीर्षं तन्त्रमाद्यं तन्त्रं त्रैलोक्यमोहनम् ।।&#xA;१. ऋग्वेद, ७-५४ तथा ५५ सूक्त।&#xA;७७&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड वैभवं पौष्करं तन्त्रं प्रह्लादं गायेगालवम्। नारदीयं च सम्प्रश्नं शण्डिल्यं वैश्वकं तथा।। सत्योक्तं शौनकं तन्त्रं वसिष्ठं ज्ञान-सागरम्। स्वायम्भुवं कापिलञ्च तार्क्ष्य-नारायणीयकम् ।। आत्रेयं नारसिंहाख्यमानन्दाख्यं तथारुणकम्।&#xA;बौधायनं तथार्षं तु विश्वोक्तं तस्य सारतः। ३६. १-५. “मानसार&amp;rdquo; की सूची और भी लम्बी है जिसमें वास्तु शास्त्र के प्रवर्तक आचार्य बत्तीस गिनाये गए हैं&#xA;विश्वकर्मा च विश्वेशः विश्वसारः प्रबोधकः। वृतश्चैव मयश्चैव त्वष्टा चैव मनुर्नलः।। मानविन्मान-कल्पश्च मानसारो बहुश्रुतः। प्रष्टा च मानबोधश्च विश्वबोधो नयस्तथा।। आदिसारो विशालाक्षः विश्वकाश्यप एव च। वास्तुबोधो महातन्त्रों वास्तुविद्यापतिस्तथा।। पाराशरीयकश्चैव कालयूपो महाऋषिः। चैत्याख्यः चित्रकः आवर्यः साधकसारसहितः।&#xA;ते एव ऋषयः प्रोक्ता द्वात्रिंशति संख्यया।। ६८. ५-६. “विश्वकर्मा प्रकाश&amp;rsquo; में वास्तु के प्रवर्तक आचार्यों के बारे में संक्षिप्त उल्लेख है&#xA;इति प्रोक्तं वास्तुशास्त्रं पूर्वं गर्गाय धीमते। गर्गात्पराशरः प्राप्तस्तस्मात्प्राप्तो वृहद्रथः।। वृहद्रथाद्विश्वकर्मा प्राप्तवान् वास्तुशास्त्रकम्।&#xA;स एव विश्वकर्मा जगतो हितायाकथयत्पुनः।। इस प्रकार “विश्वकर्माप्रकाश&amp;quot; में उल्लिखित नामों के अनुसार गर्ग, पराशर, वृहद्रथ तथा विश्वकर्मा ये वास्तु शास्त्र के प्रवर्तक आचार्य हुए।&#xA;उपरोक्त विवरण से प्रतीत होता है। कि मत्स्यपुराणोक्त वास्तुशास्त्रोपदेष्टाओं की नामावली की अपेक्षा “अग्नि पुराण” तथा “मानसार&amp;quot; की सूचियाँ भ्रष्ट और काल्पनिक हैं जिनमें पुनरुक्ति दोष भी है। इन सूचियों के आचार्यों में कुछ ज्ञान-विज्ञान के देवता, कुछ वैदिक या पौराणिक ऋषि, कुछ असुर और कुछ सामान्य शिल्पज्ञ आचार्य हैं।&#xA;वास्तुविद्या&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not as easy to dispose of &lt;em&gt;Mysing&lt;/em&gt;, as the specialists pretend, e.g., by preferring to interpret his name as &amp;ldquo;mouse-gray&amp;rdquo; instead of the equally possible &amp;ldquo;son of a mouse.&amp;rdquo; Olrik (pp. 459f.) proposes to identify straightaway &amp;ldquo;King Mysing who killed Frith-Frothi, and the cow that struck down Frothi the Peaceful . . . King Mysing is merely a rationalistic explanation of the ancient monster.&amp;rdquo; (For the death of Frodi by means of a sea cow, see also P. Herrmann&amp;rsquo;s commentary on Saxo, pp. 380-84. This &amp;ldquo;cow&amp;rdquo; — in Iceland they remain within the frame of zoology and make it a stag — was, according to Saxo, a witch, who was pierced through by Frodi&amp;rsquo;s men. Afterwards they kept Frodi&amp;rsquo;s death a secret for three years, in the same manner as told by Snorri in his &lt;em&gt;Heimskringla&lt;/em&gt; about Frey.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ambiguity-in-calendar-dates&#34;&gt;Ambiguity in calendar dates&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though the Flux of Time is a continuous process, it is divided for the sake of convenience and for natural reasons too, into years, months and days. The years are mostly counted from the beginning of an era, so that if we wish to date a memorable event, say the birth day of George Washington, it can be seen from an inspection of his birth register that it took place on Feb.11, of the year 1732. But this practice by itself does not enable a scientific chronologist to fix up the event unambiguously on the absolute Scale of Time, unless the whole history of the particular method of date-recording is completely and accurately known. One must know the lengths of the individual months, the leap-year rules, and the history of calendar reform. In the particular case mentioned, though George Washington. according to his birth register is stated to have been &lt;strong&gt;born on Feb. 11, 1732, his birth-day is celebrated on Feb. 22&lt;/strong&gt;. Why? Because Feb. 11 was the date according to the Julian calendar. But in 1752, England (America was then a colony of England) adopted the reformed Gregorian calendar, and by an Act of Parliament, declared Sept. 3 to be Sept.14, a difference of 11. days. Following the Gregorian calendar, Washington&amp;rsquo;s birth-day had to be shifted to Feb. 22. A scientific chronologist, say of China, would find it &lt;strong&gt;difficult to locate Washington&amp;rsquo;s birth-day unless he knew the whole history of the Gregorian calendar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Jumbled 2 column text needs to be fixed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rise of Siddhāntas or Scientific Astronomy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendarical rules appear, from inscriptional records, to have been used right up to the end of the reign of the śātavāhanas (200 A.D.). The analysis of inscriptional data on methods of date recording given in § 5.5 shows that it was the śaka and Kuṣāṇa rulers (50 B.C. - 100 A.D.), who introduced the Graeco-Chaldean methods of date-recording, prevalent in&amp;rsquo; the Near East into India. These methods require a knowledge of the fundamentals of astronomy, which must have been available to the śaka and Kuṣāna rulers. In India, as &amp;rsquo;the inscriptional records show, some purely Indian dynasts probably accepted the system in full from about 248 A.D. (date of foundation of the Kalachuri era, the earliest era founded by Indian kings, leaving aside the śaka era which is admittedly of foreign origin and the Vikrama era whose origin is still - shrouded in mystery). During the time of the Guptas who founded an era commemorating their accession to power in 319 A.D. the integration of the western system with the Indian appears to have been complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Julian year of 365.25 days was longer than the true year of 365.2422 by .0078 days, so the winter solstice day which fell on December 21 in 323 A.D., fell back by 10 days in 1582 A.D. and the Christmas day appeared to be losing all connections with the winter solstice. Similar discrepancy was also noticed in connection with the observance of the Easter.*&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Easter&lt;/strong&gt;, the most joyous of the Christian festivals, is observed annually throughout Christendom in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, on the &lt;strong&gt;first Sunday after the full-moon&lt;/strong&gt; following the vernal equinox day. The last days of Christ coincided with the Passover fast of the Jews and his death fell upon the day of the feast of the Passover, on the 14th day of the month of Nisan. As the date of Easter is associated with the moon&amp;rsquo;s phases, as well as the vernal equinox day, it is a movable festival, falling anywhere between March 22 and April 25. A movement is going on for narrowing down the range of variation of the Easter day ; in 1928 the British Parliament passed the Easter Act, which contingent upon its acceptance internationally, fixed Easter day as the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April, falling between April 9 and 15. (Vide Encyclopaedia Britannica, Easter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ancient Jewish calendar was lunar, the beginning of the month being determined by the first visibility of the lunar crescent. As the month-names show (col. 4 of the table No. 4.), they were evidently derived from the &lt;strong&gt;Babylonian month-names&lt;/strong&gt; excepting one or two, viz., Marheshvan and Tammuz. The &lt;strong&gt;day began in the evening&lt;/strong&gt; and probably at sunset. The year used to begin with the &lt;strong&gt;spring month Abib or Nisan&lt;/strong&gt;, the latter being the Babylonian name of the month which was adopted by the Jews in the post-exilic times. &lt;strong&gt;Intercalation&lt;/strong&gt; was performed, when necessary, repeating the twelfth month &amp;lsquo;Adar&amp;rsquo; which was then known as Veadar followed by Adar. The year beginning was subsequently changed and in the last century before Christ, it became the month of Tishri, corresponding to the Macedonian month of Dios. This must have been due to the desire or need to follow the practice of the ruling race.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Let us now examine if there is any reliable evidence to show that the Vedic priests made any corrections in the calendar when by the precession of the equinoxes the cycle of seasons gradually fell back. All our present calendars are prepared on the supposition that the vernal equinox still coincides with the end of Revati and our equmeration of the Nakshatras begins with Ashvini, though the equinox has now receded about 18° from Revatī. It has been shown by Prof. Whitney (Sūrya Siddhānta, viii., 9 note, p. 311) that the above position of the vernal equinox may be assumed to be true at about 490 A. D. Taking this as the probable date of the introduction of the present system, we have now to see if we can trace back the position of the vernal equinox amongst the fixed circle of stars. The question, so far, as one antecedent stage is concerned, has been thoroughly discussed by Colebrooke, Bentley, Max Mūller, Weber, Whitney, Biot, and other scholars : and I shall therefore only summarise what they have said, noting the points where I differ from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early astronomers must have found that the sun&amp;rsquo;s path in the heavens was almost fixed, while that of the moon, and of the planets, which acquired for astrological reasons great importance from about 1200 B.C., strayed some degrees to the north and south of the ecliptic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case of the moon the deviation from the ecliptic was found to be not much greater than 5°, but some of the planets strayed much more ; in the case of Venus, her perpendicular distance from the ecliptic rises sometimes as high as 80 degrees. So a belt was imagined straying about 9° north and go south of the ecliptic, in which the planets would always remain in course of their movement. This belt came to be known as the &amp;lsquo;Zodiac.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their opinions run along these lines: &amp;ldquo;The last part of the story of Grotti and Mysing is &amp;lsquo;How the sea grew salt.&amp;rsquo; This is a different motif, in no wise connected with the peace of Frothi.&amp;rdquo; [1]  Genzmer&amp;rsquo;s wording is more arrogant still. The transportation of the mill by Mysing and the grinding of salt aboard the ship is &amp;ldquo;die Anschweissung einer zweiten selbständigen Sage; der grossartig einfache, ahnungsvolle Schluss unserer Dichtung wird durch ein solches Anhängsel tödlich geschädigt.&amp;rdquo; [2]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fhālgunt full-moon, the new year&amp;rsquo;s night-Sāyaṇa&amp;rsquo;s explanation un.&#xA;satisfactory&amp;ndash;Phālguna could not be a Vasaota month-Two lold character of the seasons, lunar and solar, superfluous-Discus. sion of a passage in bhushruta-Bhāskara Bhaṭṭa&amp;rsquo;s explanation.

The words used in the original are Chilra-purna-masa and Phalguni pūrna masa and these must be understood to denote, not the Chaitra and the Phālguna mooths, whether sidereal and synodical, as Prof. Weber seems to have, in one case, sup posed, but the full moon days in each of these munths. This is evident from the fact that these have been recom. mended as alternative times for the commencement of the satra in opposition to the Ekashtaka day. In the case of the Phaiguni.purna-masa we are further told that Viṣūvān&#xA;counted from that time falls during the rainy season, and it is impossible to suppose that Viṣūvan can be counted from a mouth. The whole context, therefore, shows that it is a discussion as to the particular day best suited to commence the yearly sacrifice, and that Chitrd.pūrn a-misia and Phal. guni-pūrna masa must mean the days when the moon is full near the asterisms of Chitra and Phalgupi. In the Tāndya Brāhmaṇa* Phalguni-purna.māsa is rendered by Phalguni and Jaimini has paraphrased Chritā piirna-masa by Chaitri and Phalguni and Chaitri, according to Piṇini (iv. 2. 3), are the names of days. These interpretations have been accept ed by all the Mimānsakas including Sāyaṇa, and we may do the same especially as there are several passages in the Taittirīya saṁhitā where piirna-māsa is used in a similar sense.t&#xA;But why should the Chitrā and the Phalgunī full-moon be called the beginnings of the year? Sāyaṇa thinks that they were so described because they occurred during Vasanta or the first of the seasons. I But the explanation does not appear satisfactory. I have previously shown that according to all astronomical works Shishira commenced with the winter solstice, and that the three seasons of Shi&#xA;* See the passages quoted in the last chapter,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sun-and-moon-observation&#34;&gt;Sun and moon observation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have seen that it was the needs of the calendar which gave rise to scientific astronomy which in the earliest times covered :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(a) Systematic observation of the movements of the moon, and the sun,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(b) Recording of the observations in some convenient form on permanent materials,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(c) Invention of mathematical methods to deal with the observations, with a view to predict astronomical events.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not, however, correct to say that it was the calendar based on the sun and the moon which provided the sole stimulus for astronomical studies. At one time, the planets strongly captured the attention of man (A. i Anekoek: The Origin of Astronomy, p. 351).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mohammedan calendar is &lt;strong&gt;purely lunar&lt;/strong&gt; and has no connection with the solar year. The year consists of 12 lunar months, the beginning of each month being determined by the first observation of the crescent moon in the evening sky. The months have accordingly got 29 or 30 days and the &lt;strong&gt;year 354 or 355 days&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;new-year day&lt;/strong&gt; of the Mohammedan calendar thus retrogrades through the seasons and &lt;strong&gt;completes the cycle in a period of about 324 solar years&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Jumbled 2 column text needs to be fixed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Justification of the Solar Calendar as proposed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;by the Committee It has been shown that the intention of the maker of Sarya Siddhānta and of other Siddhāntas was to start the year from the moment of sun&amp;rsquo;s crossing the vernal equinoctial point and to start the civil year from the day following. The Committee has also adopted this view and proposed that the civil year for all-India use should start from the day following the V. E. day, i.e., from March 22. In the Vedic literature also it is found that the starting of the year was related with one or other of the cardinal days of the year. The Vedānga Jyōtiṣa started the year from the winter solstice day, the Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian spring (Vasanta) when the tropical (Sayana) longitude of the sun amounted to 330°, but in the Siddhāntic period the year-beginning coincided with the V. E. day. So in adopting the Sāyana system in our calendar calculations, the Indian tradition, from the Vedic times up to the Siddhāntic times, has been very faithfully observed. This has ensured that the Indian seasons would occupy permanent places in the calendar. .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;drawbacks-of-gregorian-calendar&#34;&gt;Drawbacks of Gregorian calendar&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As already stated the Gregorian calendar is a most inconvenient system of time-reckoning. The &lt;strong&gt;days of the months vary&lt;/strong&gt; from 28 to 31 ; quarters consist of 90 to 92 days; and the two half years contain 181 and 184 days. The &lt;strong&gt;week-days wander about&lt;/strong&gt; the month from year to year, so the year and month beginnings may fall on any week-day, and this causes serious inconvenience to civic and economic activities. The &lt;strong&gt;number of working days per month varies&lt;/strong&gt; from 24 to 27, which creates considerable confusion and uncertainty in economic dealings and in the preparation and analysis of statistics and accounts. The present Gregorian calendar is therefore in dire need of reform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Saba, Chairman&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Member&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shri J.

According to his suggestion it was decided that &lt;strong&gt;Yoga&lt;/strong&gt; should be given in the Experimental Calendar, but Karana need not be given. Instead of 27 Yogas only &lt;strong&gt;Vyatipāta and Vaidhr̥ti&lt;/strong&gt; calculated with tropical longitudes of the Sun and the Moon should be given.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been considered neccessary to give a short account of Greek contributions to astronomy, because there is a widespread view that it was Greek astronomy which formed the basis of calendar reform in India which took place about 400 A.D. ( Siddhānta Jyotiṣa calendar). Let us see how far this view is correct. The Greeks themselves appear to have made no use of astronomy for the reform of their own calendars, as was done later in India. They cultivated astronomy partly as pure science, partly as an indispensable adjunct to astrology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever we wish to define a date precisely we have to mention the year, generally current of an era, besides the month and the particular day of the month, and the week-day. This enables an astronomer, well-versed in technical chronology, to place the event! correctly on the time-scale. In international practice the Christian era is used, which is supposed to have started from the birth-year of Jesus Christ. But as mentioned in Chapter II, it is an extrapolated era which came in use five hundred years after the birth of the Founder of Christianity, and its day of starting may be widely different from the actual birthday of Christ, about which there exists no precise knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was the contest of Vainamoinen with Youkahainen (see p. 97), a malevolent Lapp magician who seems to, be his constant opponent. Youkahainen tries to overcome the ancient sage by asking cosmogonic riddles, but Vainamoinen &amp;ldquo;sings&amp;rdquo; the Lapp step by step into the bog up to his throat, and sings his magic formulae &amp;ldquo;backwards&amp;rdquo; to free him only when the Lapp has promised him Aino, his only sister. There was also the tale of Vainamoinen searching in the dead giant&amp;rsquo;s belly for three lost runes. These, unless they are treated as &amp;ldquo;just so stories,&amp;rdquo; look very much like &amp;ldquo;erratic boulders&amp;rdquo; deposited in Finland by the glacial movement of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even a casual observer on a clear night is sure to be attracted by its splendid appearance, and the rising of the sun in this portion of the heavens at the beginning the year must have rendered it doubly attractive to the ancient Aryan observers. It contains no less than five stars of the first magnitude including Sirius and a number of the second, with the stream of the Milky Way passing through them. Here there was a fine field for the virgin imagigation of the ancient poets and&#xA;V.]&#xA;THE ANTELOPE&amp;rsquo;S HEAD. 97 priests and the numerous legends that exist in almost all the sections of the Aryan race about this portion of the heavens fully show that they did not fail to make use of this brilliant opportunity. I intend to examine some of these legends in this chapter with a view to see what corroborative evidence we may get therefrom. If we can more naturally and easily explain the legends that relate to this part of the heavens on the present theory, than has hitherto been done, we may fairly conclude that we have rightly interpreted the passages - from the Brāhmaṇas; if not, we shall have either to revise our assumption or lo give it up entirely. But before we do so we must, as far as possible, try to identify the asterisms and determine their forms as described in the ancient works.&#xA;We shall first take up Mr̥gaśiras or Agrahayani according to Amarasinha. The very name of the Nakṣatra, which means &amp;ldquo;an antelope&amp;rsquo;s head,&amp;rdquo; • suggests the figure of the asterism But the constellation consists of so many stars that it is very difficult to say which of ihem might have suggested the name. I may here remark that the doctrine of &amp;quot; Yogatārās” or the junction stars cannot be supposed to have been developed in the early days we are here&#xA;* I may here, once for all remark that though I have translated the word Mr̥gaśiras by the &amp;ldquo;antelope&amp;rsquo;s head,&amp;rdquo; I do not mean to imply that Mriya necessarily meant &amp;ldquo;an antelope&amp;rdquo; in the Vedic literature. It has been suggested that Mriga may mean &amp;ldquo;a bullock &amp;quot; or some other animal like it. It may, but we have nothing to do with it, inasmucb as the word Mriga itself is still used in the Sanskrit literature to denote the constellation. My translation of Mr̥gaśiras must therefore be considered provisional, remembering that tbough it may change yet the argument in this chapter will still remaiu unaltered.&#xA;speaking of. I do not mean to say that single stars may not have been or were not specifically named. But whereever a constellation is spoken of, it is more probable that the whole group was intended, as in the case of the Seven Bears or the Krittikas; and hence the determination of the junction stars, as given in later astronomical works, cannot help us beyond indicating where we are to look for the constellation described in the old works. For instance, if we take Irigashiras we are told that one of he three small stars in the head of Orion is the junction star. This means that we must look for Mr̥gaśiras in the constellation of Orion. But how can these three stars give us the figure of an antelope&amp;rsquo;s head? The three stars are so close that between them. selves they give us no figure at all. It is, however, suggested that the (wo stars in the shoulders and two in the knees of Orion give us the four feet of the antelope, whose head may then be said to correspond with the three stars in the Orion&amp;rsquo;s head. lo short it is the antelope&amp;rsquo;s head in the same way as it is the head of Orion, But besides being open to the objection da: this gives us the head and not the form of an antelope&amp;rsquo;s head, the explanation presupposes that the whole of the antelope is in the heavens; and if ārdrā be correctly identified with the star in the right shoulder of Orion we shall have also to include this star in the four feet of the antelope. The old Vedic works, however, seem to lay down that it was the head of the antelope and not the antelope itself, that was transplanted to the heavens. Referring to the legend of Rudra piercing Prajāpati, Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Shalapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 1. 2. 8) * observes that he, the&#xA;*पुणा तस्य शिरविण्छेद&amp;quot;&amp;ldquo;इषुः शिरवेत्युभयमंतरिक्षमुरप्लुत्व नक्षत्रात्मना afin ta I Sāyaṇa&amp;rsquo;s commentary on Shat, &amp;lsquo;3r. ii. 1. 2. 8.&#xA;V.]&#xA;THE ANTELOPE&amp;rsquo;S HEAD.&#xA;99&#xA;terrible form created by the gods, &amp;ldquo;cut off Prajāpati&amp;rsquo;s head by the arrow,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;quot; the arrow and the head both jumped up to the heavens and are there stationed.&amp;rdquo; The Aitareya&#xA;Brāhmaṇa (iii. 33) gives the same story and there loo Pashu man or Bhutavan is said to have pierced Prajāpati with an arrow. But it does not distinctly say whether it was the head or the body that was pierced by him though in the śatapatha Brahmaña Mr̥gaśiras is described as the head of Prajā pati. The tradition of piercing the head does not, however, occur in this form in the R̥gveda, though in Rig. x. 61. 5.7 this story of Prajāpati is alluded to. But in many places where lodra is mentioned as killing Vr̥itra we are told that he cut off the head of his enemy (i. 02. 10; iv. :8. 9; viii. 6. 7) and in Rig. v. 34.% and viii. 93. 14, Indra&amp;rsquo;s enemy is described as appearing in the form of an antelope. This shows that the R̥gveda indirectly speaks of an antelope&amp;rsquo;s head having been cut off by Indra, and it may justify us in holdiug that Rudra did the same. The tradition is preserved even in the Greek mythology which tells us that Apollo, indignant at her sister&amp;rsquo;s affections for Orion, made her hit, with an arrow, a mark in the distant sea, which turned out to be the Orion&amp;rsquo;s head. In the heavens we must therefore look for the &amp;ldquo;cut off&amp;rdquo; head of Mpiga with the arrow pierced in it. There are other circumstances which point to the conclusion. Sanskrit writers have described a small group of stars in Mr̥gaśiras called lovakās. Amarasinha tells us thal they are &amp;ldquo;on che top of Mr̥gaśiras. Now if Mr̥gaśiras&#xA;* See Smith&amp;rsquo;s Dictionary of Classical Mythology. Ov. Fast, v,537.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. देवी प्रसाद त्रिपाठी&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;विभिन्न आकाशीय सूचनाओं से युक्त विस्तृत तिथि पत्र एवं कालदर्शक को पञ्चाङ्ग कहा जाता है। इसमें तिथि, वार नक्षत्र योग और करण ये पाँच प्रमुख अंग होते है। इन्हीं पाँच अंगों के कारण इसे &amp;lsquo;पञ्चाङ्ग&amp;rsquo; कहा भी जाता है। तिथि नक्षत्र आदि का साधन चन्द्रमा और सूर्य के योगांशों से किया जाता है। इसलिए भारतीय पञ्चांगों को चान्द्र-सौर पञ्चांग भी कहा जाता है अमान्त को आकाश में चन्द्र एवं सूर्य का क्रान्तिवृत्तीय आभासिक पूर्वापरान्तराभाव होता है। उसके पश्चात् सामान्यतया अपनी अधिक गति के कारण चन्द्र, सूर्य से आगे जाता हुआ प्रतीत होता है। जब चन्द्र एवं सूर्य के मध्य १२° का अन्तर होता है तब एक तिथि की पूर्ति होती है। इसलिए एक चान्द्रमास में (३६०° भ्रमण करने में) ३० तिथियां होती हैं। वार का मान एक सूर्योदय से दूसरे सूर्योदय पर्यन्त होता है। नक्षत्रमण्डल अथवा क्रान्तिवृत्त को आठ सौ कलाओं से विभक्त करने पर २७ समान भाग होते हैं। प्रत्येक भाग को नक्षत्र और उसे भोगने में चन्द्र को जितना समय लगता है, उसे नक्षत्र मान कहते हैं। सूर्य एवं चन्द्र के भोगांशों को जोड़ने से योग नामक अंग का साधन होता है। सूर्य एवं चन्द्र की गति को योग ८०० कला होने में जितना समय लगता है उसे योग मान कहते हैं। इनकी संख्या २७ होती है। &amp;lsquo;करण&amp;rsquo; नामक अंग तिथि का आधा माना गया है। कह सकते हैं कि सूर्य एवं चन्द्र में ६ अंश का अंतर जितने समय में पड़ता है उसे करण कहते हैं। वस्तुतः करण का अलग से साधन नहीं किया जाता है अपितु तिथिकाल के आधे को करणकाल कहा जाता है। उपर्युक्त पांच अंगों के अतिरिक्त सम्प्रति पञ्चाङ्ग पत्रकों में दैनिक व्यवहारोपयोगी दिनमान, ग्रहों के उदयास्त, ग्रहण विवरण, दैननन्दिन स्पष्ट ग्रह, दिनांक आदि सामग्रियां भी दी जाती हैं।&#xA;भारतीय पञ्चाङ्ग पद्धति निरयण चान्द्र सौरात्मक हैं। वर्ष प्रमाण निरयण सौरवर्ष के अनुसार तथा मास चान्द्रमान के अनुसार दिये जाते हैं किन्तु सौर एवं चान्द्र वर्षों में प्रायः ११ दिन का अन्तर प्रत्येक वर्ष परिलक्षित होता है। इसलिए लगभग प्रति तृतीय वर्ष (३२ मास १६ दिन ४ घटी पर) एक अधिमास प्रक्षेपण का आविष्कार हमारे चिन्तकों ने किया है, जिसके कारण ऋतुओं एवं मासों में सामंजस्य बना रहता हैं। इस प्रकार भारतीय पञ्चाङ्ग पद्धति में सौर चान्द्रमासों का संतुलन स्वयमेव होता रहता हैं।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Jumbled 2 column text needs to be fixed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have seasons because the celestial equator is oblique The amount of daylight received at any place determines to the sun&amp;rsquo;s path (or the ecliptic), or in modern parlanoo, the season. When we have maximum sunlight, we have the axis of rotation of the earth is not perpendioular to its the bot season. When we have minimum sunlight, we shall orbit, but inclined at an angle of 661. This causes varying have winter. The other seasons come in-between. Bain, amounts of sunlight to fall on a particular locality through frost, etc., are secondary effects produced by varying out the year. If the earth&amp;rsquo;s axis were perpendicular to the amounts of sunlight, and of the atmospherio conditions ecliptic, in other words the obliquity were zero, overy stimulated by the sunlight received. The sun is the sole portion of the earth from the equator to the pole would Srbiter of the seasons. have had 12 hours of sunlight, and- 12 hours of shade. Hence the definitions of seasons as given by the ancient There would have been no seasons on any part of the earth, astronomers, whether Western and Indian, which base them just as we have now for places on the earth&amp;rsquo;s equator, whore on the cardinal days of the year, are the only correct, we have no variation of geason throughout the year, because definitions. A system which deviates from this practice is the day and night are equal for all days of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous sections, we have stated how the Chaldean and Greek astronomers started giving&#xA;positions of planets, and stars, with the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator—the first point of Aries-as the fiducial point. We shall now relate how the discovery was made that this point is not fixed in the heavens, but has a slow motion along the ecliptic to the west at the rate of ca. 50&amp;quot; per year. The rate is very small, but as it is unidirectional and cumulative, it is of immense importance to astronomy, and incidentally is very damaging to astrology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the present chapter I mean to examine other legends which go to shew that the constellation of Orion was known and figured before the Greeks, the Parsis, and the Indians separated from their common home, and that the legends or the traditions so preserved, and perhaps the name of the constellation, can be naturally and easily explained only on the supposition that the vernal equinox was then near the asterism of Mr̥gaśiras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It will be made clear that well known “Hindu new year” celebrated in sidereal &lt;em&gt;Chaitra Shukla&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;pratipada&lt;/em&gt; is neither the beginning of the true Vedic year nor the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Vasanta Ritu&lt;/em&gt;, according to Vedic astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And the wife conceived a hatred to him, and she was flying from him through woods and wilderness; and he continued to follow her constantly. And one day that the woman came to the sea shore of Camas . . . she met a skeleton of a whale on the strand, and she heard the sounds of the wind passing through the sinews of the whale on the strand, and she fell asleep from the sounds. And her husband came after her; and he perceived that it was from the sounds the sleep fell upon her. And he then went forward into the wood, and made the form of a &lt;em&gt;Cruit;&lt;/em&gt; [1]  and he put strings from the sinews of the whale into it; and that was the first Cruit that was ever made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The italics are ours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is only the careless manner in which we usually deal with precise terms that blocks the understanding: e.g., Greek &lt;em&gt;moira&lt;/em&gt;, also written moros, is translated as &amp;ldquo;fate&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;destiny,&amp;rdquo; sometimes as &amp;ldquo;doom&amp;rdquo;; moira is one degree of the 360° of the circle; when we keep this in mind we understand better such lines as Odd.&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.34-35, where Aegisthus is accused twice of having done deeds &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;hyper moron&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; beyond degree. How could one overstep one&amp;rsquo;s destiny? How could one be over-measured against fate? This would invalidate the very concept of &amp;ldquo;destiny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The real problem before us is to &lt;strong&gt;stop the moving back of the seasons&lt;/strong&gt; through the months Caitra, Vaiśākha etc., in such a manner that will fit in with the present Dharmaśāstra. We can only give a new interpretation or meaning to the words Caitra, Vaisākha etc., and Aśvini, bharaṇī etc., used in the Dharmaśāstras. From this stand point our resolutions in our first meeting still stand unimpeached. I shall now explain what I say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The statement, however, is too general and vague to be criticised and examined. If it is intended to be understood in the sense that the complex machinery of observation which the modern astronomers possess and the results which they have obtained thereby were unknown in early days, then I think there cannot be two opinions on that point. But if by it is meant that the Vedic poets were ignorant of everything except the sun and the dawn, ignorant of the Nakṣatras, ignorant of month, ayanas, years and so on, then there is no authority or support for such a supposition in the R̥gveda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER X — The Twilight of the Gods&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THERE WAS ONCE, then, a Golden Age. Why, how, did it come to an end? This has been a deep concern of mankind over time, refracted in a hundred myths, explained in so many ways which always expressed sorrow, nostalgia, despondency. Why did man lose the Garden of Eden? The answer has always been, because of some original sin. But the idea that man alone was able to commit sin, that Adam and Eve are the guilty ones, is not very old. The authors of the Old Testament had developed a certain conceit. Christianity then had to come to rescue and restore cosmic proportions, by insisting that God alone could offer himself in atonement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. रविशङ्कर भार्गव&#xA;समस्त ज्योतिष शास्त्र, प्रत्यक्ष शास्त्र है, जिसके प्रत्यक्ष प्रमाण स्वरूप आकाश में सूर्य एवं चन्द्रमा हैं। अतः आकाशीय ग्रहपिण्डों की यथार्थ स्थिति का ज्ञान जिस गणितीय विधा से होता है उसे &amp;lsquo;खगोल शास्त्र&amp;rsquo; के रूप में जाना जाता है। खगोल में अनुमानादि प्रमाणों द्वारा सिद्धियाँ नहीं होतीं। खगोल में सभी प्रकार की गणनायें उनके वृत्तीय नियामक स्थानों के अनुसार ही होती हैं। गणना द्वारा ग्रहों का निश्चित मान वेध यंत्र पर यथावत दिख जाने के बाद ही वह वेध-सिद्ध ग्रह कहलाता है, यही दृग्पक्ष या दृग्गणित कहलाता है।&#xA;सभी सिद्धान्तग्रन्थों के अनुसार गणितागत ग्रह भूकेन्द्रीय होते हैं, इसे भूपृष्ठीय प्राप्त करने या लाने के लिये दृक्कर्म की आवश्यकता होती है, यही दृक्कर्म संस्कारयुक्त ग्रह ही दृक्पक्षीय ग्रह कहलाता है। दृक्कर्म क्या है? इसे समझने के लिये खगोलीय स्थिति का जानना आवश्यक होगा।&#xA;__ सर्वप्रथम शर का ज्ञान आवश्यक है। कोई भी ग्रह अपने कदम्बाभिमुख शर के कारण क्रान्तिवृत्त से उत्तर या दक्षिण उन्नत या नत रहता है, तथा ग्रह की क्रान्ति ध्रुव प्रोतवृत्त में नाड़ी वृत्त और क्रान्तिवृत्त का इष्ट स्थान में अन्तर रूप होती है; परन्तु ग्रह जब अपने शराग्र में है, उस समय यह अन्तर उसकी वास्तविक क्रान्ति नहीं होगी। इसलिये इस शर रूप अन्तर का उक्त दोनों वृत्तों के अन्तर रूप क्रान्ति में संस्कार करना आवश्यक हो जाता है, किन्तु शर कदम्बाभिमुख होता है, और क्रान्ति धुवाभिमुख। अतः दोनों में विजातीयता होने से उक्त कदम्बभिमुख शर को धन या ऋण नहीं किया जा सकता। इसलिये कदम्ब वृत्तगत शर का ध्रुवप्रोत वृत्त में परिणामित करते हैं। यही कारण है कि कदम्बवृत्तीय शर को मध्यम शर तथा ध्रुवप्रोत वृत्तीय शर को स्पष्ट शर की संज्ञा दी जाती है।&#xA;_वस्तुतः क्रान्तिवृत्तीय ग्रहस्थान जिस समय क्षितिज में लगता है, उस समय वह ग्रह पिण्ड क्षितिज पर नहीं लगता, क्योंकि ग्रह अपने शर के कारण क्षितिज से कभी ऊपर तथा कभी नीचे रहता है। अतः वह ग्रह कितने समय बाद क्षितिज में आयेगा? इसके लिये ग्रह के उदय एवं अस्त में दृक्कर्म की आवश्यकता होती है। दृक्कर्म भी दो प्रकार का होता है, (१) आयन दृक्कर्म (२) आक्ष दृक्कर्म। (१) क्रान्ति वृत्त के झुकाव के कारण ग्रहस्थान&#xA;और ग्रह जो अन्तर होता है उसका ज्ञान आक्ष दृक्कर्म से ज्ञात किया जाता है।&#xA;इनके, साधन के लिये वलन की आवश्यकता होती है। ये आयन और आक्ष-वलन क्षितिज में होते हैं। इनके कारण क्षितिज से ग्रह अपने शर से, सौम्यायन वलन में उत्तर२११&#xA;२१०&#xA;दृग्गणित&#xA;ग्र०बि० = ग्रहबिम्ब। ग्र० = क्रान्ति वृत्त में ग्रह स्थान। गो०सं० = गोल सन्धि वि०शग्र० A चापजात्य में&#xA;चापजात्यात्यल्पत्वात् सरल-जात्य-सदृशत्वात् / श बिग्र = ६०°- Zश ग्र विं&#xA;= (६०°-अयनवलन)&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड शर द्वारा उन्नमन तथा दक्षिण शर द्वारा नमन होता है। याम्यायनवलन में, इससे विपरीत अर्थात उत्तर शर द्वारा नमन तथा दक्षिण शर द्वारा उन्नमन होता है। यह स्थिति पूर्वक्षितिज की है, इससे विपरीत स्थिति पश्चिम क्षितिज की होती है। अर्थात् सौम्यायन वलन में अपने उत्तर शर से ग्रह नामित और दक्षिण शर से उन्नमित होता है, इसी प्रकार याम्यायन वलन में उत्तर शर से उन्नमित और दक्षिण शर से नमित होता है। ग्रह की यह स्थिति निरक्ष देश में होती है, साक्ष देश में स्थिति निम्न प्रकार से होती है&#xA;पूर्वक्षितिज में सौम्य आक्षवलन में उत्तर शर से ग्रह उन्नमित और दक्षिण शर से नमित होता है, तथा पश्चिम क्षितिज में, इससे भिन्न उत्तर शर से ग्रह नमित तथा दक्षिण शर से ग्रह उन्नमित होता है। इसी प्रकार याम्याक्षवलन में, पूर्वक्षितिज में ग्रह उत्तरशर से नमित तथा दक्षिण शर से उन्नमित होता है एवं पश्चिम क्षितिज में उत्तर शर से उन्नमित तथा दक्षिण शर से नमित होता है। इस प्रकार ग्रहों के उन्नमन तथा नमन के नियमों को समझना चाहिये।&#xA;यदि त्रिज्या में आयन वलन ज्या मिलती है, तो मध्यम शरज्या में क्या मिलेगा? इस त्रैराशिक से प्राप्त फल आयन कर्म ज्या मिलेगी। इसका चाप आयन दृक्कर्म होगा। इसी प्रकार यदि त्रिज्या में आक्ष वलन ज्या मिलती है तो स्पशर ज्या में क्या मिलेगा? फल आक्ष दृक्कर्म ज्या मिलेगी। इसका फल आक्ष दृक्कर्म प्राप्त होगा। यहाँ आवश्यक है कि इन त्रैराशिकों से जो फल प्राप्त होंगे उनको त्रिज्या से गुणा कर धुज्या से भाग देने पर लब्ध चापांश सम्बंधी फलों के योग अथवा अन्तर से उत्पन्न अस्वात्मक काल में ग्रह क्षितिज से नत अथवा उन्नत होता है।&#xA;अस्तु इस खगोलीय विवेचन का सैद्धान्तिक दृष्टि से उपपादनात्मक विचार निम्न प्रकार से है&#xA;ज्या शविंग्र = ज्या (६०°-अव०)&#xA;= को ज्या अय०व०&#xA;= यष्टिः अथवा यष्टि त्रि-ज्या अव.&#xA;__ = (६०°-अव०)&#xA;= यष्टिः&#xA;ज्या. बिंग x ज्या Zश बिंग्र ज्या शग्र =&#xA;ज्या. बिंशग्र&#xA;मध्यमशर x यष्टि अतः स्प.शद =&#xA;त्रिज्या तथा ज्याबिंश = ज्याविंग्र x ज्या / बिंग्रश&#xA;ज्या बिंशग्र&#xA;ज्या मध्यम शर x ज्या अयनवलन अर्थात् - आयनदृक्क = -&#xA;त्रिज्या&#xA;न्तित&#xA;-MA&#xA;अस्प-TA&#xA;&amp;ndash;342प्रोत हल&#xA;त्रिज्यावर्गादयनवलनज्या कृतिं प्रोड्यमूलं, यष्टिर्यष्ट्या धुचर विशिखस्ताडितस्त्रिज्ययाप्तः। यद्वा राशित्रययुतखगधुज्यकाघ्नस्त्रिमौळ, भक्तः स्पष्टो भवति नियतं क्रान्तिसंस्कारयोग्यः।। (सि०शि०गो० ग्रहच्छा० श्लो० ३.)&#xA;स्पष्टार्थ क्षेत्र देखें क० = कदम्ब ध्रु० = ध्रुव&#xA;२१२&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;२१३&#xA;यायो त&#xA;अतः&#xA;_&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The traditions of each nation taken singly may not be conclusive, but when, putting all these together, and interpreting onc set in the light of another, we find that directly or indirectly all point to the same conclusion, their cumulative effect cannot but be&#xA;CHAPTER VIII.)&#xA;CONCLUSION,&#xA;199&#xA;conclusive. Scholars have already discovered the similarity between the traditions of the three nations, but without any clue to the period when all the Aryas lived together, it was impossible to reduce all these traditions into a harmonious whole. The traditions of Orion, and especially its position at the beginning of the equinoctial year, do, however, supply such a clue, and with its help the mystery about the oldest periods of Aryan civilization is consider ably cleared up. Thus if Orion is now no longer a hunter of unknown parentage, we need not also indulge in uncer tain speculations about the foamy weapon with which Indra killed his enemy, or how the four-eyed dogs came to be stationed at the Chinvat Bridge, or why the r̥bhus are said to be awakened by a dog at the end of the year.&#xA;Astronomically the matter is as simple as it could be. All our measurements of time are directly based upon the changes in the positions of heavenly bodies. But there is no measurement of time, at present determined, which is longer than the period during which the equinoxes complete their revolution in the ecliptic. It is, therefore, the best measurement of time for determining the periods of anti quity, only if we have reliable records about the position of heavenly bodies in early days. Fortunately, such records of the time, when the Hellenic, the Iranian and the Indian Aryans lived tegether, have been preserved for us in the R̥gveda, and with the help of the Greek and Parsi traditions we can now uecipher these records inscribed on the specially cultivated memory of the Indian Aryans. Commencing with the passages in the Taittirīya Sanhits and the Brāhmaṇas, which declare that the Phalguni full. moon was once the new.year&amp;rsquo;s night, we found that Mriga&#xA;shiras was designated by a name which, if rightly inter preted, showed that the vergal equinox coincided with that&#xA;anterium in old times. This was, 80 to speak, a sort of&#xA;· corroborative evidence of the truth of the statement in the&#xA;Taittirīya Sanbita. A reference to the figure will show at a glance that if the sun be at the winter solstice on the Phalguni full moon day, the moon to be full must be diametrically opposite to the sun and also near Phalguni. Uttara Phalgupi will thus be at the summer solstice and the verbal equinox will coincide with Mr̥gaśiras. With the sol stice in Māgha, the equinox will be in the Kr̥ttikās ; while when the Uttarāyaṇa begins in Pausha the equinox is in Ashvini. Ashvint and Pauṣa, Kr̥ttikās and Māgha, and Mr̥gaśiras and Phālguna are thus the correlative pairs of successive year.beginnings depending entirely upon the pre cession of the equinoxes; and the facts, statements, texts and legends discussed in the previous chapters supply us with reliable evidence, direct and indirect, of the existence of all these year.beginnings in the various periods of Aryan civili. zation. It has been further shown that not only the traditions, but also the primitive calendar of the Parsis bears out the conclusions we have deduced from the Vedic works.&#xA;We have so far considered only one of the traditional year beginnings recorded in the Taittirīya Saphita, the Phalguni sull-moon. But it may be asked how we interpret the other mentioned along with it, and almost in the same words. Apalogy al once suggests that we should interpret il in the same way as we have iolerpreted the first. With the Phalguni full-moon, at the winter colstice the verpal equinox was in Mr̥gaśiras; 50 with the Onitra full-moon at the solstice the vergal equinox would be in Punarvasa.&#xA;201&#xA;VIIL)&#xA;CONCLUSION.&#xA;Let us, therefore, see if we have evidence in the Vedic literature in support of such an ia terpretation. It may be observed that we are here entering upon the remotest period of antiquity, when the year was probably first determined with some approach to accuracy; and even in the Vedas there is hardly anything beyond vague traditions about this period, while the Grecks and the Parsis have not, it appears, preserved even these.&#xA;There is no express passage which states that Puaarvasu was ever the first of the Nakṣatras, nor have we in this case a synonym like āgrahāyaṇa, or Orion, wherein we might discover similar traditions. There are, however, some indications about the oldest position of Punarvasū preserved in the sacrificial literature. The presiding deity of Puparyasa is Aditi, and we are told in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa i. 7, and the Taittirīya Saṁhitā vi. 1, 8.1, that Aditi has been blessed with a boon that all sacrifices must commence and end with her. The story begins with the stateaent that the Sacrifice (the mysterious sacrificial personage) went away from the gods. The gods were then unable to perform any further ceremonies, and did not know where it (the sacrifice) had gone to ; and it was Aditi that helped them, in this state, to find oul the proper commencement of the sacrifices. This clearly means, if it can mean anything, that before this time sacrifices were performed at random, but it was at this time resolved and fixed to commence them from Aditi. Aditi was thus the oldest and the first commencement of the sacrifice or the year. Io the Vājasaneyi saṁhitā 4. 19 Aditi is said to&#xA;• Alt. Br, i. 7. A similar tradition about Orion la narrated in Oreak raytholoty, uit is stated tbat having lost his sight he follow. ed a guide to the cast in search of the sun and there, by, exposing ble tace to the rising sua, his sight was restored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. विनय कुमार पाण्डेय&#xA;ज्योतिष शास्त्र में वेध एवं बेधशालाओं का अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण स्थान है। इस कथन में भी अतिशयोक्ति नहीं होगी कि ज्योतिष शास्त्र की आत्मा वेध एवं वेधशालाओं में ही निवास करती है, जिसकी उपेक्षा से इस शास्त्र की स्थिति अकिञ्चित्कर सी हो जाएगी। वेदाङ्गों में ज्योतिष का स्थान नेत्रत्वेन मूर्धा रूप में वर्णित है, जिसका कारण इसकी प्रत्यक्षता भी है। अन्य वेदाङ्ग शास्त्रों में प्रत्यक्ष अनुमानादि प्रमाण द्वारा समस्त तथ्यों का सम्पादन होता हैं, परन्तु यहाँ प्रत्यक्षता का सर्वोत्कर्ष है। इसलिये यहाँ गणितागत तथ्यों का भी प्रत्यक्षीकरण आवश्यक होता है। यद्यपि गणित शास्त्र स्वयं ही प्रमाणभूत हैं, तथापि ज्योतिष जगत में जब तक गणितागत तथ्यों का भी प्रत्यक्षीकरण नहीं होता तब तक उसकी प्रमाणिकता भी स्वीकार्य नहीं होती। अतएव ग्रन्थों में प्रति पद दृग्गणितैक्य का उद्घोष प्राप्त होता है।&#39;&#xA;गणित द्वारा साधित ग्रहनक्षत्रादिकों की स्थिति का खगोल में प्रत्यक्ष अवलोकन ही दृग्गणितैक्य है। गोल स्थिति के अवलोकन मात्र से ही स्पष्ट ग्रह का वेध विनिगमकत्व सिद्ध होता है। यद्यपि ग्रह भगण एवं अहर्गण द्वारा मध्यम ग्रह साधन पूर्वक फल संस्कार से स्पष्ट ग्रह का साधन विहित हैं, परन्तु गणित सिद्ध ग्रह के सत्यासत्य ज्ञान में वेध को छोड़कर अन्य कोई सरणि नहीं हैं। स्पष्ट ग्रहों का साधन नलिकादि यन्त्रों द्वारा करना ही सर्वथा अनुकूल हैं, परन्तु प्रति पल वेध क्रिया की कठिनता के कारण प्राचीन आचार्यों ने आगमोक्त ग्रह भगण द्वारा ग्रहानयन का विधान बनाया हैं। लेकिन साथ ही समय-समय पर उनकी शुद्धि परीक्षण के लिए वेध का भी आदेश दिया है। गणितीय सिद्धान्तों के कालजन्य दोष से अतिक्रमित होने के कारण गणितागत ग्रह के दृसिद्ध न होने की स्थिति में सिद्धान्त एवं ग्रणित जन्य दोष निवारण के लिए वेध द्वारा ही बीजादि संस्कारों की व्यवस्था शास्त्रों में प्राप्त होती हैं। _ब्रह्माण्डस्थ ग्रहनक्षत्रादि पिण्डों के अवलोकन को वेध कहा जाता है। संस्कृत व्याकरण में वेध व्यध् घातु से निष्पन्न होता है। परिभाषा रूप में नग्ननेत्रया शलाका, यष्टि, नलिका, दूरदर्शक इत्यादि यन्त्रों के द्वारा आकाशीय पिण्डों का निरीक्षण ही वेध है। नलिकादि यन्त्रों से ग्रहों के विद्ध होने के कारण ही इस क्रिया का नाम वेध विश्व विश्रुत हैं। दृष्टि एवं यन्त्र भेद से वेध दो प्रकार का होता हैं।&#xA;१. यात्रा विवाहोत्सवजातकादौ, खेटैः स्फुटैरेव फलस्फुटत्वम्। स्यात् प्रोच्यते तेन नभश्चराणां,&#xA;स्फुटक्रिया दुग्गणितैक्यकृद्या ।। सि०शि०-स्व०, श्लोक०-१.&#xA;२२०&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;दृष्टि वेध भी अन्तर्दृष्टि वेध एवं बाहय दृष्टि वेध के भेद से दो प्रकार का होता है। यहाँ महार्षियों द्वारा यम-नियम-आसन-प्राणायामादि तपस्याओं से भक्ति ज्ञानजन्य नेत्र द्वारा ब्रह्माण्डस्थ पिण्डों के अवलोकन को अन्तर्दृष्टि वेध तथा स्व-स्व नग्न नेत्र द्वारा खस्थ पिण्डावलोकन को बाह्य दृष्टि वेध माना जाता है। जब हम चक्र, नलिका, शङ्कु, दूरदर्शक&#xA;आदि वेध उपकरणों से सूर्यादि ज्योतिष पिण्डों को देखते है तो यन्त्र वेध होता है।&#xA;ब्रह्माण्ड की अनन्त रमणीय सत्ता तक मानव भले ही न पहुँच पाये परन्तु उसका नाचिकेत भाव ब्रह्माण्ड के ग्रह-नक्षत्रादि पिण्डों के बारे में जानने के लिए सदा ही उद्यत रहा है। सृष्ट्यारम्भ काल से ही गगनस्थ पिण्डों की गति स्थिति इत्यादि से चमत्कृत मनुष्यों ने सतत अन्वेक्षण पूर्वक वेध प्रक्रिया विकसित की &amp;ldquo;प्रयोजनमनदिदश्य मन्दोऽपि न प्रवर्तते&amp;rdquo; सिद्धान्त के अनुसार न केवल आकाशीय चमत्कार अपितु काल ज्ञान की जिज्ञासा ने भी मानवों को आकाश के अन्वेक्षण के लिए वाध्य किया। प्राचीन काल में मनुष्य जंगलों में वास करता था रात्रि काल में वन के हिंसक पशुओं के भय से वृक्षों या गुफाओं में शरण लेकर सूर्योदय या चन्द्रोदय की प्रतीक्षा करता था। इस आत्मरक्षा रूप सूर्योदय की प्रतीक्षा ने भी मानवों को गगनान्वेक्षण में प्रवृत्त किया। वस्तुतः ज्योतिष शास्त्र का उद्भव ही महर्षियों के आश्रमों तपोवनों में आकाश दर्शन परम्परा से ही हुआ होगा, इस कथन में भी मिथ्या प्रतीति नहीं होती। परन्तु यह भी सत्य है कि उस समय विकसित वेधोपकरणों एवं वेधशालाओं का अभाव था। परन्तु कुछ यन्त्र अवश्य ही रहे होंगे, जिनका वर्णन लिखित रुप में प्राप्त नहीं होता। _वैदिक काल से ही नक्षत्रों श्वान-नौका प्रजापति ब्रह्मादि तारापुंजों का सप्तर्षि मण्डल एवं नक्षत्रों की युति अन्तर आदि का वर्णन मिलता हैं, जिनका ज्ञान वेध के बिना सम्भव नहीं था। वेदों में वर्णित आकाशीय घटनाओं का उल्लेख वेध सम्बन्धित कुछ साक्ष्य उपस्थापित करता हैं।&#xA;&amp;lsquo;अथो नक्षत्राणामेषामुपस्थे सोम आहतिः”&#xA;इस प्रसङ्ग में नक्षत्रों के मध्य चन्द्रमा की स्थिति सूचित हैं। ऋग्वेद संहिता के एक प्रसङ्ग में बृहस्पति का पुष्य नक्षत्र के साथ उदय निर्दिष्ट हैं-&amp;lsquo;बृहस्पतिः प्रथमन्जायमानो तिष्यं नक्षत्रमभिसम्बभूव&amp;rsquo; (४।५० ।५) यजुर्वेद में नक्षत्र दर्शन का वर्णन भी प्राप्त होता हैं। वाजसनेयी संहिता के &amp;lsquo;प्रज्ञानाय नक्षत्रदर्शनम्&amp;rsquo; उक्ति से भी स्पष्टतया वेध परिलक्षित होता हैं। शतपथ ब्राह्मण के ‘स एव शुक्रः यो हि चमत्कृतो सर्वाधिकः&amp;rsquo; (४.२.१) के अनुसार सबसे अधिक प्रकाशवान ग्रह शुक्र है। ऐतरेय ब्राह्मण (४०.५) के अनुसार अमावस्या में चन्द्रमा&#xA;वेध एवं वेधशालाओं की परम्परा&#xA;२२१ सूर्य में प्रवेश करता है तथा सूर्य से चन्द्रमा की उत्पत्ति होती है। इस मत के अनुसार &amp;lsquo;दर्शः सूर्येन्दु सङ्गमः&amp;rsquo; का सिद्धान्त ध्वनित होता है जिसका ज्ञान वेध के बिना असम्भव हैं। क्रम बद्ध रूप में आकाश दर्शन की परम्परा से &amp;lsquo;न क्षरतीति नक्षत्रम्&amp;rsquo; गच्छतीति ग्रहः इत्यादि ग्रह नक्षत्रों की व्याकरण शास्त्रीय व्युत्पत्तियां सिद्ध हो पायी हैं। वेदों के समग्रावलोकन से प्राप्त ज्योतिषीय तथ्यों के अवगमन द्वारा सारांश रूप में कह सकते हैं कि वैदिक काल में भी वेध परम्परा अबाघ गति से प्रचलित थी, परन्तु किन स्थलो (वेधशालाओं) पर किस साधनों (यन्त्रों) द्वारा वेध सम्पादित होते थे इस विषय में दृढ़ता पूर्वक कुछ भी कहना बड़ा ही कठिन होगा।&#xA;वैदिक काल के अनन्तर लगघ प्रणीत &amp;lsquo;वेदाङ्ग ज्योतिषम्&amp;rsquo; नामक ग्रन्थ हैं। इस ग्रन्थ में भी स्पष्टतया कहीं भी वेध एवं वेधशालाओं का वर्णन प्राप्त नहीं है, परन्तु उत्तरायण सूर्य के दिन वृद्धि एवं दक्षिणायन के दिन ह्रास प्रसङ्ग में दिन मापक किसी पानीय यन्त्र का संकेत प्राप्त होता है।&amp;rsquo; शङ्कर बाल कृष्ण दीक्षित के अनुसार &amp;lsquo;अथर्वज्योतिष&amp;rsquo; नामक ग्रन्थ में द्वादशाङ्गुल शकु की छाया का वर्णन भी प्राप्त होता है। लेकिन वहाँ भी कालान्तर जन्य दोषों के निवारणार्थ किसी भी विधि का निर्देश नहीं है। शुल्बसूत्रों में यज्ञ सम्पादन के प्रसङ्ग में कुण्ड मण्डपादि साधन के लिए शकु द्वारा दिग् साधन का उल्लेख प्राप्त होता है। कौषीतकी ब्राह्मण में सूर्योदय बिन्दु के चल होने का स्पष्ट वर्णन हैं। महाभारत काल में भी ग्रह-नक्षत्रों की स्थिति का समुचित ज्ञान था। शल्य पर्व में शुक्र एवं मंगल के चन्द्रमा से युति का वर्णन प्राप्त होता है। भीष्म पर्व में तो ग्रहों के युति-अन्तरादि विषयों के अनेक उदाहरण उपलब्ध है। भारतीय ज्योतिष नामक ग्रन्थ में गोरख प्रसाद ने स्वीकार किया है कि ग्रहगणित का सम्यक् ज्ञान अत्रि गोत्रीय लोगों के पास था। इस प्रकार हम देखते हैं कि वैदिक काल वेदाङ्ग काल एवं महाभारत काल में वेधोपयोगी यन्त्रों एवं वेधशालाओं का स्पष्ट वर्णन नहीं मिलता, तथापि तत्कालीन दैवज्ञगण किसी न किसी प्रकार से आकाशीय पिण्डों का निरीक्षण अवश्य ही करते थे जिसके परिणम आज के आधुनिक यन्त्रों द्वारा वेधित परिणामों के भी आसन्न दिखाई देते हैं। यद्यपि पाश्चात्य विद्वानों का आक्षेप है कि वेधं क्रिया से अपरिचित भारतीयों ने ग्रीक देशीय विद्वानों का अनुकरण कर वेध सम्बन्धि ज्ञान प्राप्त किया परन्तु वेद वेदाङ्गादि ग्रन्थों में वर्णित ग्रहों के युति-अन्तरादि सम्बन्धि दृष्टान्त एवं अन्य खगोलीय सूक्ष्म तथ्य पाश्चात्यों के आक्षेप के समुचित उत्तर हैं। सम्भवतः प्राचीन काल में प्रायोगिक एवं व्यवहारिक ज्ञान के लेखन की परम्परा नहीं थी।&#xA;१. धर्मवृद्धिरपां प्रस्थः क्षपाह्रास उदग्गतौ। दक्षिणे तो विपर्यासः षड्मुहूर्त्ययनेन तु।।८।। २. भृगुसूनु धरापुत्रौ शशिजेन समन्वितौ। महाभारत-शल्पपर्त ११/१८. ३. भारतीय ज्योतिष-गोरखप्रसाद, पृष्ठ ३४. ४. भारतीय ज्योतिष-बा.कृ.दी., पृष्ट, १३६&#xA;१. ऋग्वेद-१०/८५/२. २. यजुर्वेद-३०/१०.&#xA;२२२&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;वेध एवं वेधशालाओं की परम्परा&#xA;२२३&#xA;सभी ज्योतिष ज्ञानार्थी गण गुरु आश्रम में वास करते हुए तत सम्बन्धि ज्ञानों का अभ्यास करते थे। अतएव प्राचीन भारतीय ज्योतिष के इतिहास में लिखित रूपेण तेधोपकरणों एवं वेधशालाओं का वर्णन प्राप्त नहीं होता।&#xA;__ &amp;lsquo;सूर्यः पितामहो व्यासो वशिष्ठोऽत्रि&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.इत्यादि ज्योतिष शास्त्र प्रवर्तकों में सूर्य का वर्णन सर्व प्रथम उद्धृत है, अतः सूर्योक्त सूर्यसिद्धान्त ज्योतिष शास्त्र का प्रथम सिद्धान्त ग्रन्थ स्वीकृत है। सूर्य सिद्धान्तोक्त प्रमाण के अनुसार इस ग्रन्थ का अपौरुषेयत्व एवं कृतयुगान्त रचना काल सिद्ध होता है। इसके स्पष्टाधिकार में स्पष्ट वर्णन है कि जिस विधि से ग्रह दृष्टि में उपलब्ध होते हैं, उस क्रिया को कह रहा हूँ।&amp;rsquo; ग्रन्थ के अन्त में गोल, बीज, शङ्कु, कपाल एवं मयूर इत्यादि यन्त्रों का वर्णन मिलता हैं।&#xA;परन्तु वहाँ भी यन्त्रों के निर्णाण एवं प्रयोग की विधि नहीं दी गयी है। फिर वेध विधि विकास पथ में अग्रसरित दिखाई देती है। पौरुषेय ज्योतिषशास्त्रीय सिद्धान्त ग्रन्थों में&#xA;सर्व प्रथम ‘आर्य भट्टीय&amp;rsquo; उपलब्ध हैं। इसकी रचना ३६८ शक में आर्यभट ने किया था। इस ग्रन्थ में कालमापक स्वयंवह यन्त्र की निर्माण एवं प्रयोग विधि निर्दिष्ट है तथा शङ्कु यन्त्र का भी वर्णन मिलता है। इसके बाद मध्ययुगीय परम्परा में वेध की दिशा में क्रमशः सार्थक प्रयास दिखाई देता है। वाराहमिहिर के पञ्चसिद्धान्त में वेध सम्पादन पूर्वक बीज संस्कार भी दिखाई देता है। वराहमिहिर के अनन्तर वेध परम्परा में ब्रह्मगुप्त का महत्वपूर्ण योगदान हैं। इनका जन्म ५२० शकाब्द में हुआ था। ब्रह्मगुप्त महान दैवज्ञ वेधकुशल एवं दृक्सिद्ध ग्रहों के पोषक थे। इन्होंने वेध द्वारा यह अनुभव किया कि प्रचलित विभिन्न सिद्धान्तों के द्वारा दृक् सिद्ध ग्रह प्राप्त नहीं होते। अतः ब्रह्मगुप्त ने स्फुट दृक्सिद्ध ग्रहों के आनयन के लिए &amp;lsquo;ब्राह्मस्फुट सिद्धान्त&amp;rsquo; की रचना की। इस ग्रन्थ में स्पष्ट सङ्केत प्राप्त होता है कि नलिकादि यन्त्रों द्वारा स्पष्टतर बीज का साधन कर उससे संस्कृत ग्रहों द्वारा ही निर्णय एवं आदेश करना चाहिए। स्वयं भी इन्होंने अपने काल के प्रचलित सिद्धान्तों द्वारा साधित ग्रहों की दृक् सिद्धता के लिए वेध द्वारा बीज व्यवस्थित किया हैं। इनके द्वारा प्राप्त वेध परिणामों ने न केवल भारत अपितु अरबदेशों को भी प्रभावित किया। इनके काल की वेध परम्परा अपेक्षा कृत सुदृढ़ दिखाई देती है। इनके ग्रन्थ &amp;lsquo;खण्डखाद्यकरण&amp;rsquo; में अनेक नूतन यन्त्रों का समावेश है। ब्रह्मगप्त के बाद १४४२ शक काल तक वेध परम्परा वद्धि पथ में दिखाई देती है। इस बीच मुञ्जाल, श्रीधराचार्य, श्रीपति, भास्कराचार्य, बल्लालसेन, केशवार्क, महेन्द्रसूरि, मकरन्द, केशव, ज्ञानराज इत्यादि वेध निषुण दैवज्ञों के प्रयास वेध की दिशा में अनन्यतम स्थान रखते हैं। दृसिद्ध ग्रह साधन एवं वेध परम्परा मेकेशवदैवज्ञ तथा&#xA;उनके पुत्र गणेश दैवज्ञ का भी महत्वपूर्ण स्थान है। केशव दैवज्ञ वेध क्रिया में अतीव दक्ष दिखाई देते है। १४१८ शक के लगभग इन्होंने ग्रह कौतुक नामक करण ग्रन्थ की रचना वेधसिद्ध ग्रहों के आधार पर की। ग्रहकौतुक के स्वकृत मिताक्षरा टीका में अपने द्वारा किए गये वेध का जैसा स्पष्ट वर्णन इन्होंने दिया है वैसा अन्यत्र ग्रन्थों में नहीं दिखाई पड़ता। कलान्तर से इनके ग्रन्थ को भी वेध द्वारा स्थूल देखकर इनके पुत्र गणेश दैवज्ञ ने, वेध द्वारा प्राप्त निष्कर्षों से ‘ग्रहलाघव&amp;rsquo; नामक करण ग्रन्थ की रचना की। इसके ग्रह अपने काल में पूर्णतया दृष्ट थे। अपने समय के प्रचलित सिद्धान्तों की समीक्षा करते हुए इन्होंने स्पष्ट लिखा है किस मत के अनुसार कौन ग्रह कितना अन्तरित दिखाई देता है। आज भी घहलानवीय गणित द्वारा अनेक पञ्चाङ्ग प्रकाशित होते हैं परन्तु कालान्तर जन्य प्रभाव से ग्रहलाघवीय ग्रह स्थूल हो चुके हैं। गणेश दैवज्ञ ने कालान्तर में होने वाली अशुद्धि की सम्भानाओं से सावधान करते हुये अपने ग्रन्थ में स्पष्ट आदेश किया है कि कालान्तर जन्य प्रभाव से यदि ग्रहलाधवीय सिद्धान्त भी स्थूल हो जाये तो दैवज्ञों को वेध द्वारा स्पष्ट स्थिति ज्ञान कर इसके सिद्धान्त में परिष्कार कर दृक्सिद्ध ग्रहों का साधन करण चाहिए। इसके बाद लगभग दो शताब्दियों तक ज्योतिष एवं वेध परम्परा का प्रचार प्रसार सामान्य गति से चलता रहा। इसके बीच अनेक विद्धान् हुए जिनमें कमलाकर भट्ट एवं मुनीश्वर आदि प्रमुख हैं। इनके ग्रन्थों में भी वेध सम्बन्धि पूर्वागत परम्परा का ही परिपालन है।&#xA;इस तरह सूर्यसिद्धान्त या आर्यभट के काल से आरम्भ कर लगभग १५ वीं शताब्दी तक मुख्यतया शकुयन्त्र, घटीयन्त्र, नलिका यन्त्र, यष्टियन्त्र, चापयन्त्र, तुरीययन्त्र, फलक यन्त्र, दिगंशयन्त्र, एवं स्वयंवह यन्त्र का ही प्रयोग दिखाई देता है। इस काल के कुछ स्वतन्त्र वेध ग्रन्थ भी उपलब्ध होते हैं, जिनमें यन्त्रों के निर्माण एवं प्रयोग विधि का सुस्पष्ट समावेश है, कुछ गन्थों में तो वर्णित यन्त्रों द्वारा साधित गणितीय तथ्य भी निर्दिष्ट हैं। उनमें से कुछ प्रमुख वेध ग्रन्थों का परिचय निम्न प्रकार हैं&#xA;यन्त्रराज-१२६२ शक में महेन्द्रसूरी द्वारा विरचित यह ग्रन्थ अत्यन्त प्रसिद्ध हैं, इसमें यन्त्रराज नामक यन्त्र के निर्माण एवं प्रयोग विधि का उल्लेख हैं। ग्रन्थारम्भ में वर्णित उद्धरणों द्वारा प्रतीत होता है कि इनके समय में यवनों ने वेध के क्षेत्र में अच्छी उन्नत्ति प्राप्त कर ली थी।&#xA;यन्त्रशिरोमणि- १५३७ शालिवाहन शक में श्री विश्रामपण्डित द्वारा विरचित इस ग्रन्थ में यन्त्रों का वर्णन एवं क्रान्ति तथा धुज्यापिण्डों के साधनार्थ सारणियां दी गई हैं। इनसे पूर्व के ग्रन्थों में पद्मनाभ विराचित नलिकायन्त्राध्याय एवं ध्रुवभ्रमयन्त्र, चक्रधर दैवज्ञ विरचित यन्त्रचिन्तामणि, ग्रहलाघवकार गणेश दैवज्ञ विरचित प्रतोदयन्त्र, पूर्णानन्दसरस्वती&#xA;१. तत्तद्गतिवशान्नित्यं यथा दृकतुल्यतां ग्रहाः प्रयान्ति तत् प्रवक्ष्यामि स्फुटी करणमादरात् ।।१४ २. शकुयष्टिधनुश्चक्रैश्छाया यन्त्रैरनेकधा। गुरूपदेशात् विज्ञेयं कालज्ञानमतन्द्रितैःसू० सि० ज्यौ०, २०। ३. संसाध्य स्पष्टतरं बीजं नलिकादि यन्त्रेभ्यः। तत्संस्कृतग्रहेभ्यः कर्त्तव्यौ निर्णयादेशौ ।।३।।&#xA;१. केतकीग्रहगणितम्, पृष्ट ८&#xA;२२४&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;वेध एवं वेधशालाओं की परम्परा&#xA;२२५ प्रत्यक्षीकरण नहीं होता अर्थात् वेधसिद्ध एवं गणित सिद्ध ग्रहों में अन्तर आता है। अतः इसके निवारण हेतु जयसिंह वेध विधि द्वारा सूक्ष्माति सूक्ष्म नूतन पंचाङ्ग सारणी निर्माण हेतु उद्यत हुए। इस क्रम में सर्व प्रथम इन्होंने पीतलधातु से निर्मित लघु यन्त्रों का निर्माण किया, परन्तु शीघ्र ही अनुभव हुआ कि धातुनिर्मित लघु यन्त्रों से प्राप्त वेध परिणाम त्रुटिपूर्ण हैं। क्यों कि आकार में छोटें होने के कारण उन यन्त्रों में अंकों के सूक्ष्म विभाजन की समस्या, तलपरिवर्तन तथा अनेक बार प्रयोग से यन्त्रों के परस्पर घिस जाने के कारण यन्त्रों द्वारा दीर्घकाल तक सही परिणाम नहीं प्राप्त किए जा सकते। अतः इन समस्याओं के निवारण एवं सूक्ष्म परिणाम प्राप्ति के लिए अरब तथा यूरोप देशीय ज्योतिषियों को आमन्त्रित कर भारतीय दैवज्ञों के समन्वय से भारत में पाँच प्रमुख नगरों दिल्ली, वाराणसी, उज्जैन मथुरा एवं जयपुर में १७२४ ईस्वी से १७३८ ईस्वी के मध्य स्निग्ध श्वेत एवं रक्तवर्णीय पाषाण खण्ड़ों से अनेक वेधशालाओं का निर्माण कर ज्योतिष क्षेत्र को उपकृत किया।&#xA;रचित नलिकाबन्ध, इत्यादि प्रमुख हैं। यद्यपि इस काल में वेध प्रक्रिया विकासित हो चुकी थी नये यन्त्रों का अविष्कार भी प्रचलन में था परन्तु स्थायी वेध शालाओं की चर्चा कहीं भी प्राप्त नहीं होती।&#xA;१५ वीं शताब्दी तक यूरोप एवं अरब देशों में वेध प्रक्रिया बहुत विकसित हो चुकी थी। हिपार्कस, टालमी इत्यादि विद्वान अपनी वेध क्षमता से अनेक नूतन तथ्य उपस्थापित कर लिये थे। १३६३ ई० १४३६ ईस्वी के मध्य तैमूरलंग के पौत्र उलूकवेग ने भी वेध के क्षेत्र में सराहनीय प्रयास किया था। उलूकवेग समरकन्द का बादशाह एवं खगोल विद्या का प्रेमी था। अतः इसने अपने राज्य में एक वेधशाला का निर्माण कर वेध द्वारा ग्रह नक्षत्रों की अनेक सारगियां निर्मित की थी।&#xA;१५ वीं शताब्दी के अनन्तर कालक्रम से वेध विषयक ज्ञान में वृद्धि हुई। पूर्व प्रचलित शङ्कु यष्टि नलिका इत्यादि यन्त्रों के स्थान पर धातु निर्मित लघु यन्त्रों का प्रयोग होने लगा। कालान्तर में लघु यन्त्रों के परिणाम की स्थूलता देखकर ईंट पत्थर एवं चूर्ण इत्यादि से बड़े आकार के यन्त्रों एवं विस्तृत वेधशालाओं का निर्माण एवं प्रयोग होने लगा। सम्प्रति दूरदर्शक आदि अत्याधुनिक वेध यन्त्र आविष्कृत हो चुके हैं, एवं आज-कल प्रायः इन्हीं आधुनिक यन्त्रों की सहायता से वेध कार्य सम्पादित होते हैं।&#xA;भारतीय वेध परम्परा का स्वर्ण काल महाराज सवाई जय सिंह के काल से प्रारम्भ होता है। यद्यपि जय सिंह के पूर्ववर्ती वेध कुशल दैवज्ञों ने वेधशालाओं का निर्माण कर वेध कार्य सम्पादित किया था, तथापि वेधशालाओं की परम्परा में सवाई जयसिंह की तरह सुव्यवस्थित एवं व्यापक कार्य भारतीय ज्योतिष शास्त्र के इतिहास में नहीं दिखाई देता। इनका जन्म ३ नवम्बर १६८८ ई० को कछवाहा वंशीय आम्बेर नरेश महाराज विशन सिंह तथा महारानी राज कुवँर के घर हुआ था।&amp;rsquo; जय सिंह बाल्यावस्था से कुशाग्रबुद्धि एवं प्रतिभा सम्पन्न थे। आठ वर्ष की अवस्था में ही जयसिंह की वाक्पटुता से प्रसन्न होकर&#xA;औरंगजेब ने इन्हें &amp;lsquo;सवाई&amp;rsquo; की उपाधि प्रदान की थी। १२ वर्ष की अवस्था में ही सवाई जयसिंह को युद्धकला एवं राज्य प्रबन्धन के साथ ही डिंगल संस्कृत फारसी, अरबी, तुरुष्की आदि भाषाओं का सम्यक् ज्ञान हो गया था। यद्यपि जय सिंह ने वेद वेदाङ्गादि अनेक शास्त्रों का अध्ययन किया परन्तु बाल्यकाल से ही स्वाभाविक रूप में खगोल एवं ज्योतिः शास्त्र में उनकी विशेष अभिरुचि थी। कालान्तर में इन्होंने निज गुरु जगन्नाथ सम्राट द्वारा ज्योतिष शास्त्र का अध्ययन एवं अभ्यास कर दक्षता प्राप्त की। अध्ययन एवं अभ्यास के क्रम में जय सिंह ने अनुभव किया कि प्रचलित संस्कृत एवं अरबी भाषाओं के पंचाङ्गों में ग्रह-नक्षत्रों की जो स्थितियां अङ्कित की जाती है उनका वेध द्वारा आकाश में&#xA;दिल्ली वेधशाला १. मिश्रयन्त्र, (यह यन्त्र दक्षिणोत्तरभित्ति, सम्राट, अग्रार्क राशिवलय एवं नियतचक्र यन्त्रों&#xA;का सम्मिलित रूप हैं) २. सम्राट् यन्त्र। ३. धूप घटिकायन्त्र। ४. षष्ठांश यन्त्र। ५. जयप्रकाश यन्त्र। ६. राम&#xA;यन्त्र। जयपुर वेधशाला&#xA;१. लघुसम्राट् यन्त्र। २. सम्राट् यन्त्र। ३. सम्राट् यन्त्र का छत्र। ४. ध्रुवदर्शक यन्त्र। ५. नाड़ीवलय यन्त्र। ६. क्षितिजीय धूपघटिका। ७. क्रान्तिवृत्त यन्त्र। ८. यन्त्र राज। ६. उन्नतांश यन्त्र। १०. दक्षिणोत्तर भित्रि यन्त्र। ११. जयप्रकाश यन्त्र १२. षष्ठांश यन्त्र। १३. राशिवलय यन्त्र। १४. कपाल यन्त्र। १५. चक्र यन्त्र। १६. रामयन्त्र। १७. दिगंश यन्त्र। १८. यन्त्रराज।&#xA;उज्जैन वेधशाला&#xA;१. सम्राट् यन्त्र २. दक्षिणोत्तरभित्ति यन्त्र। ३. नाडीवलय यन्त्र। ४. दिगंश यन्त्र। ५. शंकु यन्त्र। ६. दिक्साधक यन्त्र। ७. धूप घटिका यन्त्र। वाराणसी वेधशाला&#xA;१. सम्राट् यन्त्र। २. लघु सम्राट् यन्त्र। ३. दक्षिणोत्तरभित्ति यन्त्र। ४. नाड़ीवलय यन्त्र। ५. दिगंश यन्त्र। ६. चक्र यन्त्र।&#xA;१.&#xA;सवाईजयसिंह, बी० भटनागर, पृष्ट ६.&#xA;२२६&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;सम्प्रति मथुरा वेधशला का अस्तित्व समाप्त हो चुका हैं, परन्तु लिखित प्रमाणों से ज्ञात होता है कि यहाँ विषुववृत्तीय यन्त्र, छादिसमस्थानक यन्त्र, षष्ठांश यन्त्र एवं क्षितिजवृत्त यन्त्रों का निर्माण हुआ था। इन वेधशालाओं में अनवरत वेध सम्पादन पूर्वक जयसिंह ने ग्रह-नक्षत्रों की अनेक सारणियों का निर्माण कराया जिसके द्वारा सधित ग्रह दृक्तुल्य होते थे। सवाई जय सिंह की इच्छा से इनके गुरु जगन्नाथ सम्राट ने दिल्ली-जयपुर आदि वेधशालाओं में वेध सम्पादित कर प्राप्त परिणामों की समीक्षा पूर्वक अरबी भाषा में &amp;lsquo;जिजमुहम्मदशाही&amp;quot; तथा संस्कृत भाषा में &amp;lsquo;सिद्धान्त सम्राट् नामक ग्रन्थों की रचना की। इस ग्रन्थ में उलूगवेग आदि प्राचीन वेध कर्ताओं के सिद्धान्तों से तुलना कर ग्रह-ग्रहगति इत्यादि का आनयन किया गया हैं। इन्होंने जयसिंह द्वारा स्थापित वेधशालाओं में अनेक बार वेधकर ग्रहों की गति स्थिति आदि का निर्धारण किया था। इनके द्वारा किये गये वेधों से प्राप्त परिणामों का उल्लेख &amp;lsquo;सिद्धान्त सम्राट्&amp;rsquo; ग्रन्थ में दिखाई देता हैं।&#xA;वेध एवं वेध शालाओं की परम्परा के सन्दर्भ में गणपतिदेव शास्त्री ने &amp;lsquo;दृक्सिद्धपञ्चाङ्ग निर्माण पद्धति&amp;rsquo; की भूमिका में लिखा हैं कि दृग्गाणितैक्य सम्पादन की परम्परा ग्रहलाघवकार गणेश देवज्ञ के काल तक अनवच्छिन्न रूप में दिखाई देती हैं, परन्तु तदनन्तर इस परम्परा में सवाई जयसिंह का ही योगदान प्रशंसनीय हैं। जयसिंह के अनन्तर आधुनिक वेध कर्ताओं में सर्व प्रथम वेंकटेशवापूशास्त्री केतकर महोदय का नाम स्मरणीय है। इन्होंने प्राच्य पाश्चात्य ग्रहगणित के समन्वय से १८१८ शक में सूक्ष्म सिद्धान्त मण्डित ‘केतकी ग्रह गणित&amp;rsquo; नामक ग्रन्थ की रचना की है। इसी क्रम में १८३५ ई० के उड़ीसा प्रान्त के सामन्त चन्द्र शेखर का भी वेध के क्षेत्र में योगदान स्मरणीय हैं। इन्होंने दृग्गणितैवय सम्पादन के लिए प्राचीन ग्रन्थों में उद्धृत यन्त्र वर्णन के अनुसार कुछ यन्त्रों का निर्माण कर वेध द्वारा सिद्धान्त दर्पण नामक ग्रन्थ की रचना की। ज्योतिष शास्त्र के आधुनिक वेध परम्परा में डॉ० मेघनाद साहा, प्रो० एस० चन्द्रशेखर, डॉ० चन्द्रिका प्रसाद, डॉ० हरिकेशव सेन, डॉ० रामसिंह कुशवाहा, श्री गोरख प्रसाद, महामहोपाध्याय डॉ० सुधाकर द्विवेदी, डॉ० सम्पूर्णानन्द, पं० कल्याण दत्त शर्मा इत्यादि दैवज्ञ अभिनन्दनीय तथा स्मरणीय हैं। इन लोगों ने वेध के क्षेत्र में विदेशों में भी ख्याति आर्जित की हैं। - १३ वीं शताब्दी में &amp;lsquo;पोप ग्रिगरी&amp;rsquo; द्वारा रचित &amp;lsquo;वांशिगटन&amp;rsquo; वेधशाला पाश्चात्य देशीय वेध शालाओं में उपलब्ध सबसे प्रचीनतम वेधशाला हैं। उसमें आज भी वेध कार्य सुचारु रूप से होते हैं।&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;ज्योतिर्विनोद&amp;rsquo; नामक ग्रन्थ के अनुसार सम्प्रति अमेरिका जैसी विशालतम वेधशालायें अन्य किसी राष्ट्र में नहीं हैं। इनमें तीन वेधशालायें प्रमुख हैं- १. लिंक वेधशाला २. प्रो० लावेल की वेधशाला, ३. हार्वर्ड विश्व विद्यालयस्थ वेधशाला। रामनाथ सहाय के&#xA;वेध एवं वेधशालाओं की परम्परा&#xA;२२७ अनुसार अमेरिका के कैलीफोर्निया प्रान्त में &amp;lsquo;फ्लोमर&amp;rsquo; पर्वत पर स्थित वेधशाला आधुनिक वेधशालाओं में अग्रणी हैं। आधुनिक भारतीय वेधशालाओं में मद्रास वेधशाला-&amp;lsquo;ईस्ट इंडिया&amp;rsquo; कंपनी द्वारा निर्मित है। इसका निर्माण जलपोतों के आवागमन हेतु ग्रह क्षत्रों की सहायता से काल एवं दिशा ज्ञान के लिए किया गया था।&#xA;कोडाईकनाल वेधशाला- तमिलनाडु प्रदेश के कोडाईकनाल नामक स्थान पर लगभग ८००० फुट की ऊचाई पर स्थित यह वेधशाला सौर वेधशाला के रूप में विश्रुत हैं, क्यों कि यहाँ सौर अनुसन्धान की विशेष व्यवस्था हैं।&#xA;__उटकमण्ड-वेधशाला-नीलगिरि पर्वत पर &amp;lsquo;टाटा मूलभूत अनुसन्धान संस्थान&amp;rsquo; के द्वारा स्थापित वेधशाला अद्वितीय है। इसमें एक विशाल रेड़ियों दूरदर्शक यन्त्र स्थापित हैं।&#xA;उस्मानिया वेधशाला-उस्मानिया विश्वविद्यालय के खम्मल विज्ञान विभाग द्वारा हैदराबाद में स्थापित यह वेधशाला अत्यन्त सुव्यवस्थित हैं। यहाँ अनेक दूरदर्शक यन्त्र हैं।&#xA;उदयपुर वेधशाला-राजस्थान प्रान्त के उदयपुर नगर में फतेहसागर जलाशय के निकट १६७५ ई० में स्थापित यह वेधशाला उत्तम हैं।&#xA;नैनीताल वेधशाला- उत्तरांचल प्रदेश के नैनीताल शहर में उत्तर प्रदेश सरकार द्वारा १६५५ ई० में स्थापित यह वेधशाला उत्कृष्ट रूप में खगोल विषय अनुसन्धान में सतत प्रयत्नशील हैं।&#xA;इन आधुनिक वेधशालाओं के अतिरिक्त राष्ट्र के अनेक भागों में कृत्रिम तारामण्डल भी स्थापित हैं।&#xA;१. अर्वाचीनं ज्योतिर्विज्ञानम्, पृ० २०० ।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed that the disinclination of philologists to allow for the &amp;ldquo;essential&amp;rdquo; connection of Chronos and Kronos rests upon the stern belief that the &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo; Saturn has nothing to do with the planet Saturn, and upon the supposition that an expert in classical philology has nothing whatever to learn from Indian texts. Were it not so, they might have stumbled over Kāla, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Yama, i.e., Kronos, alias the planet Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;agrayana-and-orion&#34;&gt;Agrayana and Orion.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have already stated in brief my reasons for provisiopally identifying Sk. Agrayana with Gk. Orion, and here I wish to examine the point more fully, not because my case rests upon it, bnt simply with a view to indicate the real nature of the objections that may be urged against the proposed identification. If philologists are still inclined to hold that the identification is not even probable, we shall have to look for some other Aryan derivation, as the similarity of the Eastern and Western traditions of Orion is, in my opioion, too strong to be accidental.&#xA;Agrayana is evidently derived from agra and ayana, Of these ayana, which is derived from i, to go, may be represent ed by ion in Greek ; cf. Sk. @yus, Gk, aiön Sk. comparative termination (nom. sin.) iyān Gk. ion; Sk. termination dyana, as in Gargyayana, Gk iön, as in Kronion, &amp;rsquo;the descen dant of Kronos&amp;rsquo;. The initial ā in Sk. Agrayana may also become in Greek; as in Sk. ashayana, Gk õkeanos; Sk. dshu Gk, ökus, Sanskrit Ägrayana inay therefore be represent. ed by Ogriön in Greck, and we have now to see if g may be dropped before and Ogrion can be changed into Orion. It is a general phonetic rule in Teutonic languages that a gutteral may disappear before a liquid, whether initially or medially ; cf. Ger, nagel, Eng. nail ; hagel and hail; regen and rain; Sk, kravis, O. H. G. rõ. Prof. Max Mūller has extended the application of this rule 10 Latin and Greek, and Latin and French in his Lectures on the Science of Language, Vol. II., p. 309. He compares Lalin paganus with French paien, Gk, lāchne&amp;rsquo; With Lat, lāna; and points 222&#xA;APPENDIX.&#xA;out that on the same principle luman stands for lucmen, examen for exagmen, Hamma for fagma. K. Brugmann (Oom. Gr. I., 9023.) would derive 0, Ir. dr, Cymr, aer from &amp;ldquo;agro on the same principle. This shows that Sk. agra may be easily represented by ār in Teutonic languages. We may account for the change in two ways. We may cither suppose that the final gutteral of a root is sometimes dropped before terminations begioning with a liquid and thus put luc-men = lu-men, fulg-men-ful-men, Ang-mens Aa-men, ag-men-d-men, ag-11 - dura ( with compensation vowel lengthening; Bopp derives Sk, roman, a hair from ruh-man growing, on the same principle); or we may suppose that the change is in accordance with general phonetic rule which sanctions the omission of a gutteral before a liquid in such cases. But whichsoever explanation we adopt, there no question as to the change itself, It must pot, however, be supposed the rule is an uninflexible one, and that a gutteral must always be dropped before a liquid; for we find that gutteral in such cases is often cither retained or labialised. cf. Sk. gravan, O. Ir. broo, bro, (gen. broon), Cymr, breuan; Sk. spindmi, Q. Ir. gair. The proper rule to deduce from these instances would therefore be, thal gr in Sanskrit may be represented by gr, br or r in Teutonic languages, and that all the three changes are possible.&#xA;Can we pot extend the rule to Greek and Sanskrit? is the next question we have to coosider. I do not mean to deny that there are phunetic rules which are not univer. sally applicable to all languages. But the present rule can be easily shewn not to belong to this clāss. Prof. Max Māller has already extended it to Greek and Latin and&#xA;APPENDIX.&#xA;Vararuchi, in his Prakrita Prakasha II. 2, lays down that &amp;amp; in ga may be medially dropped as between Sanskrit and Prakrit, 6. 8. Sk. sagara, Pk. sa-ara; Sk. nagara, Pk. na-ar, eventually corrupted into nara, as in Jun-nara and other names of cities. This is, in fact, the same rule which, when applied to Teutonic languages, accounts for the change of segel into sail, nagel into nail and so on. Comparison of Avestic tigra with Mod. Per. tir shews that a similar change may also take place between those languages. We may, therefore, fairly say that the rule about the omission of gutteral before a liquid obtains not only in Teutonic langa. ages, but also between Greek and Latio, Latin and French Sanskrit and Old Irish, Sanskrit and Prakrit, and Avestir. and Modera Persian. In the face of these facts it would, I think, be uaduly restricting the applicability of the phonetic rule if we refuse to apply it to Sanskrit and Greek. There is at any rate no a priori improbability in expecting that a similar change may take place as between Greek and Sanskrit. Let Us Dow see if there are any instances as between Greek and Sanskrit to support such a conclusion.&#xA;Prof. Benfey compares Sk. grāvan with Gk. laas (Lat. lapis); and Sk. ghrāno with Gk, nis, rinos. If this comparison is correct, here at least we have two instancos where a gutteral before r in Sanskrit is lost in Greek. It is some. times labialised, as in Sk. krinami, Gk, priami ; Sk guru, Gk, barus ; and sometimes retained as it is, as in Sk, kralu, Gk, kratus ; Sk, gras, Gk, grao, to swallow. From these instances we may therefore infer that as belween Greek and Sanskrit, the initial cutleral in kr or gr in Sanskrit may be either retained as it is, or labialised or dropped in&#xA;rannan nama polim mhich holds good, as shown above,&#xA;224&#xA;APPENDIX&#xA;in Teutonic languages. It may be noticed here ihal while grdvan becomes laos in Greek, it is broon in Old Irish, that is, while the initial g of a Sanskrit word is labialised in Old Irish it is.dropped in Greek. This shews that the initial kr or gr in Sanskrit may be differently represented in different languages. Sanskrit kṣimis, Lat, vermis, Gk, elmis, and Sk. Rlipta, Avestic kerepta, Gk, raptos, may, I think, also be regard. ed as further illustrations of the same rule. I know that the connection between the words last quoted is still considered doubtful, but that is because the rule about the omission of a guiteral before a liquid, as between Greek and Sanskrit, is not yet recognised by scholars. If the examples I have given at the beginning of this paragraph are, however, sufficient to justify us in applying the rule to Greek and Sanskrit, the instances last cited may be taken as further supporting the same view.&#xA;With these instances before us, it would be unreasonable to deny that the three possible changes of kr and gr, which obtain in Teutonic languages, do not take place as between Greek and Sanskrit, at least initially; and if these changes take place initially, a nalogy at once suggests that they would also take place medially. At any rate there is no reason why they should not. It may be urged that a comparison of Sk, chakra with Gk, kuklos shews that a medial kr is retained as it is. But as pointed out above the argument is not conclusive. There may be cases where kr is retained as it is. But we have seen that by the side of such cases, instances can be quoted where it&amp;rsquo; is changed to pr or r initially; and we may expect the same Lhreefold possible change medially. It is admitted that labiali. sation takes place medially; and we have therefore to see if there are any instances where a gutteral is dropped before a liamid io tome body of word. K. Brmamann tells us that&#xA;APPENDIX.&#xA;225&#xA;at one period gn and gm came to be represented by n and m in Greek; cf. gignomai and ginomai, stugnos and stunos. Now this change in the budy of a word is exactly similar to that of agnien inlo amen, and is evidently due to the same rule, which accounts for the latter change. Similarly Gk. anoos may be compared with Sk. ajna, aad Gk. arinos 10 Sk. aghrana. But I do not lay much stress on these inasmuch as these words may be supposed to have been derived by the addition of the prefix alpha to the already existing Greek forms, and not directly obtained from Sanskrit ajna and aghrāna. The chaoge of gignonai into ginomai or of gignosko into ginosko cannot, however, be so accounted for, and if so before n is dropped in the body of a word, there is no reason why it should not be dropped before r on the analogy of the phonetic rule given above. Works oa philology do not give any more instances of such changes, but as observed above, the attention of scholars does not appear to have been direct. ed to this point. Otherwise I do not think it was difficult to discover the similarity between Gk. turos and Sk. takra. Takra is derived from tanch (*teng) lo coatract, to coagulate or curdle, and according to Fick the root is Iado Germanic. It is an old Vedic root, and we have such expressions as dadhna dlanakti coagulates (milk) with curds&amp;rsquo; in the Taittirīya saṁhitā II. 5. 3.8. Takra therefore literally means &amp;lsquo;curdled milk&amp;rsquo; and not curds mixed with water &amp;lsquo;as the word is understood in modera Sanskrit. Now, if we suppose that the rule, which saactions the omission of g or k before y or m in other languages, also holds good as between Greek and Sanskrit, not only initially (as in grivan aad laos) but also medially, as in ginomai and ginomai, Sk takra may be casily identified with Gk, duros meaning &amp;ldquo;cheese&amp;rsquo;. Takra may&#xA;hanne lova, amell ob man maono mariniramo in na rin anim&#xA;a le&#xA;226&#xA;APPENDIX.&#xA;Turas is an old Greek word used in the Odyssey, and it ha not yet been explained by anything in Iado-Germanic. D Schrader therefore records a suggestion that it should b derived from Turko Tataric turak. But if Sanskrit sāra an sarpis are found in Greek oros (whey) and elphos (bulter) is not reasonable to suppose that turos alone was borrowe from a pop-Aryan source. Takra in modern Sanskrit meat&#xA;curds mixed with water and churned&amp;rsquo; and perhaps it may b contended that we cannot identify it with furos, which mean *cheese, I have, however, shewn that takra etymologicall means &amp;lsquo;curdled milk&amp;rsquo; and aot &amp;lsquo;curds dissolved in water&amp;rsquo; whic is evideatly its secondary meaning. Besides when we see the sara which in Sanskrit denotes &amp;lsquo;curdled milk,&amp;rsquo; has becom oros - whey in Greek, and serum in Latin, there is nothin unusual if we find takra and turos used in slightly differen seases in the two languages. I have already suggested in th body of the essay that we may ideatify Sk. Shukra with Gk Kupris. Chakra kuklos, Shukra. Kupris, and takra=turos may thus be taken to illustrate the application of the rul above discussed, regarding the three-fold change of kr or g to Greek and Sanskrit medially; and instances have bee already quoted to show that the rule holds good initially a between Greek and Sanskrit. We may therefore conclude tha the change of signomai into ginomai is not a solitary instance and that as a general rule &amp;amp; may be dropped, labialised o retained before a liquid as between Greek and Sanskrit whethe at the beginning or in the body of a word. We might eve discover further instances of the applicability of this rule for, if takra is thus correctly identified with turos, we may, oi the same principle, identify 8k, agra with Gk. oros, meanin, top summit. It was impossible to represcot Sanskrit agri frumemmomnandha mamlama mo laman 1 million con amor&#xA;APPENDIX.&#xA;227&#xA;sented by agros in Greek as the latter word corresponded to Sk, ajra, a field ; nor can agra be changed to akris which represented Sk. ashri. Sanskrit agra, therefore, naturally came to be represented by oros. Oros, meaning top or sum. mit, has not yet been satisfactorily derived in any other way.&#xA;It will be seen from the above that we have sufficient grounds to hold that the rule about the omission of a gutteral before a liquid, whether initially or medially, applies to Greek and Sanskrit in the same way as it does to other languages; and if so, Sk. Agrayana can be represented by Orion in Greek.&#xA;I have already quoled Brugmann to show that *agra becomes ār or aer in Teutonic languages. Now further com paring Lat. integri, integer with Fr. entier ; Gk. dakru, Goth. tagr with Eng. tear; pagan with paien and regen with rain, we are led to infer that where k org is dropped before y or a liquid we may expect two contiguous vowels, probably because this gr is at first optionally altered into ger or gar. We can now understand why Orion was sometimes spelt as Oarion; and the existence of this double form cooörms, in my opinion, the derivation above suggested. As for union alone we might derive it from oros, limit, or āra, spring, and ion, going thus, giving the same meaniog, viz., the lirit of the beginning of the year or spring, as Agrayana in Sanskrit. But this does not account for the double form Orion and Qarion&amp;ndash;unless the latter be taken for a poetic or a dialectic variation of Orion. I therefore prefer to derive the word from Sanskrit Agrayana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XII — Socrates&amp;rsquo; Last Tale&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Al suo aspetto tal dentro mi fei&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Qual si fe&amp;rsquo; Glauco nel ustar dell&amp;rsquo; erba&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Che il fe&amp;rsquo; consorto in mar degli altri dei.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DANTE, &lt;em&gt;Paradiso&lt;/em&gt; 1.67&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WHAT A MAN has to say in the last hours of is life deserves attention. Most especially if that man be Socrates, awaiting execution in his jail and conversing with Pythagorean friends. He has already left the world behind, has made his philosophical will and is now quietly communing with his own truth. This is the close of the &lt;em&gt;Phaedo&lt;/em&gt; (107D-115A), and it is expressed in the form of a myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. गिरिजाशंकर शास्त्री&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;कहा जाता है कि &amp;lsquo;अलीइब्नजियाद अलतमीमी&amp;rsquo; नामक अरबी ग्रन्थकार ने &amp;lsquo;जीजल शहरयार&amp;rsquo; नामक पुस्तक का फारसी से अनुवाद किया था। पुस्तक के नाम से स्पष्ट होता. है कि यह ज्योतिष शास्त्र की पुस्तक थी। जिस समय अलेबरुनी ने अपना ग्रन्थ &amp;lsquo;काल गणना&amp;rsquo; लिखी, उस समय यह ग्रन्थ विद्यमान था।&amp;rsquo; इसी ग्रन्थ से प्रसिद्ध ज्योतिक्षी अलख्वारिज्मी ने फारसी ज्योतिष संबंधी जानकारी प्राप्त की थी जिसका परिचय उसने खलीफा मामू की आज्ञानुसार बनाए हुए अपने ग्रन्थ के सार में दिया है। अलख्वारिज्मी का पूरा नाम अबू अब्दुल्ला मुहम्मद इब्न-मूसा-अलख्वारिज्मी था। इसका जन्म ख्वारेज्म प्रदेश के खीवा नगर वर्तमान उजबेकिस्तान में ७८३ ई० में हुआ था। इसके करीब दो सौ साल बाद अलबेरुनी (६७३-१०४८ ई०) भी ख्वारेज्म में ही पैदा हुआ था।&#xA;अलख्वारिज्मी ने भारत में खोजी गयी शून्य-सहित दस अंकों पर आधारित स्थानमान अंक-पद्धति का परिचय देने के लिए अरबी में एक पुस्तक लिखी थी। बारहवीं ईसवी में इस पुस्तक का लैटिन में अनुवाद हुआ था। लैटिन में इसका नाम है-लिबेर अलगोरिज्मी दे न्यूमेरो इन्दोरम अर्थात् हिन्द के अंकों के बारे में अलख्वारिज्मी की पुस्तक। यूरोप में यह पुस्तक इतनी अधिक लोकप्रिय हुई कि भारतीय अंक-पद्धति से की जाने वाली गणनाओं के अर्थ में वहाँ ‘अलगोरिज्म&amp;rsquo; शब्द ही रूढ़ हो गया। भारतीय अंकों पर आधारित अंकगतिण के अर्थ में इस शब्द के विभिन्न रूप यूरोपीय भाषाओं में सदियों तक प्रचलित रहे। संगणकों के लिए गतिण के सूत्रों को दिए जाने वाले विशिष्ट रूप के अर्थों में आज भी &amp;lsquo;अलबोरिथम&amp;rsquo; शब्द का खूब प्रयोग होता है।&#xA;_ अलख्वारिज्मी ने अंकगणित के विषय में जो ग्रन्थ लिखा, उसका अरबी नाम था &amp;lsquo;हिसाब अल्-हिन्द&amp;rsquo; या &amp;lsquo;किताब अल्-जाम व तफरीक बि हिसाब &amp;lsquo;अल्-हिन्द&amp;rsquo; अर्थात्, हिन्द के हिसाब में जोड़ और घटाने की पुस्तक। इस पुस्तक में शून्य पर आधारित नयी दाशमिक स्थानमान अंक-पद्धति में अंकगणित को समझाया गया है। इस अंक-पद्धति का आविष्कार भारत में हुआ था, इसलिए अल-ख्वारिज्मी तथा अनेक अरबी गणितज्ञों ने इसे &amp;lsquo;हिन्द का हिसाब&amp;rsquo; कहा है। अल्-ख्वारिज्मी की इस पुस्तक से पहले इस्लामी देशों को और बाद में यूरोप को व्यापक जानकारी मिली। अल-ख्वारिज्मी की यह पुस्तक मूल अरबी में आज उपलब्ध नहीं है, पर इसका लैटिन अनुवाद प्राप्य है। इंग्लैण्ड में बाथ स्थान के निवासी&#xA;अरबी एवं भारतीय ज्योतिष&#xA;२२६ ‘एदेलार्द&amp;rsquo; ने ११२६ ई० के आस-पास स्पेन के एक अरबी विद्या केन्द्र में इस पुस्तक का अनुवाद किया था। इस पुस्तक ने यूरोप के गणितज्ञों को इतना अधिक प्रभावित किया कि वहाँ नयी भारतीय अंक-पद्धति से की जाने वाली गणनाओं के लिए अल-ख्वारिज्मी का ही नाम (अलगोरिज्म) प्रचलित हो गया।&#xA;__ अल्-ख्वारिज्मी ने अपनी पुस्तक में जिन भारतीय अंकों का प्रयोग किया है, उन अंकों को &amp;lsquo;गुबार अंक&amp;rsquo; (हरूफ अल्-गुबार) कहा है। ये अंक भारतीय है, जो ब्राह्मी अंकों से विकसित हुए है। अरबों के साथ यही अंक स्पेन में पहुंचे और बाद में यूरोप में फैले। स्पेन में लिखी गई ६७६ ई० की एक हस्तलिपि में पहली बार भारतीय मूल के ये अंक देखने को मिलते है। दसवीं सदी के एक यूरोपीय विद्वान् ‘झेरबार&amp;rsquo; ने भारतीय अंकों के प्रचार का बड़ा काम किया। स्पेन के यहूदी विद्वान् &amp;lsquo;रब्बी बेन एजरा&amp;rsquo; (१०६५-११६७ ई०) ने भारतीय अंक तथा अंक गणित की जानकारी देने के लिए एक पुस्तक लिखी थी। इतालवी गणितज्ञ &amp;lsquo;लियोनार्दो&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;फिबोनकी&amp;rsquo; (लगभग ११७०-१२४५ ई०) ने भारतीय अंकों के प्रचार में बड़ा योगदान दिया, परन्तु यूरोप के गणितज्ञों पर सबसे अधिक प्रभाव अल्-ख्वारिज्मी की &amp;lsquo;हिसाब अल्-हिन्द&amp;rsquo; पुस्तक का ही पड़ा है।&#xA;अल्-ख्वारिज्मी की बीजगणित से संबंधित पुस्तक है: &amp;lsquo;किताब अल्-जब्र&amp;rsquo; व &amp;lsquo;अल्-मुकाबिलह&amp;rsquo;। यहां &amp;lsquo;जब्र&amp;rsquo; का अर्थ है &amp;lsquo;पुनःस्थापना&amp;rsquo; और &amp;lsquo;मुकाबिलह&amp;rsquo; का अर्थ है &amp;lsquo;समान करना&amp;rsquo;। ये समीकरणों की रचना से संबंधित है। इस पुस्तक में अल-ख्वारिज्मी ने भारतीय बीजगणित की नयी विधियों को अपनाया है। अल्-ख्वारिज्मी के लिए ब्रह्मगुप्त (६२८ ई०) का बीजगणित अरबी अनुवाद में पहले से उपलब्ध था। अल्-ख्वारिज्मी ने बीजगणित का अपना यह ग्रन्थ बगदाद में ८२५ ई० के आस-पास रचा और इसे उसने अपने आश्रयदाता खलीफा अल्-मामू को समर्पित किया। अल्-ख्वारिज्मी की बीजगणित की इस पुस्तक का इंग्लैण्ड के चेस्टर निवासी &amp;lsquo;राबर्ट&amp;rsquo; ने ११४५ ई० के आस-पास स्पेन के एक अरबी विद्याकेन्द्र में बैठकर लैटिन में अनुवाद किया। लैटिन में बीजगणित पर यह पहली पुस्तक थी, इसलिए इसके अरबी नाम का &amp;lsquo;अल-जब्र&amp;rsquo; शब्द &amp;lsquo;अलजब्रा&amp;rsquo; बनकर यूरोप की भाषाओं में बीजगणित के अर्थ में रूढ़ हो गया।&#xA;अरबी वैज्ञानिक ज्योतिष के अध्ययन और इसमें त्रिकोणमिति के उपयोग को बड़ा महत्व देते थे। अल्-ख्वारिज्मी ने ज्योतिष-सारणियों और ज्या (साइन) तथा स्पर्शज्या (टैंजेट) सारणियों पर भी अरबी में एक पुस्तक लिखी थी, जिसका बाद में लैटिन में अनुवाद हुआ था। अल्-ख्वारिज्मी का ज्योतिष-विवेचन भारतीय ज्योतिष के सिद्धान्त-ग्रन्थों पर आधारित था। आर्यभट (४६६ ई०) के ग्रन्थ में त्रिकोणमिति का विवेचन है और ज्या-सारणी भी दी गई है। अरबी में त्रिकोणमिति भारतीय पद्धति की है, टालमी की त्रिकोणमिति पर आधारित नहीं। इसका एक स्पष्ट प्रमाण यह है कि आज त्रिकोणमिति में&#xA;१. &amp;ldquo;क्रोनोलोजी आफ एन्शियन्ट नेशन्स&amp;rdquo;-एडवर्ड सी० साचाऊ, लन्दन। २. डर्क जे० स्त्रुइक, ए कन्साइज हिस्ट्री आफ मैथेमेटिक्स, लन्दन १६५६ ।२३१&#xA;२३०&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड प्रचलित यूरोप का &amp;lsquo;साइन&amp;rsquo; शब्द संस्कृत के &amp;lsquo;जीवा&amp;rsquo; शब्द से बना है। अरबी अनुवादकों ने संस्कृत के जीवा शब्द को ज्यों-का-त्यों अपनाकर इसे अरबी अक्षरों में &amp;lsquo;ज-ब&amp;rsquo; के रूप में लिखा था। लैटिन अनुवादकों ने इसे &amp;lsquo;जेब&amp;rsquo; (कुरते में छाती के ऊपर लगाने वाला पाकिट) समझकर इसका अनुवाद &amp;lsquo;सिनुस्&amp;rsquo; (छाती) किया। सिनुस् से ही &amp;lsquo;साइन&amp;rsquo; शब्द बना है।&#xA;अल्-ख्वारिजमी ने बगदाद की वेधशाला में वेधकार्य तो किया ही, साथ-साथ ज्योतिष-यंत्रों और सूर्य-घड़ी पर भी एक पुस्तक लिखी। इसने &amp;lsquo;भूगोल&amp;rsquo; पर भी एक पुस्तक लिखी थी- &amp;lsquo;किताब सूरत अल्-अर्ज&amp;rsquo; (धरती का विवण)। इसमें ३८ मानचित्र थे, जिनमें से केवल चार बचे हैं। इन मानचित्रों में दो हजार से भी अधिक अरबी में यह पहली कृति थी।&amp;rsquo;&#xA;_ अल्-ख्वारिज्मी ने इतिहास के विषय में भी एक पुस्तक लिखी थी- &amp;lsquo;किताब अल्-तारीख&amp;rsquo;। आज यह पुस्तक उपलब्ध नहीं है, पर मध्ययुग के अरबी ग्रन्थों में इसका अनेक स्थानों पर उल्लेख मिलता है। ८५० ई० के आस-पास अल-ख्वारिज्मी का देहान्त&#xA;हुआ।&#xA;अरबी एवं भारतीय ज्योतिष ग्रन्थों का अनुवाद कुछ बाद में हुआ। अलबेरुनी के भारत के अनुवादक एडवर्ड साचाऊ ने भी लिखा है- “पूर्व के देशों में ज्ञान-विज्ञान के इतिहास में ब्रह्मगुप्त का स्थान बहुत ऊँचा है। अरबवासियों को टालमी के ग्रन्थ का पता लगने से पहले उन्हें ब्रह्मगुप्त ने ज्योतिषशास्त्र सिखाया।&amp;quot;&#xA;भारतीय अंकों की जानकारी अरबों को शायद पहले ही मिल गयी थी। पर ब्रह्मगुप्त के ग्रन्थों के साथ उन्होंने भारतीय अंक-पद्वति तथा-संकेतों को पूरी तरह अपना लिया। बाद में महान् इस्लामी गणितज्ञ अल-ख्वारिज्मी (जन्म ७८३ ई०) ने एक पुस्तक भारतीय अंक पद्धति पर और एक पुस्तक बीजगणित पर लिखी, जिसमें भारतीय बीजगणित की कई विधियों का समावेश किया। बाद में अल-ख्वारिज्मी के इन दोनों ग्रन्थों का लैटिन में अनुवाद हुआ। यूरोप की भाषाओं में प्रचलित ‘अलगोरिथम&amp;rsquo; शब्द अल-ख्वारिज्मी से और &amp;lsquo;अलजब्रा&amp;rsquo; शब्द उनके बीजगणित की पुस्तक के नाम पर अस्तित्व में आया है। यूरोप के बौद्धिक नवजागरण में अरबी ज्ञान-विज्ञान ने महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका अदा की है।&amp;rsquo;&#xA;भारतीय इतिहासकारों के अनुसार भारत की पुस्तकें और विचार दो भिन्न-भिन्न मार्गों से बगदाद में पहुँचे। कुछ तो संस्कृत से अरबी में अनुवाद द्वारा सीधे गये और कुछ ईरान से होकर अर्थात् पहले इनका संस्कृत (पाली, प्राकृत) से फारसी में भाषान्तर हुआ&#xA;और फिर वहाँ से अरबी में। इस रीति से कलीला और दिमना की कहानियां और चिकित्सा शास्त्र पर एक पुस्तक सम्भवतः प्रसिद्ध ग्रन्थ चरक संहिता अरबियों को प्राप्त हुई थीं। भारत और बगदाद में यह व्यवहार न केवल दो मार्गों से हुआ है बल्कि साथ ही दो भिन्न-भिन्न कालों&#xA;७४३-७७४ ई० तक सिन्ध देश पर खलीफा मन्सूर का शासन था। इस समय सिन्ध से बगदाद में दूत आते-जाते रहते थे। इनमें प्रायः अनेक विद्वान् भी रहा करते थे, किसी समय एक भारतीय विद्वान् जिसका नाम संभवतः कङ्क या काङ्कायन था, जो अपने साथ ब्रह्मगुप्त का ब्रह्मसिद्धान्त (सिन्द-हिन्द अथवा सिन्धिक) और खण्डखाद्य (अल्-अरकन्द) लाया था। इसी की सहायता से अलफजारी ने और सम्भवतः याकूब इब्न तारिक ने भी उसका भाषान्तर किया था। अलफजारी और याकूब इब्न-तारिक का नाम प्रायः अरबी ज्योतिष के ग्रन्थों में एक साथ ही आता है। इससे ऐसा अनुमान होता है कि इन दो लेखकों के मध्य अवश्य ही कोई निकट का सम्बन्ध था। सम्भव है ये दोनों इन्हीं काकायन के शिष्य रहे होंगे। अलबेरुनी ने अपने ग्रन्थ में दोनों का प्रायः साथ-साथ उल्लेख किया है। तथापि वह अलफजारी से अधिक याकूब इब्न-तारिक का उद्धरण देता है। अरबी ज्योतिष में (सिन्द-हिन्द अथवा सिन्धिक) और खण्डखाद्य (अल्-अरकन्द) इन दोनों पुस्तकों का&#xA;ब्रह्मगुप्त ६२० ई० में जब अपने ब्राह्मस्फुट सिद्धान्त की रचना कर रहे थे, तब मुहम्मद पैगम्बर जीवित थे। मुहम्मद साहब के उत्तराधिकारी खलीफाओं का इस्लामी शासन पूर्व में सिन्ध प्रान्त से लेकर पश्चिम में स्पेन तक फैल गया। अब्बासी खलीफा अल मंसूर (७५४-७७५ ई०) ने दजला नदी के पश्चिमी तट पर ७६२ ई० में राजधानी बगदाद की स्थापना की। बगदाद का वैभव तेजी से बढ़ता गया। अल मंसूर के शासनकाल में ही पहली बार संस्कृत के गणित-ज्योतिष के ग्रन्थों का अरबी में अनुवाद शुरू हुआ। इस संबंध में पता चलता है कि सिन्ध से एक दूत मण्डली अल-मंसूर के दरबार में पहुंची थी। अल्-मंसूर के आदेश से उन ग्रन्थों का अरबी में अनुवाद किया गया। यह ७७२-७३ ई० की घटना है।&#xA;अरबी में सिन्द हिन्द और अल-अरकंद नामक ग्रन्थों की बड़ी ख्याति रही है, हालाँकि ये ग्रन्थ अब उपलब्ध नहीं है। ये ग्रन्थ ब्रह्मगुप्त के ब्राह्मस्फुट सिद्धान्त (सिन्द हिन्द)&#xA;और खण्ड-खाद्यक के (अल्-अरकंद) अरबी अनुवाद थे। पता चलता है कि भारतीय पण्डितों के सहयोग से फारस के विद्वान् याकूब इब्न तारिक और अरब के इब्राहिम अल्-फजारी के बेटे मुहम्मद ने ब्रह्मगुप्त के इन ग्रन्थों का पहली बार अरबी में अनुवाद किया था। बाद में इन ग्रन्थों के अरबी में कई अनुवाद हुए।&#xA;इस प्रकार पहली बार ब्रह्मगुप्त के ग्रन्थों से ही अरबी पण्डितों को भारतीय गणित तथा ज्योतिष सिद्धान्तों की जानकारी मिली थी। अरबी में टालमी और यूक्लिड के यूनानी&#xA;है।&#xA;१. गुणाकर मुले-संसार के महान गणितज्ञ ।&#xA;१. गुणाकर मुले, संसार के महान् गणितज्ञ । २. अरबी साहित्य की उत्पत्ति, पृ० ४२।&#xA;अरबी एवं भारतीय ज्योतिष&#xA;२३३&#xA;२३२&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड बहुत उपयोग हुआ है। इन्हीं ग्रन्थों के आधार पर पहली बार अरबियों को ज्योतिष की वैज्ञानिक विधि का ज्ञान हुआ था। अरबी ज्योतिषियों ने टालमी की अपेक्षा पहले भारतीय आचार्य ब्रह्मगुप्त से शिक्षा प्राप्त की थी। भले ही ब्रह्मगुप्त अरब न जा सकें हों, किन्तु उनके ग्रन्थ ने अरब पहुँचकर वहाँ के लोगों को भारतीय ज्योतिष का परिचय कराया। भारतीय विद्या का दूसरा प्रभाव ७८६-८०८ ई० के मध्य हारु के शासन-काल में आया। पुरोहितों का बर्मक नामक एक कुल शासकों के साथ बल्ख से बगदाद में आया था। कहते हैं बर्मक शब्द भारतीय भाषा से निकला है और इसका अर्थ परमक (बिहार का उच्च पदाधिकारी) है। इसमें सन्देह नहीं कि बर्मक-वंश मुसलमान हो गया था, पर इसके सहयोगी इसे कभी सच्चा मुसलमान नहीं समझते थे। अपनी कुछ मर्यादा के अनुसार ये बर्मक-वंशीय लोग चिकित्सा के अध्ययनार्थ विद्वानों को भारत में भेजा करते थे। इसके अतिरिक्त ये कई भारतीय विद्वानों को सहयोगी बनाकर बगदाद में लाये थे और उन्हें अपने चिकित्सालयों का मुख्य चिकित्सक नियुक्त किया था। ये विद्वान् उनकी आज्ञानुसार चिकित्सा, भैषज्ञ संस्कार, विष विद्या, दर्शन शास्त्र, नक्षत्र विद्या (ज्योतिष) और अन्य विषयों की संस्कृत पुस्तकों का अरबी में अनुवाद किये थे। १८वीं शताब्दी तक मुसलमान विद्वान् बर्मक वंश के वार्ताहर (अर्थात् संदेशवाहक) बन कर कई बार यात्रा करते रहे हैं। अलमुआफक, जो अलबेरुनी के कुछ ही समय पहले हुआ है, इसी प्रकार का वार्ताहर था। _ गणित, फलित ज्योतिष (विशेषतया जातक) औषध और और भैषज्य संस्कार विद्या की पुस्तकों के अतिरिक्त अरबियों ने सर्प विद्या, विष विद्या, शकुन परीक्षा, कवच, पशु चिकित्सा, तत्वज्ञान, तर्क विद्या, आचार शास्त्र, राजनीति और युद्ध विद्या पर भारतीय ग्रन्थों, अनेक कथाओं और बुद्ध की एक जीवनी का भी अरबी में भाषान्तर किया था। अरबियों का मनभाता विषय भारतीय गणित था। अर्कन्दी और अन्य पुस्तकों के प्रकाशन से इस विषय का ज्ञान अरब देश में अधिक फैला। ७७१ ई० में एक भारतीय यात्री बगदाद गया था। वह अपने साथ एक भारतीय ज्योतिष का ग्रन्थ ले गया था। उसी का अनुवाद मुहम्मद-इब्न-इब्राहिम अल फजारि ने मन्सूर की आज्ञानुसार अरबी में किया। यह अरबी भाषा में प्रथम ज्योतिष का ग्रन्थ था।&#xA;थी। इस काल में पृथ्वी की परिधि और व्यास को नापा गया। पृथ्वी की परिधि के सिद्धान्त को सर्व-प्रथम मूसा इब्न-शकादिर के पुत्रों ने कार्यरूप में परिणत किया। उस काल का खगोल-विद्या का सबसे बड़ा ज्ञाता अबु-मुदखिल-इल-लम-हयात-अल-अलफाक था। मामून की ज्योषिभवन के अतिरिक्त उस समय तीन और ज्योतिषशालायें थीं।&amp;rsquo;&#xA;उस काल में खगोल विद्या का सबसे धुरन्धर विद्वान् अब-अबदुल्लाह-मुहम्मद-इब्न जाबिर-अल-बत्तानि था। इसका काल ८७७-६१८ ई० के बीच में माना जाता है। यह साबियन था और हरीन का रहने वाला था। अल-रक्काह में इसने अपनी ज्योतिषशाला बनाई थी। अल-बत्तानि ने सूर्य ग्रहण के विषय में अपना मूल सिद्धान्त प्रतिपादित किया। गणित ज्योतिष के क्षेत्र में इस समय सबसे बड़ा विद्वान् अबु-मशार था। इसके चार ग्रन्थों का लैटिन भाषा में अनुवाद हुआ। इसने इस सिद्धान्त का प्रतिपादन किया कि मनुष्य के जीवन में ग्रहों का बहुत बड़ा स्थान है।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Round this, at the world&amp;rsquo;s ends, two stretch darkling to right and left, set fast in ice and black storms. Between them and the middle zone, two by grace of the Gods have been vouchsafed to feeble mortals; and a path is cut between the two (the ecliptic), wherein the slanting array of the Signs may turn.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Georgics 1&lt;/em&gt;, 233-38).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Jumbled 2 column text needs to be fixed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Bārhaspatya Varṣa)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sidereal period of Jupiter, according to the surya Siddhānta is 4332.32 days which is nearly 11.86 sidereal years. Therefore Jupiter roughly stays for one year in one zodiacal sign, if we calculate by mean motion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was taken advantage of to devise &amp;amp; cycle of 12 Jovian years. If we divide the Sūrya Siddhānta period by 12, we get 361.026721 days which is takon as the length of &amp;amp; Jovian year. This is 4.232 days less than the Sūrya Siddhānta solar year. So if &amp;amp; Jovian year and an ordinary solar year begin on the same day, the Jovian year will begin to fall back, completing a complete retrogression in 8501solar years, according to the Sūrya-Siddhānta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XIII — Of Time and the Rivers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Di, quibus imperium est animarum, umbraeque silentes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et Chaos et Phlegethon, loca tacentia late&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sit mihi fas audita loqui . . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VIRGIL, &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt; VI.264&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SOCRATES&amp;rsquo; INIMITABLE HABIT of discussing serious things while telling an improbable story makes it very much worth while to take a closer look at his strange system of rivers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It appears again in Virgil, almost as a set piece. The &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt; is noble court poetry, and was not intended to say much about the fate of souls; one cannot expect from it the grave explicit Pythagorean indications of Cicero&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dream of Scipio&lt;/em&gt;. But while retaining conventional imagery and the official literary grand style which befitted a glorification of the Roman Empire, it repays attention to its hints, for Virgil was not only a subtle but a very learned poet. Thus, while Aeneas&amp;rsquo; ingress into Hades begins with a clangorous overture of dark woods, specters, somber caves and awesome nocturnal rites, which betoken a real descent into Erebus below the earth, he soon finds himself in a much vaguer landscape. &lt;em&gt;Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram&lt;/em&gt; . . . &amp;ldquo;On they went dimly, beneath the lonely night amid the gloom, through the empty halls of Dis and his unsubstantial realm, even as under the grudging light of an Inconstant moon lies a path in the forest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. शत्रुघ्न त्रिपाठी&#xA;आचार्य नीलकण्ठ का नाम ताजिकशास्त्र के इतिहास में अतिमहत्वपूर्ण माना जाता है। इनके बहुविश्रुत प्रतिभा का आदर समस्त ज्योतिषवेत्ता पद-पद पर करते रहे हैं। ताजिक शास्त्र का “नीलकण्ठी” नामक ग्रन्थ प्राचीन भारतीय ज्योतिष की उदात्त भावना को प्रदर्शित करता है।&#xA;&amp;hellip; आचार्य नीलकण्ठ ने अपने ग्रन्थ “ताजिक नीलकण्ठी में न केवल अपना अपितु अपने पितामहादि का भी परिचय दिया है। आचार्य नीलकण्ठ ने उपसंहाराध्याय में अपना कुल परिचय देते हुये लिखा है&amp;rsquo; - “गर्ग गोत्र में उत्पन्न अनेक गुणों से सुशोभित तथा महाभाष्य के व्याख्याकार त्रिस्कन्ध ज्योतिष शास्त्रज्ञ श्रीमान् चिन्तामणि नामक विद्वान हुए। उनके सुपुत्र अनन्त गुणों से युक्त अनन्त दैवज्ञ हुए। ज्योतिर्वेत्ता आचार्य नीलकण्ठ के पिता अनन्त दैवज्ञ तथा माता पद्मा थे।&#xA;_ भारतीय ज्योतिष इतिहास के प्रामाणिक इतिहासकार श्री शंकर बालकृष्ण दीक्षित ने मराठी भाषा में अनन्त के परिचय प्रसंग में नीलकण्ठ का परिचय दिया है। उन्होंने लिखा है कि आचार्य नीलकण्ठ ने अपना ग्रन्थ शक १५०६ में बनाया। इनका मूल निवास स्थान गोदा नदी के किनारे विदर्भ देश में धर्मपुरी नामक गांव में था। अनन्त वहाँ से अध्ययन के लिए काशी आये और बाद में इनके वंशज काशी में ही निवास करने लगे। आचार्य ने जिस समय नीलकण्ठी ग्रन्थ का निर्माण किया, उस समय इनके पिता अनन्त दैवज्ञ जीवित थे। ऐसा नीलकण्ठ के ‘अस्ति&amp;rsquo; पद से ज्ञात होता है। __ श्री शंकर बालकृष्ण दीक्षित ने लिखा है कि अनन्त के दो पुत्र नीलकण्ठ और रामदैवज्ञ थे। रामदैवज्ञ ने मुहूर्तचिन्तामणि में अपने वंशवृत्त का वर्णन किया है। गोविन्द दैवज्ञ ने पीयूषधारा टीका में अपने पिता का नाम नीलकण्ठ निरूपित किया है।&#xA;श्री शंकर बालकृष्ण दीक्षित, म०म० पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी तथा आचार्य नेमिचन्द्र शास्त्री आचार्य नीलकण्ठ के जन्म संवत् के बारे में सामान्यतः कुछ मतभेद व्यक्त करते हैं, परन्तु उनका काल अकबर के शासन काल से कई अंशों में समानान्तर बैठता है। &amp;lsquo;नीलकण्ठी&amp;rsquo; के हिन्दी टीकाकार श्री केदारदत्त जोशी भी आचार्य नीलकण्ठ को अकबर बादशाह के सभा में पण्डित होना स्वीकार करते हैं।&#xA;म्लेच्छा हि यवनास्तेषु सम्यक् शास्त्रमिदं स्थितम्। ऋषिवत्तेऽपि पूज्यन्ते किं पुनर्दैवविद्-द्विजाः।।।&#xA;१. श्री गर्गान्वयभूषणं गणितविच्चिन्तामणिस्तत्सुतो- नन्तोऽनन्तमतिर्व्यधात्खलमतध्वस्त्यै जनुःपद्धतिम् ।&#xA;(-ताजिक नीलकण्ठी) २. सम्भूतः खलु नीलकण्ठविदुषो गोविन्दनामा सुतः। -पीयूषधारा टीका, उपसंहाराध्याय।२५०&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;आचार्य नीलकण्ठ तथा ज्ञानराज&#xA;२५१&#xA;इस प्रकार के विभिन्न मीमांसा के आधार पर हम देखते हैं, कि आचार्य नीलकण्ठ का जीवन वैदुष्यपूर्ण एवं सम्माननीय था। महान् विद्वान् कुल में उत्पन्न होने का लाभ भी नीलकण्ठ ने उठाया, और यावनी भाषा होने के कारण भी ज्ञान को पवित्र मानते हुए, ताजिक शास्त्र में अमूल्य ग्रन्थ की रचना की। आचार्य ने वर्षतन्त्र पर अति महत्त्वपूर्ण कार्य करके समाज को वार्षिक फलादेश ज्ञान को सरल बनाया। इन्होंने अरबी एवं फारसी ज्योतिष ग्रन्थों के आधार पर &amp;lsquo;ताजिक नीलकण्ठी&amp;rsquo; नामक गन्थ की रचना की।&#xA;इनके ग्रन्थ को देखने पर यह पता चलता है, कि इन्होंने गणित शास्त्र के साथ ही फलित शास्त्र में भी प्रवीणता ग्रहण की। आज ताजिक नीलकण्ठी इतना सम्पूर्ण ग्रन्थ ताजिक शास्त्र के इतिहास में दूसरा नहीं हैं। गोविन्द दैवज्ञ के कथनानुसार आचार्य नीलकण्ठ मीमांसा एवं सांख्य शास्त्र के भी विद्वान थे और अकबर के राजसभा में पण्डितेन्द्र भी थे।&#xA;या की।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. विनोद राव पाठक&#xA;काशी नगरी के धार्मिक, सांस्कृतिक एवं भौगोलिक महत्व उसका विद्या की उपासना स्थली होना हैं। पौराणिक मान्यताओं के अनुसार उपनिषत् काल से ही ज्ञान पिपासु-मनीषी काशी आकर अपनी ज्ञानतृषा शान्त करते हैं। यह परम्परा आज भी अविच्छिन हैं। इसी परम्परा के अभिन्न अङ्ग एक ऐसे महामनीषी, जिन्होंने महाराष्ट्र प्रदेश की कोकणभूमि से काशी आकर अपने ज्ञान को इतना परिमार्जित एवं समृद्ध किया कि उन्हें काशी के विद्वत् समुदाय में मूर्धन्य पद प्राप्त हुआ तथा उनके वैदुष्य की प्रभा सम्पूर्ण भूमण्डल पर उद्भासित हुयी। ये महामनीषी थे महामहोपाध्याय पं० बापूदेव शास्त्री सी० आई० ई०।&#xA;२५४&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड है, जिसके अन्तर्गत बहुत सारे यन्त्रों की कल्पना स्वयं ज्ञानराज ने की है और उसका व्यवहार भी बताया है। ग्रन्थावलोकन से यह प्राप्त होता है कि इन्होंने बहुत स्थलों पर पुराण के मतों का मण्डन करते हुए सौरपक्ष के विरुद्ध पक्षों का खण्डन भी किया है। इसमें भास्कर के मत शामिल हैं। उन्होंने सूर्यसिद्धान्त में बीजसंस्कार करके उसको सामयिक बना दिया। आचार्य लोकमणि दाहाल ने लिखा है कि सिद्धान्तसुन्दर नामक ग्रन्थ की कोई प्रधान विशेषता नहीं दिखाई देती केवल बीजाधान ही महत्त्वपूर्ण हैं। इस ग्रन्थ में करण ग्रन्थ की तरह क्षेपक और वर्ष गतियाँ पढ़ी गई हैं। अयनांश का उल्लेख कहीं भी ग्रन्थ में ज्ञानराज ने नहीं किया हैं परन्तु अयनांश के बारे में लिखा है कि, मध्याह्नछाया द्वारा लाया गया रवि और करणागत स्पष्ट रवि का अन्तर ही अयनांश है। चन्द्रकला के क्षय वृद्धि प्रसंग में उन्होंने लिखा है कि वेदों में सूर्य किरणों को ही देवता कहते हैं जो शुक्ल एवं कृष्ण पक्ष में कलायें देती रहती है। पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी ने लिखा है कि आचार्य ज्ञानराज ने कहीं-कहीं उचित कल्पना की है, परन्तु कहीं-कहीं युक्तिशून्य भी लगता है जो, गोलज्ञान से बहिर्भूत दिखता है। इस प्रकार हम कह सकते हैं कि सिद्धान्तसुन्दर ग्रन्थ अपने नाम जैसा ही सुन्दर ग्रन्थ है जिसके सुन्दर पद्य एवं शैली तथा छन्द पाठकों को प्रभावित करते रहते हैं।&#xA;सिद्धान्तसुन्दर ग्रन्थ के ऊपर ज्ञानराज के वंशज चिन्तामणि ने टीका की है, जो बहुत महत्त्वपूर्ण माना जाता है।&#xA;पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी ने लिखा है कि ज्ञानराज द्वारा रचित बीजगणित भी है जो, भास्करीय बीज की छायानुरूप हैं। जहाँ भास्करीय “सरूपके वर्णकृती तु यत्रेति&amp;quot; सूत्र का खण्डन किया गया हैं। ११ सूर्य ने भास्करीय बीजभाष्य में लिखा है कि ज्ञानराज ने सिद्धान्तसुन्दर के अतिरिक्त जातक, साहित्य और सङ्गीत विषयक ग्रन्थ भी बनाये हैं&#xA;सरस्वती भवन के पाण्डुलिपि संग्रह में निम्न ग्रन्थ पूर्णापूर्ण रूप में पाये जाते हैं। १. सिद्धान्तसुन्दर क्र०सं० ३४६७०। २. सिद्धान्तसुन्दरीय बीजम्-क्र०सं० ३५६२६ (अपूर्ण) लिपिकाल-१६७२। ३. सुन्दर सिद्धान्त, क्र०सं० ३६६०६ अपूर्ण।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As concerns the removing of the Pole star, the most drastic version is told by the Lapps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Arcturus (alpha Bootis, supposed to be an archer, Ursa Major being his bow) shoots down the North Nail with his arrow on the last day, the heaven will fall, crushing the earth and setting fire to everything. [1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other legends prefer to deal with the fate of circumpolar stars, the result being the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XV — The Waters from the Deep&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The glacier knocks in the cup-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;board,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The desert sighs in the bed,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the crack in the tea cup&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;opens&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lane to the land of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;W. H. AUDEN, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;As I Walked&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out One Evening&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THERE IS A TRADITION from Borneo of a &amp;ldquo;Whirlpool island&amp;rdquo; with a tree that allows a man to climb up into heaven and bring back useful seeds from the &amp;ldquo;land of the Pleiades.&amp;rdquo; [1]  The Polynesians have not made up their mind, apparently, concerning the exact localization of their whirlpool which serves in most cases as entrance to the abode of the dead; it is supposed to be found &amp;ldquo;at the end of the sky,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;at the edge of the Milky Way.&amp;rdquo; [2]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. विनोदराव पाठक&#xA;पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी का जन्म सन् १८६० में काशी के निकट स्थित खजुरी नामक ग्राम में हुआ था। इनके पूर्वज मूलतः गोरखपुर के निवासी थे। प्रपितामह दत्तकपुत्र के रूप में अपने धनसम्पन्न मातामह (नाना) के घर रहने लगे थे सुधाकर जी के जन्म के समय इनके परिवार में पितामह की छत्रछाया में चार पितृव्य तथा अनेक भाई बन्धु संयुक्त रुप से रहते थे। फलतः जन-धन एवं ज्ञान से सम्पन्न परिवार में सुधाकर का लालन-पालन बड़े स्नेह से होने लगा। दुर्भाग्य से नौ मास की अवस्था में ही मातृवियोग के कारण सुधाकर जी ने दादा-दादी के संरक्षण में बाल्यावस्था व्यतीत की। समृद्ध परिवार के लालित पुत्र होने के कारण सात वर्ष की अवस्था तक इनका अक्षरारम्भ नहीं हो सका। आठवें वर्ष घर पर ही अक्षरज्ञान कराकर पिता ने ज्योतिष पढ़ने के लिए गवर्नमेन्ट संस्कृत कालेज में इन्हें प्रविष्ट करा दिया। पिता यजमानी वृत्ति करते थे। उनका उद्देश्य केवल यही था कि पुत्र सामान्य ज्योतिष तथा कर्मकाण्ड में निपुण हो जाय।&#xA;कालेज में सुधाकर जी ने पं० दुर्गादत्त शास्त्री से व्याकरण पढ़ना आरम्भ किया। पिताजी ने उन्हें ज्योतिष पढ़ने का निर्देश दिया तथा स्वयं कालेज ले जाकर ज्योतिष कक्ष में जाकर पढ़ने का संकेत किया। ज्योतिष कक्ष में पं० बापूदेव शास्त्री तथा पं० देव कृष्ण मिश्र आमने-सामने बैठ कर पढ़ाते थे। सुधाकर देवकृष्ण जी के पास जाकर पढ़ने लगे। दो-तीन दिन बाद चर्चावश पिता को ज्ञात हुआ कि बालक बापूदेव शास्त्री से न पढ़कर देवकृष्ण जी से पढ़ता है तो वे अत्यन्त क्रद्ध हुये और उसे बापू देव जी से पढ़ने का निर्देश दिया। किन्तु किशोर सुधाकर ने बड़ी दृढ़ता से उत्तर दिया-“गुरु मान कर जिसके समक्ष पोथी खोली है उसके प्रति अश्रद्धा व्यक्त करना शास्त्र विरुद्ध होगा। मैं ने जिन्हें गुरु मान लिया है उन से ही यथार्थ ज्ञान प्राप्त होगा। अतः मैं उन्ही से पढूँगा।&amp;quot; इसके बाद सुधाकर जी ने सम्पूर्ण ज्योतिष का अध्ययन पं० देवकृष्ण जी से ही किया जब कि बापूदेव शास्त्री उस समय के सबसे श्रेष्ठ गणितज्ञ थे।&#xA;कुछ दिन बाद एक अविस्मरणीय तथा रोचक घटना हुयी जो सुधाकर जी की गणितीय ऋतम्भरा प्रतिभा को व्यक्त करती है। म०म० बापूदेव शास्त्री ने स्वरचित पुस्तक बीजगणित प्रथम भाग की एक प्रति अपने सहायक श्रीदेवकृष्ण जी को भेंट की। उस पुस्तक को सुधाकर जी पढ़ने के लिये माँग कर घर ले गये। उन्होंने रात्रि में बड़े मनोयोग से उसका अध्ययन कर अनेक गणित सम्बन्धी अशुद्धियाँ निकाली तथा उनका संशोधन भी लाल स्याही से पुस्तक पर ही कर दिया। दूसरे दिन जब उन्होंने वे अशुद्धियाँ तथा संशोधन गुरुजी को दिखाये तो देवकृष्ण जी अपने शिष्य की इस “छोटे मुँह बड़ी बात&amp;quot; को जान कर हतप्रभ तथा भयभीत हो गये।&#xA;महामहोपाध्याय सुधाकर द्विवेदी&#xA;२६३ बापूदेव शास्त्री तत्कालीन सर्वश्रेष्ठ गणितज्ञ माने जाते थे, उनकी पुस्तक में अशुद्धि निकालना एक बहुत बड़ी धृष्टता थी। देवकृष्ण जी ने सुधाकर को चुप रहने का संकेत कर चर्चा बदलनी चाही किन्तु उसी कक्ष में दूसरी और बैठे बापूदेव जी गुरु शिष्य की फुसफुसाहट सुन रहे थे। उन्होंने जिज्ञासा की तो देवकृष्ण जी कुछ छिपा न सके, अपने शिष्य की इस &amp;lsquo;प्रातिभ-उद्दण्डता&amp;rsquo; को गुरु जी को बता दिया। विशालहृदय गुणैकपक्षपाती पं० बापूदेव जी उस संशोधन को देखकर बड़े प्रसन्न हुये। उन्होंने प्रिन्सिपल को सुधाकर के विषय में एक प्रशंसा पत्र लिखा-“अयं सुधाकर शर्मा गणिते बृहस्पतिसमः&amp;quot; तथा उन्हें पारितोषिक देने की संस्तति भी की। फलतः सधाकर जी को अनेक पारितोषिक प्राप्य हये, उनकी ख्याति भी चारों ओर हो गयी। सुधाकर जी इस घटना को अपने जीवन की सबसे महत्वपूर्ण घटना मानते थे। उनके अनुसार इस घटना के बाद उत्पन्न हुये आत्मविश्वास ने ही उन्हें गणित के गम्भीर अध्ययन के लिए प्रेरित किया था।&#xA;सुधाकर जी छात्रावस्था से ही अध्ययन के साथ अध्यापन के लिये भी उत्सुक रहा करते थे। अध्ययन समाप्त होते ही उनके कछ मैथिल छात्रों के कहने पर मिथिला नरेश ने उन्हें काशीस्थ &amp;lsquo;दरभंगा सं० पाठशाला&amp;rsquo; में प्रधानाध्यापक बना दिया। कुछ दिन बाद डॉ० ग्रिफिथ के अवकाश लेने के बाद डॉ० थीबो गवर्नमेन्ट कालेज में प्रिन्सिपल नियुक्त हुये। ये गणित के प्रकाण्ड विद्वान थे। इन्होंने सुधाकर जी की विद्वता से प्रभावित होकर उन्हें &amp;lsquo;सरस्वती भवन पुस्तकालय&amp;rsquo; का अध्यक्ष नियुक्त कर दिया। सुधाकर जी ने इस पद पर रहते हुये वहाँ संगृहीत हस्तलिखित ग्रन्थों का गम्भीर अध्ययन किया। छह वर्ष बाद पं० बापूदेव शास्त्री के अवकाश ग्रहण करने पर रिक्त हुये ज्योतिष विभागाध्यक्ष पद पर सुधाकर जी को प्रतिष्ठित कर दिया गया। केवल २६ वर्ष की अवस्था में उक्त महनीय पद को प्राप्त करने वाले सुधाकर जी ने उस पद को इक्कीस वर्षों तक सुशोभित किया। इस कालमें द्विवेदी ने अनेक शिष्यों को गणितशास्त्र में पारंगत बनाने के साथ अनेक मौलिक ग्रन्थों का प्रणयन तथा दुरूह प्राच्य ज्योतिष ग्रन्थों का सम्पादन कर प्रभूत यश अर्जित किया। २८ नवम्बर १६१० ई० को केवल ५० वर्ष की आयु में ही पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी अपने पीछे भरा-पूरा परिवार छोड़कर गोलोकवासी हो गये।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XVI — The Stone and the Tree&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A stately pleasure dome decree&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where Alph, the sacred river, ran&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through caverns measureless to man&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Down to a sunless sea&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;COLERIDGE, &lt;em&gt;Kubla Khan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE GROUND, indeed, is not only sensitive but difficult and shifting as well. If the whirlpool turns up in the theory of the Cross, it is certainly without the consent of theologians. Yet the instances so far given are not isolated ones. It is necessary to deal with material which may appear suspicious to the trained historical reader, who is bound to be wary of &lt;em&gt;omne ignotum pro magnifico&lt;/em&gt;. One should, therefore, preface this chapter with a small case history, which may show the infrangible tenacity of certain kinds of transmitted material, fragments of a sort official memory is prone to dismiss or neglect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. सच्चिदानन्द मिश्र&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;१-कल-वधयक-परतयकष-वदय&#34;&gt;१. काल विधायक प्रत्यक्ष विद्या&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ज्योतिष से कालचक्र समस्त दृश्यादृश्य विश्व, खगोलीय ज्योतिषपिण्ड, पिण्डाण्डीय संस्थान, मान, संचार, संरचना आदि तथ्य जुड़े हैं। काल एवं पिण्डाण्डों का सापेक्षिक प्रभाव, मानव तथा विश्व एवं समस्त विश्वाभिप्रायिक त्रिगोलीय प्रभाव निरूपक यह शास्त्र त्रिस्कन्धात्मक ज्यौतिष है। वेद एवं वैदिक दर्शन अनादि अनन्त सीमाहीन अव्यक्त-महाकाल एवं सीमाहीन महाकाश में सृष्टिचक्र को पर्ययात्मक मानता है। यह चक्र भी अनवरत संरचरणशील तथा परिवर्तनशील है। कालान्तर एवं क्षेत्रान्तर जन्य निष्पत्ति व्यक्त सापेक्षिक काल तथा ग्रहह्म पिण्डों के आधार पर व्यक्त होते हैं। अन्यथा पिण्डहीन महाकाश में महाकाल भी तदन्तर्भुक्त होता है। विभिन्न पिण्डाण्डीय सापेक्षता से उत्पन्न व्यक्त काल भूत, वर्त्तमान एवं भविष्य का विभाग प्रस्तुत करता है। काल को सभी का पाचक, सृष्टि स्थिति एवं संहार का मूल माना जाता हैं।&#xA;२६८&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड सवैया तथा कवित्त लिखते थे। उनको सामान्य हिन्दी ही मान्य थी, संस्कृत निष्ठ तथा ऊर्दू मिश्रित हिन्दी के वे विरोधी थे। उनके हिन्दी-प्रेम की एक घटना विख्यात हैं।&#xA;सन् १८६८-६६ में न्यायालयों में नागरी लिपि को मान्यता दिलाने के लिये मालवीय जी के नेतृत्व में जनान्दोलन चल रहा था। ऊर्दूवालों का यह दावा था कि न्यायालयीय विषयवस्तु जितनी स्पष्ट और शीघ्रता से ऊर्दू में लिखी जा सकती है उतनी हिन्दी में नहीं। इस चुनौती को हिन्दी समर्थकों को ओर से पं० द्विवेदी ने स्वीकार किया। जिलाधिकारी ने निश्चित किया कि दोनों लिपियों के एक-एक लेखक मेरे द्वारा दिये गये वक्तव्य को लिखेंगे, जिसका लेखन हर तरह से शुद्ध होगा वह विजयी माना जायेगा।&#xA;नागरी में लिखने के लिये पं० द्विवेदी जी उपस्थित हुये। जिलाधिकारी समुचितगति से बोलने लगे तथा दोनों लेखक लिखने लगे। लेखन समाप्त होते ही द्विवेदी जी ने यथावत् पढ़कर सुना दिया। उसमें एक भी वर्तनी या वाक्यात्मक अशुद्धि नहीं थी। ऊर्दू वाले अटक-अटक कर पढ़ने लगे। उनके लेख में अनेक अशुद्धियाँ तथा छूटे थी। जनकोलाहल के बीच द्विवेदी जी विजयी हुये। अधिकारियों का सन्देह निवृत्त हो गया। उ०प्र० के शासक सर एण्टनी मैकडोनल के समय में अदालती काम-काजों में नागरी लिपि को मान्यता दे दी गयी। नागरी की इस विजय का श्रेय शीघ्र, स्वच्छ तथा शुद्ध लेखन के महारथी पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी को जाता हैं।&#xA;आधुनिक ज्योतिष शास्त्र के इतिहास में म०म०पं० सुधाकर द्विवेदी का नाम सिद्धान्त ज्योतिष के उन्नायक के रूप में सदा अमर रहेगा। उन्होंने ज्योतिष शास्त्र के लुप्तप्राय प्राचीन ग्रन्थों को प्रकाश में लाकर तथा अपनी व्याख्या, भाष्य एवं उपपत्तियों से सुबोध बनाकर, अपनी ऋतंभरा प्रतिभा का जो चमत्कार दिखलाया है वह अभूतपूर्व तथा विद्वानों को आश्चर्य में डाल देने वाला है। साथ ही हिन्दी भाषा तथा साहित्य के संरक्षण तथा उन्नयन के लिये उनके द्वारा जो कार्य किये गये हैं वे भी अत्यन्त उपादेय तथा आदरणीय हैं। उनके विषय में महान् ज्योतिर्विद् पद्मभूषण पं० सूर्यनारायण व्यास की निम्नांकित उक्ति अक्षरशः सत्य हैं-&amp;ldquo;ज्योतिविद्या के सम्बर्धन में पं० सुधाकर जी ने जो कार्य किया हैं वह असाधारण हैं। गणेश दैवज्ञ के बाद ३०० वर्षों में सुधाकर जी को छोड़कर कोई ऐसा कृती-शूर-मनीषी नहीं हुआ जिसने इस शास्त्र की इतनी सेवा की हो। सुधाकर जी ने ज्योतिषविद्या को सप्राण और समृद्ध बनाया। यद्यपि म०म० बापूदेव शास्त्री ने इस दृष्टि कोण का प्रवर्तन किया था किन्तु इसे पल्लवित, प्रथित और सुरक्षित सुधाकर जी ने ही किया। सुधाकर जी इस देश की विद्वद्विभूति थे। बहुमुखी प्रतिभा तथा पाण्डित्य के धनी&#xA;थे। उन्होंने भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्र की गरिमा से विश्व को परिचित कराया।&amp;rdquo;&#xA;विज्ञानवीथीपथिकैरुपास्यः सिद्धान्तसिंहासनसार्वभौमः। प्राचीप्रतीचीगणितज्ञवन्द्यः सुधाकरोऽयं महनीयकीर्तिः।&#xA;कालः पचति भूतानि सर्वाण्येव सहात्मना।&#xA;अन्ते स पक्वस्तेनैव सहाव्यक्ते लयं व्रजेत् ।। अर्थात् काल समस्त भूतों का पाचक है। परम अव्यक्त से ही समस्त व्यक्त उत्पन्न होते हैं। ब्राह्मदिनादि में सृष्टि तथा दिनान्त में लय का सिद्धान्त यहां प्रतिपादित है। अव्यक्त से क्रमानुरोध से एक कालावच्छेदेन समस्त सृष्टि निःसरित होती है तथा एक साथ लय को प्राप्त होती है। उत्पत्ति से परम विकास तथा ह्रासानुरोध से विनाश तक व्यक्त विश्व व्यष्टि एवं समष्टि दोनों भेदों को दर्शाता हैं।&#xA;संहिता स्कन्ध -दिव्य, नाभस तथा भौम प्रभावों का सर्वविश्वाभिप्रयिक निरूपक विधान संहिता स्कन्ध अनेक दृष्टि से सर्वाधिक महत्वपूर्ण ज्यौतिषाङ्ग है। इस के अनेक विद्याविभाग आज भी उपलब्ध हैं। दिव्य, नाभस तथा भौम ये तीन मुख्य प्रभाव भेद दर्शक हैं।&#xA;ज्यौतिष शास्त्र में संहिता स्कन्ध का उद्भव विकास एवं स्थिति-संहिता स्कन्ध का मूल ऋग्वेद में ही विद्यमान है। ऋग्वेद से नवीनतम विकास तक की यात्रा काफी लम्बी है। इस मध्य विकास तथा हास के अनेक दौर गुजर गये। वैदिक सभ्यता के साथ अन्य सभ्यताओं में भी ज्यौतिष संहिता स्कन्ध का प्रयोग होता था।&#xA;वैदिकज्यौतिष तथा मध्यकालीन सिद्धान्तों का अनुशीलन कर भारतीय ज्योतिष मराठी में श्री बालकृष्ण दीक्षित की अद्वितीय कृति है। इसमें वैदिक, बेबीलोन, ग्रीक तथा२७०&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड चीन आदि की सभ्यताओं में ज्योतिष के अस्तित्व एवं स्वरूप पर श्री दीक्षित का अन्वेषणं एवं संकलन स्तुत्य प्रयास रहा है। वैदिक ज्यौतिष इस विद्या के पूर्वसामयिक परम विकास को दर्शाता है। वैदिक ज्यौतिष से वेदाङ्ग ज्योतिष तक का प्रवर्तन तथा प्रायोगिक-विकास लगध आर्यभट वराह आदि आचार्यो के माध्यम से हुआ है। संहिता की दृष्टि से बृहत्संहिता वैदिक मूलसंहिताओं, ब्राह्मणों अरण्यकों पुराणों में भी अनेक संहिता स्कन्धीय सिद्धान्त मिलते हैं। श्री दीक्षित का अन्वेषण वेदाङ्ग ज्यौतिष से जयसिंह तक की यथार्थ समीक्षा हैं। भारत की तरह अन्य देशों में भी ज्यौतिष शास्त्रीय अन्वेषण इस विद्या के सार्वदेशिक रूप को व्यक्त करता है। वैदिक संहिता तथा ब्राह्मण ज्यौतिष शास्त्रीय मूल ग्रन्थ न होने पर भी प्रसंगानुरोध से मन्त्रात्मक शैली में उच्चतम ज्यौतिष शास्त्रीय सिद्धान्तों का वर्णन प्रस्तुत किये हैं। यजुर्वेदीय प्रमाण “प्रज्ञानाय नक्षत्र दर्शनम्। यादसे गणकम्” से ज्योतिर्विद् का&#xA;स्वतन्त्र महत्व प्रकट होता हैं।&#xA;सूत्रकाल तथा वेदाङ्काल में स्वतन्त्र ग्रन्थ प्रणयन की प्रक्रिया तथा संहितोक्त मन्त्रों का ब्राह्मणों में प्रयोगात्मक रूप मिलते है। ज्योतिषशास्त्रीय समस्त मूल तथ्य वैदिक वाङ्मय में उपलब्ध हैं। अष्टादश ज्योतिष शास्त्र प्रवर्तकों (ब्राह्मादिक सूर्यादि) के मूल ग्रन्थ आज नहीं मिलते, फलतः क्रमिक विकास की समीक्षा यथार्थ रूप में करना संभव नहीं हैं। वेदाङ्गकाल से आज तक का विकास क्रम स्पष्ट है। ऋषि मुनियों सिद्ध योगियों के बाद सिद्ध तान्त्रिकों के कालखण्ड एवं तत्पश्चात् पौरुष ग्रन्थकारों के कालखण्डों की अनेक कड़ियों को जोड़ने हेतु व्यापक अन्वेषण के महत्व को नकारा नहीं जा सकता। _आदिकालीन सिद्धान्त मध्यकालीन सिद्धान्त तथा संहिता प्रयोगात्मक हैं। परन्तु वैदिक ज्यौतिष के उत्कर्ष के आख्यानात्मक रूप को देखने पर पता चलता है, कि सिद्धान्तकालीन ज्यौतिष तथ्य काफी पीछे हैं। महाभारत से वेदाङ्गकाल तक का क्रम स्पष्ट नहीं। क्योंकि वैदिक ज्यौतिष सिद्धान्त कैसे व्यवहार बाह्य हुये तथा अष्टादश ज्यौतिष शास्त्र प्रवर्तकों के ग्रन्थ कैसे लुप्त हुए ये सब अन्वेषण योग्य तथ्य हैं।&#xA;वेदाङ्काल में पूर्ववर्ती त्रिस्कन्धात्मक सिद्धान्तों को संग्रहीत कर पूर्व ऋषि के नाम पर स्वतन्त्र ग्रन्थ अवश्य बनें। महाभारतादि ऐतिहासिक महाकाव्यों में भी त्रिस्कन्धात्मक ज्यौतिषसिद्धान्त बिखरे पड़े हैं। तैत्तरीय संहिता, तैत्तरीय ब्राह्मण तथा अर्थर्ववेदीय नक्षत्रकल्प त्रिस्कन्धात्मक ज्योतिष के महत्व एवं दिव्य विस्तार को प्रकट करते हैं। वैदिक संहिता तथा ब्राह्मणकाल में ज्यौतिष विज्ञान कितना विकसित था, इसका निर्धारण अभी तक नहीं हो सका है, क्योंकि अनेक उच्चतम अन्वेषण-गम्य तथ्य जो आख्यानात्मक रूप में वैदिक संहितादि में मिलते हैं, वहाँ तक पहुँचने में अभी हमें कितने शताब्दी तक संघीय अन्वेषण पूर्ण करने होंगे, यह कहा नहीं जा सकता। पौरुषग्रन्थ क्रम वेदाङ्गकाल से प्रारम्भ हुआ। इसका विवरण बृहत्संहिता में मिलता है। उससे पूर्व ऋषियों एवं मुनियों के द्वारा प्रणीत ग्रन्थ&#xA;संहितास्कन्ध&#xA;२७१ प्रचलित थे। बृहत् संहिता में पूर्व संहिताकारों के नाम स्पष्टतः वर्णित हैं, जिनके मूल संहिता ग्रन्थ अब नहीं मिलते।&#xA;_ योगयात्रा-संहिता स्कन्धान्तर्गत मुहूर्त विषयक रचना है। बृहज्जातक में प्राचीन जातककारों के नाम मिलते हैं। वराह के समय वेध परम्परा एवं शास्त्रीय संगठन की प्रक्रिया नये सिरे से प्रारम्भ होने के कारण अच्छी थी, इसमें सन्देह नहीं। आर्यभट्ट, वराह, लल्ल, ब्रह्मगुप्त, श्रीपति, भोजराज, भास्कर तथा बल्लालसेन तक भारतीय ज्यौतिष का क्रमिक विकासक्रम स्पष्ट है। तत्पश्चात् गणेश के क्रम से मुनीश्वर कमलाकर, जयसिंह तक विभिन्नबाधा के मध्य में भी विकास क्रम चलता रहा। फिर अंग्रेजी कालखण्ड में भी नीलाम्बर, कृष्णदत्त, बापूदेव, लोकमान्य तिलक, सुधाकर केतकर, चुलैट, एन०सी० लाहरी, मेघनाथशाहा दीक्षित, गोरखप्रसाद, सोमयाजी आदि का अन्वेषण हमें प्राप्त होता है। गणेश से बापूदेव तक ज्यौतिष सिद्धान्त में पञ्चाङ्ग तक भारतीय अन्वेषणधारा सीमित रही। नवीन वैज्ञानिक विकास के साथ भारतीय ज्यौतिष संहितास्कन्ध के पाञ्चभौतिक सापेक्षिक विद्याओं का उदघाटन फिर से संभव हो रहा हैं।&#xA;बल्लालसेन के पश्चात् अवरुद्ध संहितोक्त अन्वेषणक्रम में कुछ अधिक नहीं हो सका। ज्योतिर्निबन्ध, दैवज्ञ कामधेनु तथा बृहदैवज्ञरञ्जन, मयूरचित्रक, प्रभृति रचित ग्रन्थ भी बल्लालसेन से आगे नहीं जा सके। क्रमिक अन्वेषणाभाव में समयबद्ध प्रगति रुक जाने से अनेक प्राचीन अन्वेषण प्रयोग-बाह्य होते गये। म०म० सुधाकर द्विवेदी द्वारा पुनर्जागरणकाल में बृहत्संहिता का भट्टोत्पलीटीका सहित प्रकाशित कराने के बाद फिर से संहितोक्त गौरव&#xA;का अहसास हम कर रहे हैं। __ अद्भुतसागर का प्रकाशन पं० श्री मुरलीधर झा के अन्वेषण से १६०५ ई० में सम्भव हो सका। अन्वेषणावरोध से अनेक सिद्धान्तों की उत्पत्ति तथा मूल समझना कठिन हो गया है &amp;lsquo;लेकिन प्राचीन ऋषियों के विद्याओं को नवीन अन्वेषण पद्धति से तथा आध्यात्मिक पद्धति से जोड़ दिया जाए तो व्यवहार-बाह्यों को फिर से व्यवहार-गम्य बनाया जा सकेगा।&#xA;भारतीय त्रिस्कन्धात्मक ज्योतिष गणित, गोल पञ्चमहाभूत, एवं त्रिगुणात्मक विभाग, गोलीययन्त्र तथा गोलीय वेध से सम्बद्ध है। इसकी हर शाखा पूर्ण वैज्ञानिक है। नवीन वैज्ञानिक विकास का मूल भी त्रिस्कन्ध ज्यौतिष है। इसके अनेक प्रबल प्राचीन तथा नवीन प्रमाण प्राप्त हैं। परन्तु संहितोक्त कुछ विद्याएँ दिव्य होने से आज भी अन्वेषणान्तर्गत नहीं किये जा सके। भारतीय वैदिक वाङ्मय योगनिष्ठ मन्त्र, तन्त्र एवं यन्त्राश्रित विज्ञानों का&#xA;समन्वित रूप होने पर भी उपेक्षित होता गया। (१) मन्त्रात्मक विज्ञान- वैदिक संहिता तथा तन्त्रागम ध्वनिविज्ञान एवं ज्योतिर्विद्या का&#xA;.. परमोत्कर्ष रूप अपरिवर्तनीय माना गया है।&#xA;२७३&#xA;२७२&#xA;संहितास्कन्ध&#xA;V..&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड (२) अमन्त्रात्मक विद्या- इसमें अर्थ भाव तथा पाञ्चभौतिक प्रयोगात्मक विधान आते हैं।&#xA;इसमें शब्द प्रधान नहीं है। एक अर्थ तथा भाव को अनेक शाब्दिक माध्यमों से व्यक्त किये जा सकते हैं।&#xA;बृहत्संहिता में जिन-जिन संहिताकारों के विवरण मिलते हैं, उनके मूल ग्रन्थ आज नहीं मिलते। वराह से बल्लाल सेन तक जिन संहितोक्त विद्याओं के समावेश है, उनमें परवर्ती काल में मुहूर्त को छोड़कर अन्य शाखाएँ गौण तथा संघसाध्य विद्या शाखाएँ प्रयोग बाह्य होती गयीं। सूक्ष्म निरयण तथा सायण पद्धति के समन्वय पर आधारित द्विविध गणनाश्रित सूक्ष्मनिरयण पञ्चाङ्ग भी अन्वेषणाभाव में उत्तरोत्तर स्थूल होते गये।&#xA;_ जहाँ गुरुत्वाकर्षण सिद्धान्त तथा दूरदर्शक के आविष्कार के पश्चात् उत्तरोत्तर विकास . रूप नवीन खगोलशास्त्र भू-भौतिकी खगोलभौतिकी ज्यौतिष की सीमा में प्रविष्ट है, वहाँ&#xA;स्वतन्त्रता के बाद भी नवीन खगोल शास्त्रीय सम्बद्धता से जोड़कर संहितोक्त विद्याओं के विकासार्थ संघीय प्रयत्न न के बराबर हुए।&#xA;त्रिस्कन्ध ज्यौतिष की सीमा को हम वेदाङ्गकाल से ग्रहण वर्गीकरण प्रस्तुत करते हैं, जब कि वैदिक ज्यौतिष मूल से सम्बद्ध होने पर भी वेदाङ्ग ज्यौतिष काफी पीछे है। त्रिस्कन्ध ज्यौतिष सम्बद्ध अनेक शाखाएँ नवीन विकास के अन्तर्गत पूर्ण वैज्ञानिक पद्धतियां बन गयी तथा बन रही हैं। वैदिकवाङ्मय से प्रारम्भ कर इस यान्त्रिक युग तक में प्रवेश का इतिहास अनेकों उत्थान तथा पतन के बाद फिर से उत्थान का संकेत देता है। सभी देश तथा काल में ज्योतिर्विद्या का अस्तित्व इसके सार्वकालिक तथा सार्वदेशिक विशिष्ट स्वरूप को दर्शाता है। त्रिस्कन्ध ज्यौतिष का विस्तार एवं संहितोक्त विज्ञानवाद भारतीय ज्यौतिष के वैशिष्ट्य को आज भी सिद्ध करता है। प्राचीन ऋषियों के सिद्धनिष्कर्ष आज भी काफी महत्वपूर्ण हैं।&#xA;संहिता स्कन्ध-आज संहिता स्कन्ध की अनेक शाखाएँ पाश्चात्य भारतीय अन्वेषण से विज्ञान का रूप धारण कर चुकी हैं परन्तु दुर्भाग्य से भारत में समन्वयात्मक पद्धति उत्तरोत्तर उपेक्षित होती गयी। शतपथ तथा गोपथ ब्राह्मण की परम्परा अन्तिम वैदिक वैज्ञानिक परम्परा थी। वराह के वर्णनानुसार सृष्ट्यारम्भ कालिक कश्यप से प्रारम्भ कर समास संहिता तक की चर्चा विशिष्ट विस्तृत परम्परा का संकेत देता है। वराह से बल्लाल सेन तक ७०० वर्षों का अन्तर है। ११००+७०० = १८०० शकाब्द के बाद भारतीय मूल ज्ञान पाश्चात्य माध्यम से फिर प्रकट हो रहा है, वहाँ संहितोक्त प्रयोग धाराएँ क्षीण होते-होते&#xA;आख्यानों तथा ग्रन्थों तक संकुचित हो गयी हैं।&#xA;संहिता स्कन्ध का विस्तार-१. दिव्यभाग, २. नाभसभाग, ३. भौमभाग एवं त्रिगोलीय विश्वव्यापी ४. योगज प्रभाव ५. शुभशकुन-कालप्रभावावगमक सर्वविधपार्थिव लक्षणशास्त्र। (यह भी मूल रुप से संहिता का भाग हैं।) इसमें काल, वातावरण, पशुपक्षी&#xA;आदि के चेष्टा के आधार पर विभिन्न शुभाशुभ प्रभाव निर्धारित किये जाते हैं।&#xA;६. केरली तन्त्र-द्वादश मात्रायुक्त कवर्गादि, पञ्चभूत स्वरसंचार, अङ्गो का वैशिष्टय, चेष्टा कालखण्ड, प्रश्नभेद, पात्र की स्थिति आदि के आधार पर शुभ शकुनादि युक्त यह प्रश्न तन्त्र हैं। जीव, वनस्पति आदि का सम्यक् प्रकृति एवं लक्षण ज्ञान इसका पूरक विषय है। यह भाग भी संहिता का अंग हैं। बृहत्संहिता में शुभशकुन तथा अन्यत्र केरलीतन्त्र का वर्णन इन दोनों को संहिता का भाग सिद्ध करता हैं। इन दोनों विद्याओं पर केरलप्रश्नरत्न, केरलप्रश्नसंग्रह प्रभृति केरली विद्या तथा शकुन वसन्तराज प्रभृति शकुन ग्रन्थ हैं।&#xA;संहिता-यह स्कन्ध मेदिनीय ज्यौतिषसंज्ञक एवं अत्यधिक विस्तृत हैं। समहितं करोतीति&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;संहिता ज्यौतिष त्रिगोलीय विश्वप्रभाव को दर्शाता है। दिग्देशकाल एवं क्षेत्रांश द्वारा समष्ट्याभिप्रायिक विश्वप्रभाव निरूपक स्कन्ध संहिता स्कन्ध है। नक्षत्र, ग्रह तथा केतु प्रभाव, भौमप्रभाव तथा नाभस प्रभाव इसके मुख्य प्रतिपाद्य हैं। संहितास्कन्ध पर उपलब्ध प्रामाणिक ग्रन्थों में प्रथम भद्रबाहुसंहिता एवं बृहत्संहिता अद्भुत वैज्ञानिक ग्रन्थ हैं। वराह के समय तक (शक० ४२७) उपलब्ध संहिताकारों के नाम बृहत्संहिता में आ गये हैं। काश्यप, नारद, अत्रि, मनु, गर्ग, पराशर, व्यास देवल प्रभृति ऋषियों के प्रमाणों को बृहत्संहिता में संक्षिप्त रूप में संघटित करने का व्यापक प्रयत्न हुआ।&#xA;वराही संहिता में नक्षत्र, ग्रह, केतु दिव्य प्रभाव से गन्धर्व नगर परिवेष, उल्का पातादि नाभस तथा भूकम्प ज्वालामुखी, भूगर्भीय एवं पृष्ठीय प्रभाव तथा प्रभावावगमक सिद्धान्त मौलिक रूप में विद्यमान हैं। वराहकाल में संहितोक्त अधिकांश विद्याएँ प्रयोगान्तर्गत थी। केतुचार में पराशर गर्ग देवल अथर्वण आदि के मतानुरोध से २७ चर्मक्षु दृश्य केतु तथा १००० केतु दृश्य चक्रान्तर्गत यन्त्र दृश्य माने गये। बल्लाल सेन का अद्भुत सागर संहिता स्कन्ध का समतुल्य अद्भुत ग्रन्थ उपलब्ध है। इसमें १०८ केतुओं को नंगी आँखों से दृश्य होना माना हैं।&#xA;वराह के समय से ही मुहूर्त ग्रन्थ ने स्वतन्त्र शाखा का रूप ग्रहण कर लिया। बल्लाल सेन के पश्चात् संहिता स्कन्ध में मुहूर्त ज्यौतिष का प्राधान्य रहा। इसमें एक अहोरात्र को मानक मानकर शुभाशुभ, नक्षत्र, संस्कार, गोचर, विवाह, यात्रा, वास्तु-कूप, तड़ाग, गृहनिर्माण, देवालयारम्भ, प्रभृति विषय मुख्य रूप से कहे गये हैं। बृहत्संहिता में निरूपित विभिन्न वैज्ञानिक शाखाओं पर अन्वेषण क्रम क्षीण होता गया जो बल्लालसेन के बाद व्यवहार बाह्य होता गया। यद्यपि बृहत्संहिता को मूल मानकर बाद में अनेक संहिता ग्रन्थ रचे गये परन्तु अन्वेषणक्रम क्षीण रहा। त्रिगोलीय विश्वप्रभाव का भूगोलाभिप्रायिक स्वरूप दर्शक संहिता अनेक प्रयोगात्मक विद्या प्रभेदों के रूप में मूल रूप में वराह के समय व्यवहारान्तर्गत था।&#xA;२७४&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&#xA;संहितास्कन्ध&#xA;२७५&lt;/p&gt;</description>

[1]  Curwen might point to his enlightened sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are, happily, emerging from that state of blissful ignorance of the subject which made possible such an anachronism as Décamps&amp;rsquo; well-known picture of &amp;ldquo;Samson grinding in the Prison-house,&amp;rdquo; wherein Samson is seen turning a huge mill-stone by means of a long lever like a capstan-bar, after the fashion of the Roman slaves a thousand years later.

In it we find Er the Armenian, who was resurrected from the funeral pyre just before it was kindled, and who describes his travel through the other world (&lt;em&gt;10&lt;/em&gt;.615ff.). He and the group of souls bound for re birth whom he accompanies travel through the other world. They come to &amp;ldquo;a straight shaft of light, like a pillar, stretching from above throughout heaven and earth — and there, at the middle of the light, they saw stretching from heaven the extremities of its chains; for this light binds the heavens, holding together all the revolving firmament like the undergirths of a ship of war. And from the extremities stretched the Spindle of Necessity, by means of which all the circles revolve.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As concerns the escape of Zipacna, compare the distribution map, given by Frobenius (&lt;em&gt;Paideuma 1&lt;/em&gt; [1938], p. 8, map 3 — &amp;ldquo;Der Lausbub im Haus pfeiler&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the whole motif of pillars and houses pulled down, compare Eduard Stucken, &lt;em&gt;Astralmythen&lt;/em&gt; (1896-1907): pp. 73f. for the death of Nebrôd, according to Cedrenus — of Cain, according to Leo Grammaticus Chron. p. 8 (Kain, hōs legei Mōysēs, tēs oikias pesousēs ep&amp;rsquo;auton eteleutēsen); pp. 329f. for the case of Susanowo; p. 348 for Turkish Depe Ghöz; pp. 402f. for Zipacna; there, he also wants to incorporate Job 1.18. Stucken&amp;rsquo;s complete blindness to the mere existence of planets has prevented him from better understanding; thus, he claims for the case of Job 1.18: &amp;ldquo;Auch hier ist die Orion-Gottheit (Satan-Ahriman), welche den Hauseinsturz verursacht, urn die Plejaden-Gottheit (Hiob) zu züchtigen.&amp;rdquo; This blindness is the more astonishing as Stucken has read Eisenmenger&amp;rsquo;s huge opus, &amp;ldquo;Entdecktes Judenthum&amp;rdquo; (1711), where he should have detected the identity (as claimed by rabbinical literature) of the planet Mars  with the serpent in Paradise, with Kain, Esau, Abimelech, Goliath, Sammael, the Scape-Goat, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XVIII — The Galaxy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voie Lactée, soeur lumineuse&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;des blanches rivières de Canaan,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;et des corps blancs de nos amoureuses,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;nageurs morts suivrons nous d&amp;rsquo;ahan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ton cours vers d&amp;rsquo;autres nébuleuses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;APOLLINAIRE,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Chanson du Mal-Aimé&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MEN&amp;rsquo;s SPIRITS were thought to dwell in the Milky Way between incarnations. This conception has been handed down as an Orphic and Pythagorean tradition [1]  fitting into the frame of the migration of the soul. Macrobius, who has provided the broadest report on the matter, has it that souls ascend by way of Capricorn, and then in order to be reborn, descend again through the &amp;ldquo;Gate of Cancer.&amp;rdquo; [2]  Macrobius talks of &lt;em&gt;signs&lt;/em&gt;; the constellations rising at the solstices in his time (and still in ours) were Gemini and Sagittarius: the &amp;ldquo;Gate of Cancer&amp;rdquo; means Gemini. In fact, he states explicitly (&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.12.5) that this &amp;ldquo;Gate&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;where the Zodiac and the Milky Way intersect.&amp;rdquo; Far away, the Mangaians of old (Austral Islands, Polynesia), who kept the precessional clock running instead of switching over to &amp;ldquo;signs,&amp;rdquo; claim that only at the evening of the solstitial days can spirits enter heaven, the inhabitants of the northern parts of the island at one solstice, the dwellers in the south at the other. [3]  This information, giving precisely fixed dates, is more valuable than general statements to the effect that the Polynesians regarded the Milky Way as &amp;ldquo;the road of souls as they pass to the spirit world.&amp;rdquo; [4]  In Polynesian myth, too, souls are not permitted to stay unless they have reached a stage of unstained perfection, which is not likely to occur frequently. Polynesian souls have to return into bodies again, sooner or later. [5]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. रामचन्द्र पाण्डेय&#xA;आचार्य आर्यभट का जन्म शक ३६८ (ई. सन् ४७६) में हुआ था। स्वयं अपने जन्म समय का उल्लेख गणितीय ढंग से करते हुए अपने सुप्रसिद्ध ग्रन्थ आर्यभटीय में लिखा हैं _तीन युगपाद तथा साठ-साठ वर्षों की साठ आवृत्ति होने पर इनकी आयु २३ वर्ष की थी।&amp;rsquo; इस के अनुसार गणना करने पर भी यही परिणाम आता है। यथा-कथन के अनुसार सत्य, त्रेता, द्वापर तीन युग पाद तथा कलि के ६० वर्षों की ६० आवृत्ति अर्थात् (६० x ६०) = ३६०० वर्ष बीत जाने पर आर्यभट की आयु २३ वर्ष की थी। वर्तमान शक १६२६ में कलि के ५१०८ वर्ष बीत चुके हैं। अतः ५१०५-३६००=१५०८ । शक १६२६-१५०५=४२१ शक। अर्थात् शक ४२१ में इनकी आयु २३ वर्ष की थी। इस लिए ४२१-२३=३६८ शक जन्म काल सुनिश्चित होता है।&#xA;उक्त कथन की सार्थकता सिद्ध करते हुए डॉ० गोरख प्रसाद ने लिखा हैं कि कलि संवत् ३५७७ में इनका जन्म हुआ था तथा ग्रहों की गणना हेतु इन्होंने कलि संवत् ३६०० निश्चित किया था, क्योंकि इनके ग्रन्थ में कहीं भी शक, संवत् का उल्लेख नहीं हैं।&#xA;_ इस सन्दर्भ में शंकरबालकृष्ण दीक्षित ने सैद्धान्तिक प्रमाण के आधार पर जन्म समय के औचित्य को प्रतिपादित करते हुए लिखा है कि वर्षमान के आधार पर भी यही जन्मकाल सिद्ध होता है। पञ्चसिद्धान्तिकोक्त वर्षमान ३६५.१५.३१.३० दिनादि है तथा आर्यभट का वर्षमान ३६५.१५.३१.१५ दिनादि है। इस प्रकार दोनों में १५ विपल का अन्तर आता है। यह अन्तर ३६०० वर्षों में १५ घटी तुल्य हो जाता है। मूल पञ्चसिद्धान्तिकोक्त सूर्यसिद्धान्त में कलियुगारम्भ गुरुवार की मध्यरात्रि में माना गया है तथा आर्यभट ने उससे १५ घटी बाद अर्थात शुक्रवार के सूर्योदय से माना है। अतः कलियुग के ३६०० वर्ष बीत जाने पर, शक ४२१ में दोनों के अनुसार मध्यम मेष संक्रान्ति अर्थात वर्षारम्भ एकही समय में होता है। इससे प्रकट होता है कि सूर्योदय में युगारम्भ मानने के कारण जो १५ घटी का अन्तर पड़ा था उसी को दूर करने के लिए आर्यभट ने वर्षमान १५ घटी न्यून माना हैं।&#xA;उक्त प्रमाणों के आधार पर भी आर्यभट का जन्म समय तो निर्विवाद है किन्तु जन्म स्थान को लेकर कुछ मतान्तर अवश्य है। आर्यभटीय में कुसुमपुर का उल्लेख करते हुए आचार्य ने लिखा है &amp;lsquo;कुसुमपुरेऽभ्यर्चितं ज्ञानम्&amp;rsquo; इस कथन के आधार पर कुछ लोग इनका&#xA;आर्यभट-प्रथम&#xA;३०१ जन्म स्थान कुसुम पुर (वर्तमान पटना) मानते हैं। कुछ लोगों का कथन है कि इनका जन्म दक्षिण में केरल और कर्नाटक की सीमा पर कुसुमपुर नामक स्थान पर हुआ है।&#xA;_ दक्षिण भारत में मानने के प्रमुख दो आधार हैं-१ भट उपधि प्रायः केरल में होती हैं। २ इनके ग्रन्थ (आर्यभटीय) की प्रथम उपलब्ध प्रति मलयालम लिपि में थी, जिसके&#xA;आधार पर डॉ० केर्न ने आर्यभटीय का सम्पादन एवं प्रकाशन करवाया था।&#xA;_ कुछ लोगों का मत है कि इनका जन्म महाराष्ट्र में अश्मक नामक स्थान पर हुआ था तथा बिहार के कुसुम पुर में राज्याश्रय प्राप्त कर वहीं इन्होंने अध्ययन और लेखन कार्य सम्पन्न किया। आर्यभटीय के भाष्यकार प्रथम भास्कर ने आर्यभट को अश्मक शब्द से ही संबोधित किया हैं। “सञ्चिन्त्याशु वदाश्मकस्य गणितं ज्ञातं त्वया चेद्यदि&amp;quot;।&amp;rsquo; यहाँ ‘अश्मकस्य गणितम्&amp;rsquo; का अभिप्राय अश्मक देशवासी आर्यभट की गणित से हैं। प्रथम भास्कर के अनुसार अश्मक देश नर्मदा और गोदावरी के बीच अवस्थित है। परन्तु बौद्धग्रन्थ दीर्घनिकाय के अनुसार बुद्ध के काल में अश्मक लोग पशचिमोत्तर प्रान्तों से आकर नर्मदा&#xA;और गोदावरी के बीच बस गये। यहाँ भी यही आशय है कि अश्मक देशवासी आर्यभट अध्ययन हेतु कुसुमपुर (पटना) में आये थे। डी०जी० आप्टे के अनुसार नालन्दा विश्वविद्यालय में ज्योतिष शास्त्र के उच्च अध्ययन की समुचित व्यवस्था थी। सम्भवतः वहाँ वेधशाला की भी व्यवस्था उस समय थी। इसी आकर्षण में आर्यभट ने अपना कार्यक्षेत्र कुसुम पुर वर्तमान पटना को चुना। एक पद्य में आर्यभट को सूर्यावतार कहा गया है तथा उसी पद्य से नालन्दा विश्वविद्यालय के कुलपति होने का भी संकेत मिलता है। “सूर्यः स्वयं कुसुमपुर्यभवत् कलौ तु भूगोलवित् कुलप आर्यभटाभिधानः&amp;quot; । यद्यपि इस पद्य का लेखक ज्ञात नहीं है फिर भी इस पद्य का महत्व इस लिए है कि कवि ने एक ही पंक्ति में तीन बातों को स्पष्टरूप से व्यक्त किया है। एक तो आर्यभट को सूर्यावतार दूसरे उनका जन्मस्थान कुसुम पुर, तीसरा आर्यभट कुलप अर्थात् कुलपति थे।&#xA;प्रसङ्गात् यहाँ खगौल रेलवे स्टेशन की चर्चा करना भी आवश्यक समझता हूँ जो पटना के निकटवर्ती दानापुर स्टेशन के पास है। खगौल स्टेशन के समीप ही खगौल नामक एक ग्राम भी है, जहाँ आर्यभट नामक एकविद्यालय भी हैं। पटना से पश्चिम दिशा में लगभग १५-२० कि०मी० की दूरी पर स्थित खगौल ग्राम भी खगोल वेत्ता आर्यभट की स्मृति का साक्षी हैं।&#xA;१. आर्यभटीयम, २.१।। २. दीर्घ निकाय, ६८।&#xA;सिद्धान्तपञ्चकविधावपि दृग्विरुद्धमौढ्योपरागमुखखेचरचारक्लृप्तौ।&#xA;सूर्यः स्वयं कुसुमपुर्यभवत् कलौ तु भूगोलवित् कुलप आर्यभटाभिधानः।। भा०ज्यो०, पृष्ठ-२७४ ।&#xA;१. षष्ठ्यब्दानां षष्ठियर्यदा व्यतीतास्त्रयश्च युगपादाः। त्र्यधिकविंशतिरब्दास्तदेह मम जन्मनोऽतीताः ।३-२०। २. भारतीय ज्योतिष, पृष्ठ ८१, ३. भारतीय ज्योतिष, पृष्ठ २६६ ।&#xA;३०२&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड उपलब्ध प्रमाणों के आधार पर ज्ञात होता है। कि ज्योतिषशास्त्र का अस्तित्व आर्यभट के पूर्व भी विकसित रुप में था किन्तु वेदांग काल के बाद एक अन्तराल दिखलाई देता है जिसमें किसी महत्वपूर्ण ग्रन्थ की रचना उपलब्ध नहीं होती इस लम्बे अन्तराल को भंग करते हुए आचार्य आर्यभट ने ज्योतिष के क्षेत्र में क्रान्तिकारी कार्य कर अपना एक स्वतन्त्र सम्प्रदाय स्थापित कर दिया।&#xA;आचार्य आर्यभट की लघुकाय रचना आर्यभटीम् के १२१ पद्यों में ही समस्त ज्योतिष . के सिद्धान्तों को प्रतिपादित कर दिया गया हैं, जो अपने आप में एक उदाहरण हैं। ये कुशल गणितज्ञ एवं खगोलज्ञ होने के साथ साथ अत्यन्त निर्भीक थे। इनकी अद्भुत प्रतिभा के कारण इन्हें सूर्य का अवतार माना जाता है। आज भी इनकी असन्दिग्ध उपलब्धियाँ अनुसन्धान की दृष्टि से अद्वितीय मानी जाती हैं। गणित और खगोल उन्हें हस्तामलकवत् होचुका था। पूर्ववर्ती आचार्यों ने पृथ्वी पर दिन-रात्रि के परिवर्तन का कारण सूर्य भ्रमण को ही माना है किन्तु आर्यभट ने इस भ्रम का निवारण करते हुए पृथ्वी के भ्रमण को कारण माना। इन्होंने पृथ्वी की दैनन्दिन गति (अक्षभ्रमण) की घोषणा कर सम्पूर्ण ज्योतिष जगत को चमत्कृत कर दिया था। अक्षभ्रमण को उदाहरण पूर्वक बतलाते हुए कहा कि जब हम नौका पर बैठ कर यात्रा करते हैं तो नदी के किनारे स्थित बृक्षादि विपरीत दिशा में चलते हुए प्रतीत होते है तथा नौका स्थिर सी प्रतीत होती है। इसी प्रकार का भ्रम हम पृथ्वीवासियों को होता है। हमें पृथ्वी स्थिर तथा ग्रहनक्षत्रादि विपरीत दिशा में चलते हुए प्रतीत होते हैं। जब कि हम पृथ्वी के साथ-साथ स्वयं भ्रमण करते हैं। सैद्धान्तिक रूप से भूभ्रमण के उल्लेख की यह सर्व प्रथम घटना थी। यहाँ यह स्पष्ट है कि आर्यभट ने दैनन्दिन अक्षभ्रमण का ही उल्लेख किया है। पृथ्वी द्वारा सूर्य की परिक्रमा का उन्होंने “प्राणेनैति कलां भूः” द्वारा संकेत मात्र ही किया है। जिसका अभिप्राय है कि पृथ्वी एक प्राण (१० विपल) में एक कला चलती है। परमेश्वर प्रभृति परवर्ती आचार्यों ने आर्यभट के मूल पाठ &amp;lsquo;प्राणेनैति कलां भूः&amp;rsquo; में पाठान्तर कर भू के स्थान पर भं कर दिया। इस परिवर्तन से आर्यभट का सिद्धान्त ही विपरीत होगया। इसकी व्याख्या की गई कि आचार्य ने पृथ्वी के भ्रमण को न बता कर भपञ्जर के भ्रमण का संकेत दिया है। यदि पाठान्तर को प्रमाण न माना जाय तो पृथ्वी की दैनन्दिन (अक्षभ्रमण) तथा वार्षिक (चक्र भ्रमण) दोनों का स्पष्ट ज्ञान आचार्य आर्यभट ने कर लिया था, यह स्वतः सिद्ध हो जाता है। किन्तु इसे पाठान्तर द्वारा विवादास्पद बना दिया गया है। सच्चाई यही है कि आर्यभट ने भूचलन के सिद्धान्त का रहस्य ज्ञात कर लिया था। उस काल के वैज्ञानिक जगत के लिए यह आविष्कार एक&#xA;आर्यभट-प्रथम&#xA;. ३०३ महत्वपूर्ण घटना थी। साथ ही इस प्रकार की घोषणा एक अदम्य साहस और निर्भीकता की परिचायक भी थी। इस महत्वपूर्ण रहस्योद्घाटन का श्रेय एकमात्र आचार्य आर्यभट को ही जाता है। आर्यभट ने किसी भी पूर्ववर्ती सिद्धान्त को यथावन स्वीकार नहीं किया। इन्होंने स्वयं वेध कर जो उचित परिणाम प्राप्त किया उसी को प्रमाण माना। इसके लिए इन्हें समकालीन आचार्यों द्वारा आलोचना का पात्र भी बनना पड़ा किन्तु इन आलोचनाओं से प्रभावित न होकर निर्भीकता से अपने सिद्धान्तों का प्रतिपादन करते रहे। काल विवेचन में भी इन्होंने अपनी मौलिकता प्रदर्शित की। इनकी कालगणना पूर्वाचार्यों की अपेक्षा अत्यन्त सरल है। इनकी कालगणना में ७२ महायुगों का एक मनु का प्रमाण माना गया है। जब कि अन्य सिद्धान्तों में ७१ महायुगों का एक मनु माना गया हैं। इनकी कालगना इस प्रकार हैं&#xA;४३,२०,००० सौर वर्षों का १ महायुग। ७२ महायुग का १ मनु। १००८ महायुग = १४ मनु का १ कल्प।&#xA;इनकी कालगणना में सन्ध्या सन्ध्यांशों को स्थान नहीं दियागया है तथा चारों युग पादों के प्रमाण को समान माना है। इस गणना की विशेषता यह है कि प्रत्येक कल्प का प्रथम दिन एक ही होता है तथा प्रत्येक युगपाद के अन्त में सभी ग्रहों के भगण पूर्णाकों में आते हैं। इस प्रकार इनकी कालगणना अधिक सरल एवं वैज्ञानिक है। गणित के क्षेत्र में भी इनकी अनेक उपलब्धियाँ आज भी भारतीय मनीषा का मानबर्धन कर रही हैं। _गणित के क्षेत्र में आर्यभट द्वारा प्रतिपादित वर्गमूल और घनमूल की पद्धति आज भी प्रचलित है। व्यास और परिधि के सम्वन्ध का मान आर्यभट द्वारा साधित ही सूक्ष्मतम माना जाता है, जो सूक्ष्मता हेतु दशमलव के चार अंको तक ग्रहण किया गया है। पाश्वात्य गणित के यशस्वी विद्वान आर्किमिडीज ने इस सम्बन्ध को पाई द्वारा व्यक्त किया था, किन्तु इसका मान आर्यभट के मान की अपेक्षा स्थूल माना जाता है। व्यास और परिधि के सम्बन्ध को प्रतिपादित करते हुए आर्यभट ने &amp;lsquo;चतुरधिकं शतमष्टगुणं&amp;rsquo; इत्यादि कारिका लिखी है। जिसका अभिप्राय यह है कि यदि व्यास का मान २०,००० फुट हो तो परिधि का मान ६२८३२ होगा। इसी से मिलता जुलता सिद्धान्त भास्कराचार्य ने भी प्रतिपादित किया है। यथा-व्यास को ३६२७ से गुणा कर १२५० से भाग देने पर सूक्ष्म परिधि का मान तथा व्यास को २२ से गुणा कर ७ से भाग देने पर स्कूल परिधि का मान ज्ञात होता हैं।&#xA;_ ज्या साधन भी आर्यभट की अद्भुत देन हैं। इतिहासकारों ने यद्यपि इसका श्रेय ग्रीक और अरबदेशीय गणितज्ञों को दिया है किन्तु गणितीय दृष्टि से देखा जाय तो पाश्चात्य गणिवशों ने पूर्णज्या का ही प्रयोग किया है। आर्यभट ने ही सर्व प्रथम अर्धज्या का साधन कर ग्रह गणित को एक नया आयाम दिया। ग्रीक या अरबी गणित में नवम शताब्दी के पूर्व अर्धज्या का कोई प्रमाण उपलब्ध नहीं हैं।&#xA;१. अनुलोमगतिौंस्थः पश्यत्यचत्लं विलोमगं यद्वत्। अचलानि भान्ति तद्वत् समपश्चिमगानि लङ्कायाम् ।।&#xA;आर्यभ., ४.६। २. प्राणेनैति कलां भूः खयुगांशे ग्रहजवो भवांशेऽर्कः। आर्यभ, १.६ ।&#xA;३०४&#xA;आर्यभट-प्रथम&#xA;३०५&#xA;5&#xA;too&#xA;१. क्&#xA;क्&#xA;क् ४. क् ५. क्&#xA;M&#xA;१. वर्गाक्षर और स्वरों के योग से संख्यायें अ = क = १ इ = . कि = १०० उ = कु = १०००० ऋ = कृ = लृ = क्लृ = । १००००००००&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A remarkable amount of information about submarine creatures is contained in Mansikka&amp;rsquo;s inquiry into Russian magic formulae, already mentioned; [1]  intermingled as the material is with the author&amp;rsquo;s rather violent &amp;ldquo;interpretatio christiana,&amp;rdquo; it is well-nigh impossible to lay one&amp;rsquo;s hands on the bare facts. This much can be said, however: in the middle of the &amp;ldquo;Blue Sea&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;the middle of the whole earth&amp;rdquo;), there is either (a) an island-most of the time called &lt;em&gt;Bujan&lt;/em&gt;, from the same radical as buoy — “the center of celestial power,&amp;quot; upon which there is a tree, or a stone, or a tree upon a stone, sometimes the cross or the &amp;ldquo;mountain of Zion&amp;rdquo; itself; [2]  or there is (b) the &amp;ldquo;White Altar-Stone,&amp;rdquo; which is a &amp;ldquo;fiery&amp;rdquo; one, lying in the navel of the sea without  being supported by an island; under this stone, there is &amp;ldquo;a green fire, the king of all fires,&amp;rdquo; or an &amp;ldquo;eternal, unquenchable fire&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;has to be procured from under  the stone&amp;rdquo; (Mansikka, p. 188 — we are not told for what purpose the fire has to be fetched from there; the text says only &amp;ldquo;for burning&amp;rdquo;). Sometimes it is said that upon this stone — regardless of its being &amp;ldquo;holy&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Stone of the Altar,&amp;rdquo; and even &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;rsquo;s Throne&amp;rdquo; — was the &amp;ldquo;habitation of the Devil himself&amp;rdquo;; [3]  in other formulae the point is stressed that this fire &amp;ldquo;scorches and burns the decayed and impure power of the devil&amp;rdquo; (i.e., &amp;ldquo;die verfallene, unreine Macht des Teufels,&amp;rdquo; where &amp;ldquo;verfallen&amp;rdquo; may mean either &amp;ldquo;decayed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;forfeited&amp;rdquo;). As long as this unquenchable fire remains safely under a stone, nothing dangerous is going to happen; accordingly, a German formula (Mansikka, p. 37) says: &amp;ldquo;In Christ&amp;rsquo;s Garden there is a well, in the well there is a stone, under the stone lies a golden snake.&amp;rdquo; That snake can also be a scorpion, as we have just seen (footnote 3).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some say that the Milky Way is the path taken by one of the stars at the time of the legendary fall of Phaethon; others say that it is the circle in which the sun once moved.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XIX — The Fall of Phaethon&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quel del sol, che suiando, fu combusto&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Per l&amp;rsquo; orazion della terra devota&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quando fu Giove arcanamente giusto&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DANTE, &lt;em&gt;Purg&lt;/em&gt;. XXIX. &lt;em&gt;118&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE GREAT AND OFFICIAL myth concerning the Galaxy is Phaethon&amp;rsquo;s transgression and the searing of the sky in his mad course. Manilius tells it in his astrological Poem: [1]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*. . . this was once the path&lt;br&gt;&#xA;**Where Phoebus drove; and that in length of Years&lt;br&gt;&#xA;**The heated track took Fire and burnt the Stars.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;**The Colour changed, the Ashes strewed the Way&lt;br&gt;&#xA;**And still preserve the marks of the Decay:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;**&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this second part of the series on Vedic chronology, we will discuss the ancient units of time along with water clock, method of identifying muhurtas of the day and solstices by measurement of shadow and method of insertion of intercalary month (Adhikamasa) in Vedic system. As &lt;em&gt;Adhikashadha&lt;/em&gt; (Second Ashadha/ Intercalary Ashadha) according to Vedic system starts from May 26, we will discuss about the research finding put forward in commentary of Vedanga Jyotisha (VJ) (6) on correct way of insertion of such intercalary month in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such stories are no jokes, although they make this impression when they cross our way in Eurasian folklore. &amp;ldquo;Air&amp;rdquo; is a strictly astronomical and, therefore, also a &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo; term. Thus, we hear from Rabbi Eleazar b. Pedath (ca. A.D. 270): &amp;ldquo;Als def Pharaoh aus Agypten auszog, die Israeliten zu verfolgen, erhoben sie ihre Augen gen Himmel und sahen den Engelsfürsten Ägyptens in der Luft fliegen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That signifies the fall of Egypt,&amp;rdquo; adds Bertholet, who mentions this case in his article on the &amp;ldquo;guardian angel of Persia&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Festschrift Pavry&lt;/em&gt;, p. 38), starting from Isa. XXIV.21 and its rabbinical interpretations. He also points to the utterance of Rabbi Chanina (ca. A.D. 225): &amp;ldquo;Nicht bestraft Gott fine Nation eher, als bis er zuvor ihren Engelfürsten im Himmel bestraft hat,&amp;rdquo; to which he compares Ps. XXIV.21: &amp;ldquo;On that day the Lord will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the earth, on the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &amp;ldquo;Earth&amp;rdquo; is replaced by a stone, Hephaistos by a shepherd, and Athena by the &amp;ldquo;beautiful Satana,&amp;rdquo; who watches carefully the pregnant stone and who, when the time comes, calls in the blacksmith who serves as midwife to the &amp;ldquo;stone-born&amp;rdquo; hero whose body is blue shining steel from head to foot, except the knees (or the hips) which are damaged by the pliers of the smith. The same Soszryko seduces a hostile giant to measure the depth of the sea in the same manner as Michael or Elias causes the devil to dive, making the sea freeze in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This suggests that it might have been an ancient association.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Aitareya brāhmaṇa indicates that it was used to mark the day just before the svarasāman days during the annual sattra. Tilak we believe rightly realized this was the reason why Abhijit was important in the early period to mark this ritual day which in turn is critical for marking the days leading up to the Viśuvān day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is far away from the ecliptic and has been dropped even by the time of the mahAbhArata where indra mentions this to skanda in a cryptic legend. This probably was due to precession making it no longer suitable for marking the days for the specific abhijit ritual in the annual sattra. Since this was recorded in the bhArata itself, I believe it is evidence for the actual coeval use of the kRttikAdi system in early history before its precession by the time of the bhArata.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; we have the great Ring Nebula M 57 which is one of the best planetary nebulae for a small scope. I have even managed it with my 20 x 70 binocs on good nights. The double-double (Epsilon Lyrae) NW of abhijit is a good wide multiple system for beginners. The globular cluster of M 56 is also a good sight at the lower part of the constellation.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. रामचन्द्र पाण्डेय&#xA;ब्राह्म परम्परा के अनुयायी तथा वेध प्रक्रिया के संस्थापक आयार्च ब्रह्मगुप्त का जन्म शक ५२० में राजस्थान और गुजरात के मध्यवर्ती क्षेत्र में हुआ था। श्री शंकर बालकृष्ण दीक्षित के अनसार इनका जन्म आब पर्वत के निकट आब से ४० मील पश्चिमोत्तर दिशा में लूणी नदी के पास उत्तरी गुजरात तथा मारवाण की सीमा पर स्थित भिन्नमाल नामक स्थान में हुआ था। प्राचीन काल में यह स्थान गुजरात का हिस्सा था। इसे भिलमाल या श्रीमाल नाम से भी जाना जाता है। सिद्धान्त के संज्ञाध्याय के अनुसार चाप वंश के व्याघ्रमुख नामक राजा के शासनकाल शक ५५० में इन्हों ने ब्राह्मस्फुट सिद्धान्त की रचना की तथा शक ५५० में इनकी आयु ३० वर्ष की थी। इनका जन्म शक ५२० अर्थात् ई० सन् ५६८ में हुआ था। इनके पिता का नाम जिष्णुगुप्त था। सातवीं शताब्दी के चीनी यात्री वेनसांग के अनुसार भिल्लमाल उस समय उत्तर गुजरात की राजधानी थी। व्याघ्रमुख राजा के शासनकाल में इन्होंने अपने ग्रन्थ की रचना की थी। इस लिए इन्हें भिल्लमालकाचार्य भी कहा जाता था। शंकरबालकृष्ण दीक्षित के अनुसार चावणे या चापोत्कट वंश का राज्य सन् ७५६ ई० से ६४१ ई० पर्यन्त रहा। सम्भवतः यह चावणे वंश ही ब्रह्मगुप्त द्वारा निर्दिष्ट चापवंश रहा होगा। ब्राह्मस्फुटसिद्धान्त इनकी पहली कृति हैं। ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त नाम से कई सिद्धान्त प्रचलित रहे हैं। कुछ लोगों ने पञ्चसिद्धान्तोक्त ब्राह्म सिद्धान्त को तथा कुछ लोगों ने विष्णुधर्मोत्तर पुराणान्तर्गत ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त को इनकी रचना का आधार माना हैं। महान भाषाशास्त्री अलबेरुनी (अबू रेहान मुहम्मद इब्न अहमद अलबरूनी) को केवल ब्रह्मगुप्त विरचित ब्रह्म सिद्धान्त की ही जानकारी थी। उपलब्ध ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त का परिचय प्रस्तुत करते हुये अलबरूनी ने लिखा हैं कि-इसका नाम ब्रह्मा के नाम पर पड़ा है और इसकी रचना ब्रह्मगुप्त ने की हैं जो जिष्णु का पुत्र था, मुल्तान एवं अनहिलवाड़ा के वीच अनहिलवाड़ा से १६ योजन की दूरी पर स्थित भील्लमाल नामक नगर का निवासी था।&amp;rsquo; कुछ लोग ब्रह्मस्फुट सिद्धान्त को इनकी मौलिक रचना मानते है तथा कुछ लोग पूर्ववर्ती ब्राह्म सिद्धान्तों में से किसी एक को इसका आधार मानते हैं। परन्तु स्वयं ब्रह्मगुप्त के अनुसार&#xA;ब्रह्मोक्तं ग्रहगणितं महता कालेन यत् खिलीभूतम्।&#xA;अभिधीयते स्फुटं तज्जिष्णुसुतब्रह्मगुप्तेन ।। संसाध्य स्पष्टतरं बीजं नलिकादियन्त्रेभ्यः।&#xA;तत्संस्कृतग्रहेभ्यः कर्तव्यौ निर्णयादेशौ।। १. श्रीचापवंशतिलके श्रीव्याघ्रमुखे नृपे शकनृपाणाम्। पञ्चाशत् संयुक्तैर्वर्षशतैः पञ्चव्यतीतैः।।&#xA;ब्राह्मस्फुटसिद्धान्तः सज्जनगणितज्ञगोलवित्प्रीत्यै। त्रिंशद्वर्षेण कृतो जिष्णुसुतब्रह्मगुप्तेन ।।&#xA;ब्रास्फु० सि० ७,८. २. भारत अलबेरुनी पृष्ट, ६६-६७ (डॉ० एडवर्ड सी० सखाऊके अंग्रेजी अनुवाद का नूरनबी अब्बासी&#xA;द्वारा हिन्दी अनुवाद)&#xA;३३८&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड अर्थात् ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त जो अत्यन्त प्राचीन होने से त्रुटिपूर्ण हो गया था। उसे जिष्णु के पुत्र ब्रह्मगुप्त ने परिष्कृत कर स्पष्ट कर दिया। नलिकादि यन्त्रों द्वारा स्फुटबीज साधन कर उससे संस्कृत ग्रहों द्वारा निर्णय और आदेश करना चाहिये। ब्रह्मगुप्त के इन वाक्यों तथा इनके द्वारा गृहीत मानों के आधार पर इनके ग्रन्थ का प्रमुख स्रोत विष्णुधर्मोत्तर पुराणान्तर्गत ब्रह्मपुराण ही माना जाता है। परन्तु इनकी मौलिकता भी उल्लेखनीय हैं। (१) ब्रह्मगुप्त का वर्ष मान सभी सिद्धान्तों से भिन्न है। पञ्च-सिद्धान्तिका के सूर्यसिद्धान्त&#xA;का वर्षमान ३६५-१५-३१-३०, आर्य-सिद्धान्त का वर्षमान ३६५-१५-३१-१५ तथा ब्रह्मगुप्त का ३६५-१५-३०-२२-३० हैं। उक्त सिद्धान्तों की तुलना में ब्रह्मगुप्त&#xA;का वर्षमान क्रमशः १-७-३० पलादि तथा ५२-३० विपलादि न्यून है। (२) ब्रह्मगुप्त ने सायन सङ्क्रान्तियाँ ग्रहण की है। यह तथ्य शक ५४० में मेष सङ्क्रान्ति&#xA;की गणना से प्रकाश में आया, क्यों कि जिस समय ब्रह्मगुप्त के मत से सूर्य का मेष राशि में संक्रमण हुआ उस समय से ५४-१-५३ घट्यादि पश्चात् आर्य सिद्धान्त से तथा ५४-५-५१ घट्यादि पश्रात् सूर्यसिद्धान्त से सूर्य का सङ्क्रामण मेष राशि में हुआ था। इतना ही नहीं उस काल में किसी भी समय की सायन संक्रान्ति का काल ब्रह्मगुप्त की गणना से साम्य रखता था। शंकरबालकृष्ण दीक्षित ने दूसरा उदाहरण देते हुए लिखा हैं कि शक ५०६ में ब्राह्मसिद्धान्तानुसार स्पष्ट मेषसंक्रान्ति चैत्रशुक्ल ३ भौमवार दिनांक १८ मार्च सन् ५८७ के उज्जयिनीके मध्यम सूर्योदय से ५६ घटी ४० पल पर आती हैं। उस वर्ष में सायन स्पष्ट रवि की संक्रान्ति भी उसी दिन उसी समय आती है। ब्रह्मगुप्त का जन्म शक ५२० में हुआ था। उन्हों ने शक ५४० के आसन्न वेध करना आरम्भ किया होगा। शक ५४० में ब्राह्मसिद्धान्तानुसार स्पष्ट मेष संक्रान्ति चैत्र कृष्ण १ शनिवार को ५७ घटी २२ पल पर आती है तथा उस समय सायन स्पष्ट रवि का मान ० राशि ० अंश ३० कला आता है। अर्थात् ब्रह्मगुप्त की मेष संक्रान्ति के लगभग ३० घटी पूर्व सायन मेष संक्रान्ति होती है। मेष संक्रान्ति के समय ३० घटी में सूर्य की क्रान्ति लगभग १२ कला बढ़ती है। अतः शक ५४० में ब्राह्मसिद्धान्तीय मेष संक्रान्ति के समय सूर्य विषुव वृत्त से केवल १२ कला उत्तर रहा होगा। यदि उस दिन सूर्योदय के समय ही ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त की संक्रान्ति हुई होती तो उस समय पूर्व विन्दु से १२ कला उत्तर की ओर सूर्य का मध्यविन्द दिखाई दिया होगा। इस अन्तर के कारण यही हो सकते हैं-१. मेष संक्रान्ति सूर्योदय में ही नहीं हुआ करती थी। २. दिक्साधन में भी कुछ कलाओं की अशुद्धि होने की सम्भावना है। ३. वेध के साधन स्थूल थे। इन कारणों को ध्यान में रखते हुए यह सहज में जाना जा सकता है कि १२ कलाओं की अशुद्धि होना असम्भव नहीं है। इससे निश्चित रूप से यही ज्ञात होता है&#xA;ब्रह्मगुप्त&#xA;३३६ सायन रवि के मेषसंक्रमण को ही मेष संक्रमण माना था। इस सन्दर्भ में ब्रह्मगुप्त का यह पद्य भी विचारणीय हैं।&#xA;यदि भिन्नाः सिद्धान्ता भास्करसंक्रान्तयोऽ पि भेदसमाः।&#xA;स स्पष्टः पूर्वस्यां विषुवत्यर्कोदयो यस्य ।। २४.४।। अर्थात् यदि सिद्धान्त भिन्न हैं तो सूर्य की संक्रांतियाँ भी उसी भेदानुसार ही होनी चाहिए। परन्तु वह सूर्य तो विषुव दिन में उदय के समय पूर्व में स्पष्ट दिखाई देता है। इसका आशय यही है कि सूर्य की संक्रान्तियाँ आकाश में भिन्न-भिन्न समयों में नहीं दिखाई देगी। यहाँ विषुव दिन के सूर्योदय कालीन सूर्य का उल्लेख हैं। अतः वह सायन ही है और यह भी स्पष्ट है कि ब्रह्मगुप्त ने यह बात वेध के आधार पर लिखी है। उन्होंने अयन की चर्चा नहीं की हैं। इससे यह अनुमान है कि उन्हें अयन गति का ज्ञान नहीं था। यदि उस समय अयनगति का ज्ञान रहा भी होगा तो यह स्पष्ट है कि ब्रह्मगुप्त ने अयन का विचार नहीं किया है। अतः उनकी दृष्टि में सायन और निरयन दो भिन्न पदार्थ नहीं थे। उन्होंने अपने सिद्धान्त को इस प्रकार बनाया कि उससे सायन ही सूर्य आये। सायन और निरयन की यह अभेद व्यवस्था उन्हीं के काल तक थी। इसका कारण यही था कि आचार्य ब्रह्मगुप्त ने प्राचीन परम्परा से प्रभावित होकर अपने काल में पड़ने वाले संक्रान्ति के अन्तर (५४ घटी) को कलियुगारम्भ से ग्रन्थरचना काल के अन्तर्गत विभक्त कर अपनी त्रुटि का समाधान कर लिया। इस संशोधन से यद्यपि वर्षमान में कुछ न्यूनता आगई किन्तु मेष संक्रान्ति में सूर्योदय ठीक पूर्व दिशा में होने की गणित को उन्होंने व्यवस्थित कर लिया। इस प्रक्रिया से तत्काल तो वे सन्तुष्ट होगये किन्तु एक बहुत बड़ा प्रश्न छोड़ गये कि सायन संक्रान्तियों को ग्रहण करते हुये सायन वर्षमान का ग्रहण क्यों नहीं किया? अन्ततः उनके समर्थक आचार्य भास्कर को यह कहना पड़ा&#xA;.. &amp;ldquo;नहि क्रान्तिपातो नास्तीति वक्तुं शक्यते। प्रत्यक्षेण तस्योपलब्धत्वात्। उपलब्धिप्रकारमग्रे वक्ष्यति। तत् कथं ब्रह्मगुप्तादिभिर्निपुणैरपि नोक्त इति चेत्। तदा स्वल्पत्वात् तै!पलब्धः।” (वासनाभाष्य : गो०ब० १७-१६)&#xA;आचार्य भास्कर ने स्वयं प्रश्र उठा कर स्वयं समाधान भी कर दिया कि अत्यन्त स्वल्प होने के कारण ब्रह्मगुप्त ने अयन गति का ग्रहण नहीं किया। अब अधिक होने के कारण उसका ग्रहण करनाआवश्यक है। यद्यपि सायन निरयन का विवाद आज भी है। परम्परा यही है कि वेध हेतु गणना सायन की की जाती है किन्तु पञ्चाङ्गों का निर्माण निरयन पद्धति से ही किया जाता है। आचार्य ब्रह्म गुप्त का वर्षमान भगण आदि उनकी मौलिक कल्पना हैं। इससे स्पष्ट हैं कि ब्रह्मगुप्त ने गोल गणित को भली भाति समझ लिया था। किन्तु परम्परा का अनुसरण एवं पूर्वाचार्यों का सम्मान भी उन्हें अभीष्ट था। इस लिए अपने मत का केवल संकेत कर पुनः परम्परा पर आगये।&#xA;३४०&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A faint, though rather pleasant, echo of such huge events, comes from an Esthonian story about the Lake Eim changing his bed (Grimm, TM, p. 599):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On his banks lived wild and wicked men, who never mowed the meadows that he watered, nor sowed the fields he fertilized, but robbed and murdered, so that his bright wave was befouled with the blood of the slain. And the lake mourned; and one evening he called his fish together, and mounted with them into the air. The brigands hearing a din cried: &amp;ldquo;The Eim has left his bed, let us collect his fish and hidden treasure.&amp;rdquo; But the fish were gone, and nothing was found at the bottom but snakes, toads and salamanders, which came creeping out and lodged with the ruffian brood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Weinreich (&amp;ldquo;Zum Tode des Grossen Pan,&amp;rdquo; ARW &lt;em&gt;13&lt;/em&gt; [1910] pp. 467-73) has collected the evidence for such strange notions, first found in 1549 (Guillaume Bigot), then three years later in Rabelais&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Pantagruel&lt;/em&gt;, and ridiculed in later times, e.g., by Fontenelle, in the beginning of the 18th century: &amp;ldquo;Ce grand Pan qui meurt sous Tibere, aussi bien que Jésus-Christ, est le Maistre des Demons, dont l&amp;rsquo;Empire est ruiné par cette mort d&amp;rsquo;un Dieu si salutaire à l&amp;rsquo;Univers; ou si cette explication ne vous plaist pas, car enfin on peut sans impieté donner des sens contraires à une mesme chose, quoy qu&amp;rsquo;elle regarde la Religion; ce grand Pan est Jesus-Christ luy-mesme, dont la mort cause une douleur et une consternation genéralé parmy leg Demons, qui ne peuvent plus exercer leur tirannie sur les hommes. C&amp;rsquo;est ainsi qu&amp;rsquo;on a trouvé moyen de donner à ce grand Pan deux faces bien differentes&amp;rdquo; (Weinreich, PP.472-73).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXI — The Great Pan Is Dead&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EVERYONE HAS ONCE READ, for it comes up many times in literature, of that pilot in the reign of Tiberius, who, as he was sailing along in the Aegean on a quiet evening, heard a loud voice announcing that &amp;ldquo;Great Pan was dead.&amp;rdquo; This engaging myth was interpreted in two contradictory ways. On the one hand, it announced the end of paganism: Pan with his pipes, the demon of still sun-drenched noon, the pagan god of glade and pasture and the rural idyll, had yielded to the supernatural. On the other hand the myth has been understood as telling of the death of Christ in the 19th year of Tiberius: the Son of God who was everything from Alpha to Omega was identified with Pan = &amp;ldquo;All.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. सर्वनारायण झा&#xA;भास्कराचार्य द्वितीय सिद्धान्तज्योतिष के अत्यन्त उच्च कोटि के विद्वान हुए हैं। सम्पूर्ण विश्व में इनकी ख्याति रही है। इनके द्वारा रचित सिद्धान्त शिरोमणि एवं करण कुतूहल सर्वत्र प्रसिद्ध है। सिद्धान्त शिरोमणि के चार भाग हैं। १. लीलावती (पाटीगणित), २. बीजगणित ३. गोलाध्याय एवं ४. गणिताध्याय। विभिन्न स्थानों पर प्राप्त उद्धरणों से ज्ञात होता है कि भास्कर द्वितीय की कुछ और भी कृतियाँ रहीं होगी । जिनमें विवाहपटल, भास्कर-व्यवहार और सर्वतोभद्रयन्त्र का तो उल्लेख भी प्राप्त होता है। सिद्धान्त शिरोमणि सिद्धान्तग्रन्थ&amp;rsquo; है और करणकुतूहल करणग्रन्थ आचार्य भास्कर का जन्म शक संवत् १०३६२ में यजुर्वेदीय माध्यन्दिनशाखाध्यायी शाण्डिल्य गोत्रीय ब्राह्मणकुल में सहयपर्वत के पास विज्जडविड् नामक ग्राम में हुआ था। इनके पिता का नाम महेश्वर था। वे उनके गुरु&#xA;भी थे।&#xA;अकबर ने शके १५०६ में भास्कराचार्य के लीलावती का परशियन भाषा में अनुवाद करवाया था। उस अनुवादक का मत है कि भास्कराचार्य द्वितीय का जन्म बेदर में हुआ था। बेदर सोलापूर से लगभग १५० कि०मी० पूर्व मोगलई में है। वह स्थान सहय पर्वत के पास नहीं है। मोगलई में बेदर से लगभग पचास कि०मी० पश्चिम में कल्याण नाम का एक प्रसिद्ध शहर है। भास्कराचार्य के काल में वहाँ चालुक्य वंश का राज्य था। इतने पास में रहकर भी उस राज्य के साथ भास्कराचार्य जैसे विद्वान् का सम्बन्ध नहीं रहना अस्वाभाविक सा लगता है। चंगदेव के शिलालेख के &amp;lsquo;जैत्रपालेन यो नीतः५ वाक्य से पता चलता है कि भास्कराचाय के पुत्र लक्ष्मीधर को राजा जैत्रपाल ने पाटणपुर से बुलवाया था। पाटणपुर गाँव यादवों की राजधानी देवगिरि के पास ही है और सहयपर्वत की एक शाखा चाँदबड़ की पहाड़ी से लगी है। बहाल नामक गाँव जहाँ भास्कर के वंशज अनन्तदेव का बनवाया हुआ मन्दिर है, वह भी पाटण के पास लगभग तीस कि०मी० पर है। उसके पास&#xA;१. त्रुट्यादिप्रलयान्तकालकलना मानप्रभेद: क्रमाच्चारश्च धुसदां द्विधा च गणितं प्रश्नास्तथा सोत्तराः।&#xA;भूधिष्ण्यग्रहसंस्थितेश्च कथनं यन्त्रादि यत्रोच्यते सिद्धान्तः स उदाहृतोऽत्र गणितस्कन्धप्रबन्धे बुधैः ।। रसगुणपूर्णमही (१०३६) समशकनृपसमये ऽभवन्ममोत्पत्तिः। (सिद्धान्तशिरोमणि, गोलाध्याय, प्रश्नाध्याय, श्लो० सं० ५८ पूर्वार्द्ध)&#xA;आसीत् सह्यकुलाचलाश्रितपुरे त्रैविद्यविद्वज्जने नाना सज्जनधाम्नि विज्जडविडे शाण्डिल्यगोत्रो द्विजः । श्रौतस्मार्तविचारसारचतुरो निःशेषविद्यानिधिः साधूनामवधिर्महेश्वरकृती दैवज्ञचूडामणिः ।।&#xA;तज्जस्तच्चरणारविन्दयुगलप्राप्तप्रसादः सुधीः (सिद्धान्तशिरोमणि, गोला, प्रश्ना, श्लो, ६१-६४) ४. पॉट्स अल्जेब्रा (१८८६) भाग-२। 5. चंगदेव का शिलालेख श्लो० सं० २२ (एपिग्राफिका इण्डिका, ग्र. १, पृष्ठ-३४०)&#xA;भास्कराचार्य-द्वितीय&#xA;३४६&#xA;३४८&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड ही विज्जड़विड़ जैसा गाँव था। इस समय इसकी प्रसिद्धि नहीं है। संभवतः यही भास्कराचार्य का गाँव रहा हो।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &lt;em&gt;Sūrya&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Siddhānta&lt;/em&gt; states: &amp;ldquo;In Taurus, the 17th degree, a planet of which the latitude is a little more than two degrees, south, will split the &lt;em&gt;wain of Rohini&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Burgess (p. 214), Rohini&amp;rsquo;s (= Aldebaran) wain &amp;ldquo;contains five stars, in the grouping of which Hindu fancy has seen the figure of a wain,&amp;rdquo; i.e., the Hyades, containing epsilon, delta, gamma, nu, alpha Tauri. Burgess continues (p. 249): &amp;ldquo;The &lt;em&gt;Siddhanta&lt;/em&gt; does not inform us what would be the consequences of such an occurrence; that belongs rather to the domain of astrology than of astronomy. We cite from the &lt;em&gt;Pancatantra&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 238-241) the following description of these consequences, derived from the astrological writings of Varahamihira:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXII — The Adventure and the Quest&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH in its first recorded version goes back to Sumerian times. [1]  It has been rehearsed with variants by Hurrians and Hittites, by Babylonians and Assyrians. Even in the best recensions there are large gaps, many tablets are damaged beyond repair, and to aggravate these detrimental conditions one must add the efforts of a goodly number of specialists which have not helped to clarify matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;डॉ. अशोक थपलियाल&#xA;अनेक रहस्यों से युक्त ज्योतिष शास्त्र महासमुद्र है। ब्रह्माण्ड के अनेक तत्त्वों रहस्योद्घाटन में प्रवृत्त ज्योतिषशास्त्र में ग्रह-नक्षत्र, धूमकेतु, उल्कापात आदि ज्योतिःपदार्थों के स्वरुप, गति, स्थित्यादि निरीक्षण करने पर ये तारे क्या वस्तु हैं? इनमें पूर्व की ओर गतिमान ज्योतिःपुंज क्या हैं? चन्द्र का स्वरुप प्रतिदिन क्यों बदलता रहता है? स्वच्छ पूर्णिमा की रात्रि को कभी चन्द्र धूमिल या कुछ देर के लिए अदृश्य सा क्यों हो जाता है? स्वच्छ दिन में कभी कभी सूर्य की प्रभा क्षीण क्यों पड़ जाती है? ऋतुओं का आवागमन का चक्र कैसे चलता है? इत्यादि क्या? क्यों? और कैसे? जैसे प्रश्नों ने उसे उद्वेलित किया। इन्हीं प्रश्नों के उत्तर जानने की चाह ने ज्योतिषशास्त्र की नींव रखी। हमारे ऋषि-महर्षियों एवं पूर्वाचार्यों ने भी ज्योतिःपदार्थों की गति-स्थित्यादि के अतिरिक्त आकाश में घटने वाली ग्रहण जैसी आश्चर्यजनक घटनाओं का भी सतत निरीक्षण करके द्वारा प्राणियों पर पड़ने वाले शुभाशुभ प्रभाव का विश्लेषण कर ज्योतिषशास्त्र के मानक सिद्धान्तों का प्रतिपादन किया। उनके द्वारा रचित ज्योतिषशास्त्र के सिद्धान्तरुपी अनमोल रत्न ज्योतिशास्त्र की अमूल्य धरोहर हैं। वैदिक दर्शन की अवधारणा पर आधारित ज्योतिशास्त्र वेदांग के नेत्र के रूप में प्रतिष्ठित है।&amp;rsquo; वेदांग ज्योतिष में सभी वेदांगों में इसकी प्रधानता स्वीकार की गयी है। यथा&#xA;होरा स्कन्ध विमर्श&#xA;३६६ . ज्योतिषशास्त्र के मुख्यतया सिद्धान्त, होरा एवं संहिता ये तीन स्कन्ध है।&amp;rsquo; सिद्धान्त स्कन्ध गणितात्मक है। इसमें मुख्यतया ग्रहों की गति, स्थिति, दिग्देश एवं कालगणनाविषयकी विवेचना प्राप्त होती है। ग्रहों के प्रभाव का अध्ययन कर शुभाशुभफलनिरूपण होरा एंव संहिता का वर्ण्य विषय है। मुख्यतया काल को आधार बनाकर ही फलविवेचना के लिए जन्मकालीन ग्रहों की स्थिति के अनुसार कुण्डली का निर्माण किया जाता है। जन्मकुण्डली के द्वादश भावों में स्थिति ग्रहों के परस्परसम्बन्धादि का विचार कर वैयक्तिकफल का विवेचन होरास्कन्ध में किया जाता है। समष्टिगतफल का विवेचन संहितास्कन्ध में प्राप्त होता है। संहितास्कन्ध में शकुन, वास्तुप्रभृति विषय भी आते हैं। इस प्रकार मानव जीवन से सम्बन्धित विभिन्न पहलुओं का अध्ययन कर उसे समुचित मार्गदर्शन देना ज्योतिषशास्त्र का मुख्य लक्ष्य है। पान&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXIII — Gilgamesh and Prometheus&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; . . . quand les esprits bienheureux&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dans la Voie de Laict auront fait&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;nouveaux feux . . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agrippa d’Aubigné&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FIRE IS, INDEED, a key word, deserving a special inquiry. For the time being, however, it is not essential to understand everything about the different norms and measures, rules and regulations which have to be procured by gods or heroes who are destined to open &amp;ldquo;new ways.&amp;rdquo; One can ignore here the true nature and identity of the various &amp;ldquo;treasures,&amp;rdquo; whether they are called &amp;ldquo;oar&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ferry man,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;hvarna-melammu,&amp;rdquo; or. &amp;ldquo;golden fleece,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fire.&amp;rdquo; This is not to say that all these terms are different names for the same thing, but that they identify several parts of the frame.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;प्रो. रामचन्द्र पाण्डेय&#xA;सिद्धान्तज्योतिष को परिभाषित करते हुये आचार्य भास्कर ने लिखा है कि जहाँ त्रुटि (काल की लघुतम इकाई) से लेकर प्रलयान्त काल तक की काल गणना की गई हो, कालमानों के सौर-सावन-नाक्षत्र आदि भेदों का निरूपण किया गया हो, ग्रहों की मार्ग वक्र-शीघ्र-मन्द आदि गतियो का निरूपण हो, अंक (पाटी) गणित, एवं बीजगणित दोनों गणित विधाओं का विवेचन किया गया हो, उत्तर सहित प्रश्नों का विवेचन हो. पृथ्वी की स्थिति, स्वरूप एवं गति का निरूपण हो, ग्रहों की कक्षा क्रम एवं वेधोपयोगी यन्त्रों का जहाँ वर्णन किया गया हो उसे सिद्धान्त ज्योतिष कहा गया है।&#39;&#xA;इस परिभाषा से ही व्यक्त होता रहा है कि सिद्धान्त का क्षेत्र कितना विस्तृत तथा प्रामाणिक है। यहाँ जो भी नियम या सिद्धान्त ग्रह गणना के लिए बनाये जाते है वे गणित&#xA;और वेध द्वारा परीक्षण के बाद ही प्रकाश में लाये जाते हैं। आज की प्रमुख विडम्बना है कि ग्रन्थों का अध्ययन तो हो रहा है, किन्तु प्रयोग पक्ष (वेध) पूर्णतः उपेक्षित हो गया है। परिणामतः सिद्धान्तज्योतिष में कई शतकों से परिष्कार अवरुद्ध है। भारत का यह एक विशिष्ट विज्ञान स्थूल होता जा रहा है।&#xA;_ सिद्धान्त के क्षेत्र में सर्व प्रथम ब्राह्म-वसिष्ठ-रोमक-पौलिश तथा सूर्य इन पाँच सिद्धान्तों का उल्लेख मिलता है, जिनका संकलन आचार्य वराहमिहिर ने ४२७ शक के आसन्न किया था। इनके अतिरिक्त मौलिक रचना के रूप में प्रथम की आर्यभटीयम् लगभग ४२१ शक में आयी। इस लघुकाय ग्रन्थ के आने से सिद्धान्त के क्षेत्र में एक नई दृष्टि का संचार हुआ। आर्यभट ने परम्परा से हटकर युग एवं मनु के मानों में परिवर्तन किया। ७१ महायुग के स्थान पर ७२ महायुगों का एक मन्वन्तर माना। इसी प्रकार पृथ्वी को स्थिर न मानकर उसे चल बतलाया।&#xA;शक ५५० के आसन्न भिन्नमाल निवासी बाह्मसिद्धान्त को आधार माना किन्तु अति प्राचीन होने के कारण ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त को आधार माना किन्तु अति प्राचीन होने के कारण ब्राह्मसिद्धान्त के त्रुटियों को देखते हुये उसे यथावत स्वीकार न करते हुये उन्हें परिष्कृत&#xA;सिद्धान्तज्योतिष&#xA;३७७ किया। प्रायः आर्यभट्ट और ब्रह्मगुप्त इन्हीं दोनों आचार्यों की कृतियों को आधार मान कर परवर्ती आचार्यों ने अपने-अपने सिद्धान्त ग्रन्थों की रचना की।&#xA;. सिद्धान्त ग्रन्थों में प्रायः एक साम्य देखा जाता है। सभी ग्रन्थों में मध्यमाधिकार, त्रिप्रश्नाधिकार, चन्द्रग्रहणाधिकार तक प्रायः साम्य रहता है। इसके बाद अध्यायों में भिन्नता रहती है। इन अधिकारों के नाम सार्थक हैं तथा विषयानुसार हैं। इसीलिए इन नामों को सभी आचार्यों ने स्वीकार किया। मध्यमाधिकार में सर्वप्रथम अहर्गण का साधन किया जाता है। सिद्धान्त ग्रन्थों के अहर्गण का साधन कल्पारम्भ से इष्ट दिन तक, तन्त्र ग्रन्थों में युगारम्भ से इष्ट काल तक, तथा करण ग्रन्थों में शकारम्भ से अभीष्ट काल पर्यन्त अहर्गण निकालने का विधान दिया गया है। अहर्गण ज्ञात होने पर अनुपात (त्रैराशिक) से मध्यम ग्रहों का साधन किया जाता है।&#xA;अनन्तर स्पष्टाधिकार में मन्दफल-शीघ्रफल दोनों संस्कारों का साधन कर मध्यम ग्रह में संस्कार करने से इष्टकालिक स्पष्ट ग्रह होते हैं।&#xA;त्रिप्रश्नाधिकार-इस अधिकार का नाम दिक्-देश और काल सम्बन्धी प्रश्नों के समाधान के कारण रखा गया है। इस अधिकार में सर्वप्रथम दिक् साधन की विधि बतलाई गई है। अनन्तर अक्षांश, देशान्तर साधन द्वारा किसी स्थान अथवा स्थान विशेष को ज्ञात करने की विधि दी गई है। स्थान का ज्ञान हो जाने पर वहाँ की पलभा ज्ञात कर उस स्थान के क्षितिज पर सभी राशियों के उदयमान का आनयन किया जाता है। उदयमान ज्ञान कर क्षितिजस्थ लग्न का साधन किया जाता है।&#xA;लग्न-राशिचक्र के दैनिक भ्रमण काल ६० घटी में (२४ घण्टे) में राशिचक्र का प्रत्येक भाग स्थानीय क्षितिज को स्पर्श करता है। जिस समय क्षितिज पर जिस राशि के भाग का स्पर्श होगा उसके काल की वही लग्न होगी।&#xA;पलभा-सायन मेष संक्राति के समय समतल धरातल पर द्वादश अंगुल शंकु की छाया अंगुलात्मक मान में स्थानीय पलभा होती है। - अक्षांश-स्थानीय क्षितिज से ध्रुवतारा की उन्नति कोणीय मान से अक्षांश तुल्य होती है। यह दूरी दोनों ध्रुवों एवं खमध्य में जाने वाली याम्योत्तर वृत्त में मापी जाती है। यह दक्षिणोत्तर अन्तर को व्यक्त करता है। _देशान्तर-दो स्थानों के पूर्वापर अन्तर को देशान्तर कहा जाता है। इसका मापन रेखादेश से किया जाता है। प्राचीन काल में रेखादेश लंका, उज्जैन, कुरुक्षेत्र आदि देशों से होता हुआ उत्तर में ध्रुव प्रदेश तक जाता था।&#xA;नाड़ी वृत्त-ध्रुव स्थान से ६०° अंश पर स्थित वृत्त (आकाश के मध्य में पूर्व से पश्चिम जाने वाला वृत्त) नाड़ी वृत्त होता है। इसे काल वृत्त भी कहते है। इसी में काल गणना की जाती है।&#xA;१. त्रुट्यादिप्रलयान्तकालकलना-मानप्रभेदः क्रमा&#xA;च्चारश्च धुसदां द्विधा च गणितं प्रश्नास्तथा सोत्तराः। भूधिष्णग्रहसंस्थितेश्च कथनं यन्त्रादि यत्रोच्यते&#xA;सिद्धान्तः स उदाहृतोऽत्र गणितस्कन्धप्रबन्धे बुधैः ।। (सिद्धान्तशिरोमणि, गणिताध्याय, श्लो. ६) २. अनुलोमगतिर्नोस्थः पश्यत्यचलं विलोमगं यद्वत्।&#xA;अचलानि भान्ति तद्वत् समपश्चिमगानि लंकायाम्।। (आर्यभटीयम्)&#xA;सिद्धान्तज्योतिष&#xA;३७६ सिद्धान्त ज्योतिष में जिन आचार्यों का महत्वपूर्ण योगदान है उनका तथा उनकी कृतियों का संक्षिप्त विवरण इस प्रकार है&#xA;आचार्य&#xA;समय&#xA;प्रमुख कृति&#xA;आर्यभट&#xA;शक ३६८&#xA;१. आर्यभटीयम्&#xA;वराहमिहिर&#xA;शक ४०७&#xA;१. पंचसिद्धान्तिका २. बृहत्संहिता ३. बृहज्जातक ४. योगयात्रा ५. लघुजातक&#xA;३७८&#xA;ज्योतिष-खण्ड कदम्ब-ध्रुव स्थान से स्थूल मान से २४० अंश की दूरी पर ध्रुव के चतुर्दिक भ्रमण करने वाला वृत्त कदम्ब वृत्त कहलाता है। __ क्रान्ति वृत्त-कदम्ब स्थान से ६०° अंश की दूरी पर क्रान्ति वृत्त होता है। यह कदम्ब के अनुसार २४ अंश तक उत्तर से दक्षिण तक चलता है। इसे राशि वृत्त भी कहते है। यह सूर्च के भ्रमण का पथ भी है।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPILOGUE — The Lost Treasure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;by GIORGIO DE SANTILLANA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . while each art and science has&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;often been developed as far as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;possible, and then again perished,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;these opinions, with others, have&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;been preserved until the present&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;like relics (&lt;em&gt;leipsana&lt;/em&gt;) of the ancient treasure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARISTOTLE, &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bk. Lambda 1074b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AS WE [*]  WERE MOVING towards the conclusion of this essay, some chance or accident or kind intention brought to our eyes, after many years, the work of an author who was our guide when we tried for a first understanding of the early consciousness of man. It was Cassirer&amp;rsquo;s opus on mythical thought. And with all the respect one owes the great historian of Renaissance philosophy, we were astounded. We went through the persuasive and limpid prose, tracing the gradual growth of the concept from wild and uncouth beginnings to the height of Kantian awareness. We gazed again at the stately cortege of great scholars and researchers, Humboldt, Max Muller, Usener and Wissowa, Frazer and Cumont and so many others, the imposing phalanx in which philology, ethnology, history of religion, archaeology, and not least philosophy, display their well-knit progress in good order, to be finally sifted and cleared up by the modern historian of culture. And then, as we reflected further that here was the material that was going to provide advanced survey courses in the immense universities of the future, to build the gleaming machinery of electronic-printed and audiovisual General Humanities for the Masses, we were suddenly overcome with the haunting memory of that unwearied, dedicated, and ridiculous pair, Bouvard and Pécuchet. The merciless irony of Flaubert was surely not called for in the case of Cassirer, but the same genius who created Madame Bovary was suddenly showing us again the shape of certain things to come. A noble enterprise was due to fail, worse, was slated already for the coming &lt;em&gt;Dictionnaire des Idées Reçues&lt;/em&gt;. What Flaubert&amp;rsquo;s pathetic little self-taught characters had in common with the sovereign cultural historian was clear: it was intellectual pride, judging from the height of Progress, which telescopes the countless centuries of the archaic past into artless primitive prattle, to be understood by analogy with the surviving &amp;ldquo;primitives&amp;rdquo; around us. Too much of that primitiveness lies in the eye of the beholder. It took the uncanny penetration of trained observers like Griaule to uncover suddenly the universe of thought which remained hidden to generations of modern Africanists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not yet securely established what the word &lt;em&gt;sippu&lt;/em&gt; means. (See W. Baumgartner, &amp;ldquo;Untersuchungen zu den akkadischen Bauausdrücken,&amp;rdquo; ZA &lt;em&gt;36&lt;/em&gt; [1925], pp. 27, 63; A. Schott, &amp;ldquo;Zu meiner Übersetzung des Gilgamesh-Epos,&amp;rdquo; ZA &lt;em&gt;42&lt;/em&gt; [1934], pp. 105f.) For the style of this battle, characterized by Cyrus Gordon as &amp;ldquo;Beltwrestling&amp;rdquo; JNES &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt;, p. 264), see A. Oppenheim, Or. &lt;em&gt;17&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 29f. &amp;ldquo;They seized each other (by their girdles), like experts they wrestled.! They destroyed the doorpost/ The wall shook&amp;rdquo;. See also E. A. Speiser, &amp;ldquo;Akkadian Myths and Epics,&amp;rdquo; ANET, p. 78. This &amp;ldquo;doorpost&amp;rdquo; is no &lt;em&gt;quantité négligeable&lt;/em&gt; because some similar &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; comes our way again at the &amp;ldquo;entrance&amp;rdquo; of the Cedar Forest, and does the most devilish things to poor Enkidu. (Compare J. Friedrich, &amp;ldquo;Die hethitischen Bruchstücke des Gilgamesh-Epos,&amp;rdquo; ZA &lt;em&gt;39&lt;/em&gt; [1920-30], pp. 48f., dealing with the Hittite fragments; he established at least that it was not the bolt.) In fact, were we to have started from GE, instead of paying it a casual visit, the several &amp;ldquo;doors&amp;rdquo; with their &amp;ldquo;posts,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pillars,&amp;rdquo; with their &amp;ldquo;fillings&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;thresholds&amp;rdquo; would have had as much of a paralyzing effect upon us as the eye of Medusa. Meanwhile, detrimental translations are quite enough to turn the reader to stone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Honneur des Hommes, saint Langage&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discours prophétique et paré . . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VALÉRY, &lt;em&gt;La Pythie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STARTING FROM one theme chosen among many, this self-styled first reconnaissance over uncharted ground has come a long and tortuous way since the early introduction of the Hamlet figure. The discussion has touched immense areas of myth whose probable value was indicated by previous discoveries. The treasures of Celtic tradition, of Egypt, China, tribal or megalithic India, and Oceania have barely been sampled. Nevertheless, the careful, inductive application of critical standards of form along the belt of High Civilizations has been enough to show the remnants of a preliterate &amp;ldquo;code language&amp;rdquo; of unmistakable coherence. No apologies are needed for having followed the argument where it led, but it is very much to be hoped that what has been uncovered will eventually prove sufficiently self-correcting to amend the inevitable errors of this essay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a really undistinguished star. So we cannot be sure if that is what was originally meant or a higher up star like β  Andromedae was used. Narahari Achar holds that the goddess Pathyā Revatī mentioned in the Svastisūkta of the Atri-s implied this asterism. While this is not impossible we are not entirely sure of that especially given the undistinguished nature of the star identified with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The constellation of Pisces while clearly discernable under dark skies is a dim one. This goes against the early H tendency to use bright asterisms to mark nakShatra-s even if they are far from the ecliptic. What were the stars defining revatI? The nakShatra-kalpa of the atharvan tradition holds say ekA revatI: hence, there was only one star in it. siddhAnta astronomy takes that to be zeta Piscium. While close to the ecliptic, at mag 5.2 that is really a faint start to have been the original. 2. We know that the preceding proShThapada literally meant the constellation of the feet of the stool. That makes it unambiguous that square of Pegasus was seen as a stool by the Arya-s, and revatI should be to the west of that. Hence, we suspect that originally revatI was probably beta Andromedae.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2nd deity: &amp;ldquo;The next puzzling issue regarding revatI is the assignment of dual deities with it - puShTipatI pashupA. One of those is transparently named as pUShan. Who is the other one? Most likely it is the goddess pathyA revatI, whom the gopathabrAhmaNa of3 the AV holds to be the wide of the goat-riding pUShan, with the 2 being the guardians of paths, and in this case horses, cows and other domesticates+ food. &amp;hellip; The aitareya brAhmaNa mentions the sun following the path laid our out pathyA (revatI). Given the solar connections of puShan, this coupling is most likely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;</description>

As star-god ilDapinu is the Marduk-star Jupiter, identical with dSUL. PA.E3 . . . , mulUD.AL.TAR . . . Since UD.AL.TAR can also mean the fixed star &lt;em&gt;Procyon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; ilDapinu should have this significance (Jensen, &amp;ldquo;der Furchtbare, Gewaltige (= Humbaba),&amp;rdquo; ZDMG &lt;em&gt;67&lt;/em&gt;, S. 517).&amp;rdquo; (For the identification of Nusku with Mercury, see H. and J. Lewy, &amp;ldquo;The God Nusku,&amp;rdquo; Or. &lt;em&gt;17&lt;/em&gt; [1948], pp. 146-59.) See also Gössmann, 137 s.v. mulUD.AL.TAR: &amp;ldquo;I.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the GE Enkidu appears later on the stage of events than Gilgamesh. This does not entitle us to take him for the prototype of the &amp;ldquo;younger brother&amp;rdquo; (see, e.g., W. Albright, &amp;ldquo;Gilgamesh and Engidu,&amp;rdquo; JAOS &lt;em&gt;40&lt;/em&gt; [1920], pp. 312, 318). Actually, the hairy partner of the Twins, the &amp;ldquo;Dog,&amp;rdquo; is the prototype of the older one who is cheated out of his primogeniture in various ways. Esau, the hairy, is the first born; so is Hono-susori no Mikoto (&lt;em&gt;Nihongi&lt;/em&gt;, trans. by W. G. Aston [repr. 1960], pp. 92-108; K. Florenz, &lt;em&gt;Die historischen Quellen der Shinto-Religion&lt;/em&gt; [1919], pp. 204-21) who, together with his offspring, after having been passed by the Japanese &amp;ldquo;Jacob,&amp;rdquo; had to serve as &amp;ldquo;dogs,&amp;rdquo; as clowns, playactors, guardians of the imperial palace for eighty generations; at New Year and during coronation ceremonies these Hayahito had to bark three times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 29&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We might call it Lethe, and feel happy about it, were it not for the deplorable uncertainty of Lethe&amp;rsquo;s localization, with respect to the celestial itinerary of the soul particularly. The Milky Way being as large as it is, it does not help to state that one has to look for a galactical section. Worse, it remains unclear at which occasion the souls were supposed to drink from the water of this river of forgetfulness, whether they did so shortly after having arrived in Hades or before their re incarnation, or at both times. Although the supposition of an intake of Lethe right at the entrance of Hades would deprive the underworld jurisdiction, together with the good or bad recompenses for former conduct, of its significance, both views were upheld. (See Stoll, in Roscher s.v. Lethe, col. 1957; O. Gruppe, *Griechische Mythologie und *&lt;em&gt;Religionsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; [1906], pp. 403-405, 1036-41. On p. 760, n. 8, Gruppe quotes a passage, according to which a soul which has not yet crossed the river Lethe comes back to molest the living.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous two articles we had discussed about the beginning of year in soni-lunar &lt;em&gt;Uttarayana&lt;/em&gt; i.e. on seasonal &lt;em&gt;Magha Shukla Pratipada,&lt;/em&gt; the units of time and correct way of insertion of intercalary month (&lt;em&gt;Adhikamasa&lt;/em&gt;) according to Vedic tradition. We discussed some of the verses of &lt;em&gt;Vedanga Jyotisha&lt;/em&gt; (abbreviated as VJ in this series) in the context of those discussions. On the occasion of the beginning of Vedic New Year (on December 18) we are discussing about VJ itself, which provides the theoretical foundation of the Vedic calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

[1]  In the Era Epic, Era (=Irragal=Nergal), when announcing a new catastrophe, threatens that he is going to tear out the tarkullu, that he will make the ship drift off, break the steering oar so that the ship cannot land, and remove the mast and all that belongs to it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 34&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, we are up against a completely incomprehensible narrative of events which occurred during a sea voyage. The plant, according to Albright (AJSL &lt;em&gt;36&lt;/em&gt;, p. 281, n. 2) literally &amp;ldquo;thorny grapevine,&amp;rdquo; is supposed to grow in the apsu, and to be accessible by way of a &amp;ldquo;waterpipe.&amp;rdquo; This pipe, &lt;em&gt;rātu&lt;/em&gt;, however, is a conjecture right here: the word occurs only later when, after his bath in a well, and the following loss of the plant, Gilgamesh complains bitterly about his frustration, i.e., about having obtained a boon for the &amp;ldquo;earth lion&amp;rdquo; instead of for himself. The &amp;ldquo;earth lion,&amp;rdquo; identified with the thievish serpent, is assumed in its turn to live &amp;ldquo;in a well which communicated with the apsu&amp;rdquo; (Albright, AJSL &lt;em&gt;35&lt;/em&gt;, p. 194). It is then (GE &lt;em&gt;11&lt;/em&gt;.298) that the hero says: &amp;ldquo;When I opened the water-pipe and (. . .) the gear, I found that which has been placed as a sign for me: I shall withdraw and leave the boat on the shore&amp;rdquo; (Speiser trans., ANET, pp. 96f.). Heidel makes it: &amp;ldquo;When I opened the . . . I have found something that (has been set) for a sign unto me; I will withdraw!&amp;rdquo; Instead of that &amp;ldquo;sign,&amp;rdquo; Albright (RA &lt;em&gt;16&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 17 Sf.) recognized a flood rising out of the &lt;em&gt;pipe&lt;/em&gt; (if so, why does Gilgamesh talk about it only after his bath in the well?): &amp;ldquo;When I opened the water-pipe, I overturned the cover (?). Let not the sea rise to my side, b(efo)re (it) let me retire&amp;rdquo;; and so did Ungnad-Gressmann (pp. 63f.) and Schmoekel (p. 111). From this passage the translators derive the occurrence of the word &lt;em&gt;rātu&lt;/em&gt; in the earlier passage, where Gilgamesh dives for the plant. Speiser alone [1]  refers to another occasion where the word is used, and it is a decisive occasion; namely, in the (wrongly called) &amp;ldquo;Eridu creation story&amp;rdquo; (v. II), where it is told that before anything was created and when all lands were sea (tamtim), then &amp;ldquo;the spring which is in the sea was a water pipe; then Eridu was made, Esagila was built&amp;rdquo; (Heidel, &lt;em&gt;The Babylonian Genesis&lt;/em&gt; [1963], pp. 61f.). Sayce (ERE &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;, p. 129) makes it a &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; within the sea; with Jensen (&lt;em&gt;Assyrisch-Babylonische Mythen und Epen&lt;/em&gt; [1909], p. 41) it is a &amp;ldquo;Wasserbecken&amp;rdquo;; with Ebeling (AOTAT, pp. 130f.) a &amp;ldquo;Schoepfrinne.&amp;rdquo; Considering that Eridu is Canopus, and Esagila is &amp;quot; l-Iku&amp;quot; the Pegasus-square between the two Fishes that ruled the hibernal solstice during the Age of Gemini — this particular &lt;em&gt;rātu&lt;/em&gt; seems to have been the connection between the two depths of the sea, between Pisces as the depth of the salt sea and Canopus as the depth of the apsu, the sweet water ocean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Photius [1]  tells us about Hyllos, son of Herakles, who had a small horn growing out of the left side of his head, and how Epopeus [2]  of Sikyon broke off this horn, after having killed Hyllos in a duel, fetched Styx water with this horn, and became king of the country. Why should he have procured this much dreaded water, if it did not enable him to become king?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 37&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A sidelight falls upon the notions connected with the stag by Hora pollo&amp;rsquo;s statement concerning the Egyptian writing of &amp;ldquo;A long space of time: A Stag&amp;rsquo;s horns grow out each year. A picture of them means a long space of time.&amp;rdquo; [1]  Chairemon (hieroglyph no. 15, quoted by Tzetzes) made it shorter: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;eniautos elaphos&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Louis Keimer, stressing the absence of stags in Egypt, pointed to the Oryx (&lt;em&gt;Capra Nubiana&lt;/em&gt;) as the appropriate &amp;ldquo;ersatz,&amp;rdquo; [2]  whose head was, indeed, used for writing the word &lt;em&gt;rnp&lt;/em&gt; = year, eventually in &amp;ldquo;the Lord of the Year,&amp;rdquo; a well-known title of Ptah. [3]  Rare as this modus of writing the word seems to have been — the &lt;em&gt;Wörterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache&lt;/em&gt; (eds. Erman and Grapow), vol. &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 429-33, does not even mention this variant — it is worth considering (as is every subject dealt with by Keimer), the more so as Chairemon [4]  continues his list by offering as number &lt;em&gt;16&lt;/em&gt;: eniautos phoinix,&amp;quot; i.e., a different span of time, the much-discussed &amp;ldquo;Phoenix-period&amp;rdquo; (ca. 500 years). There are numerous Egyptian words for &amp;ldquo;the year,&amp;rdquo; and the same goes for other ancient languages. Thus, we propose to understand &lt;em&gt;eniautos&lt;/em&gt; as the particular cycle belonging to the respective character under discussion: the mere word &lt;em&gt;eniautos&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;in itself,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;en heauto&lt;/em&gt;; Plato&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Cratylus&lt;/em&gt; 410D) does not say more than just this. It seems unjustifiable to render the word as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; year&amp;rdquo; as is done regularly nowadays, for the simple reason that there is no such thing as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; year; to begin with, there is the tropical year and sidereal year, neither of them being of the same length as the Sothic year. Actually, the methods of Maya, Chinese, and Indian time reckoning should teach us to take much greater care of the words we use. The Indians, for instance, reckoned with five different sorts of “year,&amp;quot; among which one of 378 days, for which A. Weber did not have any explanation. [5]  That number of days, however, represents the synodical revolution of Saturn. Nothing is gained by the violence with which the Ancient Egyptian astronomical system is forced into the presupposed primitive frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Geldner, vague as ever, spells it “der Gewässer Behausung.&amp;quot; Agni, however, is a title, and the &lt;em&gt;Rigveda&lt;/em&gt; stresses time and again that three Agnis already have gone away, &amp;ldquo;consumed&amp;rdquo; by the “sacrificial service.&amp;ldquo;Agni, too, is not only coming from the confluence of the rivers like Gibil, but is also born in the &amp;ldquo;highest sky&amp;rdquo; (RV &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt;.8.2): “Im höchsten Himmel geboren wachte Agni über die (Opfer) regeln als ihr Hüter. Der Klugsinnige mass den Luftraum aus.&amp;rdquo; In fact, he has three birthplaces as a rule, in the &amp;ldquo;three worlds.&amp;rdquo; (We have mentioned already that one of the Agnis had &amp;ldquo;seven mothers,&amp;rdquo; like Heimdal.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Among the many we single out two, without intending to &amp;ldquo;get at the bottom of the matter&amp;rdquo;; the first concerns the &amp;ldquo;ferry-man,&amp;rdquo; the second concerns &amp;ldquo;trees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Face to face with the ferryman Urshanabi, a kind of personified &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; who was dragged away from the &amp;ldquo;confluence of the rivers&amp;rdquo; to check the proper measures of Uruk, it can hardly be taken for a farfetched idea that we ask for comparative &amp;ldquo;individuals&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;places&amp;rdquo; in other Mesopotamian texts. There is, indeed, no need for a frantic search: the Enuma elish offers us an equally decisive item from which depends the whole skeleton map, namely &lt;em&gt;Nibiru&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;nēbēru&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sudarshan, Anand Viswanathan&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Distinguished Professor, and Research Associates,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Centre for Ancient History and Culture, Jain University, Bangalore.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(Received 15 August 2020)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this paper after a brief review of ancient Indian time units, the ingenious method of Indian astronomers for calibrating the small time unit of vighaṭikā (24 seconds) phonetically by the recitation of a Sanskrit verse in the līlākhelā meter with sixty gurvakṣaras, is experimentally verified by sixty independent sample recitations. This is followed by exploring the concept of congruence of akṣara count and time periods such as the month and the year in Vedic texts. This leads to the symbolic equivalence of the bṛhatī meter of 36 syllables to the Year and several other numerical synchronies between phenomenal time and akṣara. The 1000 bṛhatī verses of the prātaranuvāka nocturnal performance in the atirātra ritual is the traceable most ancient origin and inspiration for gauging and estimating lapse of time by recognizing audible syllable as a time measure. To verify this, apart from text based theoretical estimates, real time information from a famous śrauta expert on his prātaranuvāka performance is presented. It is further demonstrated empirically that the rate of 3600 gurvakṣara per ghaṭikā of siddhānta astronomy is closely correlated with the speed of present day traditional chanting of the Ṛgveda, the fidelity of which has remained stable over millennia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We see these developments as internal to the Indo-Iranian world. At least in the Indo-Aryan world the development was largely a consequence of the increasing calenderical emphasis in the shrauta ritual.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vaidika naxatreShTi rituals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was definitely a pre-yavana Indian astrology. It was just of a different nature from the jAtaka and hora astrology of yavana origin. The old astrology is found in the aushanasa adbhutAni and nakShatra parishiShTha-s of Atharvan tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No planets are involved but it works mostly as omenology: e.g. when a planet goes close to rohiNI alpha Tauri they said the following could happen: lakes drying, rivers changing course, suffering to animals including humans, the saMrAT dying.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In a more cryptic account a disease, lasting 20 nights said to arise during planetary conjunctions.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A planet going close to the kR^ittikAH (Pleiades) is said bring death to goats, sheep and rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This also corresponds to shrAvaNI pUrNimA being around summer solstice (~ the time of Apastamba gRhya sUtra-s, see &lt;a href=&#34;../../naxatram/chAndra-naxatram/04_ayanAMshachayanam/&#34;&gt;ayanAMshachayanam&lt;/a&gt; page).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have a text of the nagna nAstika-s, termed sUrya-praj~nApti, where the same system of calenderics as the VJ is expounded. But the jaina-s correct the winter solstice to shravaNa, suggesting that they were after the VJ in the period when you would actually expect the jaina-s to be around. Thus, we have a continuous system of precessional corrections even in the period around the VJ, leave alone the vedic antiquity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;तततरयरणयक&#34;&gt;तैत्तिरीयारण्यके&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vernal equinox was likely &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; actual ashvinI during taittirIya-AraNyaka period &amp;ldquo;नक्षत्राणि रूपम्, अश्विनौ व्यात्तम्&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/&#34;&gt;MT1&lt;/a&gt;, आरण्यके &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/stream/taittiriya/taittiriya_aranyaka_bhaskara_01#page/n309/mode/2up&#34;&gt;ऽत्र&lt;/a&gt;)। विस्तारो ऽन्यत्र।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/jyotiSham/jyotiSham/astrophysics/history/images/zodiac_history/bce-1100-01-14_bharaNI_vishAkhA_equinox_dhaniShThA-6deg_Ashlesha_solstice.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/jyotiSham/jyotiSham/astrophysics/history/images/zodiac_history/bce-1100-01-14_bharaNI_vishAkhA_equinox_dhaniShThA-6deg_Ashlesha_solstice.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;{ }&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is important because in the maitrAyaNi brAhmaNa, shAkhAyanya tells king bR^ihadratha that the winter solistice was in the middle of shraviShThA (MBU 6.14). Thus, the lagadha was clearly aware of the change from the epoch time little before his times. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the character flaws of the later day H was the loss of interest in comets. Early H astronomers in contrast had considerable interest in comets. nArada had a weird theory that all comets were the same one reappearing again &amp;amp; again. Not sure if this was some vague knowledge of Halley&amp;rsquo;s comet or just a strange theory. This comet does seem to have a greenish hue; hence, the old H would have called it an agni-putra-ketu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a long discussion about the following brAhmaNa of the taittirIyakas- तैत्तिरीयब्राह्मणे &lt;a href=&#34;../../kalpe_svamatam/brAhmaNam/taittirIyam/kriyA/puNya-naxatra/&#34;&gt;ऽत्र&lt;/a&gt;।.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The classical commentators (as well as modern shrauta and smArta ritualists familiar with ancient and modern astronomy I checked with) clearly require measurement of the time required by the sun to &amp;ldquo;reach&amp;rdquo; a certain point &amp;ldquo;behind&amp;rdquo; the position of a desired naxatra at sunrise. Of course, this means reaching a certain point on the sun’s daily path, [let’s say that it lies in something called the Diurnal circle (defined below)], which is comparable (say in altitude or proximity) to the point where the nakShatra was last seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that eclipses lunar &amp;amp; solar have been central to a lot of key science from the days of the ancients to until recently. The first estimates of the ratio of the moon-earth diameters by the H &amp;amp; yavana-s came from this. Both reached conclusion of the spherical earth &amp;amp; heavenly bodies from this. Planetary theory arose from eclipse observations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closer to our times space-time distortion by gravity (general relativity) was tested by this. Highly ionized Fe which was thought to be a new element was also discovered from eclipse observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

N. Iyengar · Sunder Chakravarty Received: 26 June 2023 / Accepted: 22 September 2023 (RN.Iyengar AAA jainuniversity.ac.in)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Centre for Ancient History and Culture, Jain University, Bangalore 560078, India&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;© Indian National Science Academy 2023&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;0&#34;&gt;0&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first theoretical system of tracking sun in the tropical annual cycle is cryptically mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇīya Āraṇyaka Upaniṣat (MAU) of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, as the southern sojourn of sun starting at the summer solstice. This is called maghādyaṁ, the first point of the maghā nakṣatra, identified most likely with the early morning visibility of ε-Leo, near the azimuth of the sunrise point on the horizon as observed at Kurukshetra. Twenty seven equal nakṣatra sectors named in the traditional sequential order cover one tropical circuit of sun of 366 days with the winter solstice falling exactly at the middle of the śraviṣṭhā sector. Even though MAU mentions each nakṣatra to be made up of four quarters, no practical application of this ¼-nakṣatra sky part amounting to 3º20´ in longitude is seen in Vedic texts till we come to the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, a text closer to the Vedas. This Purāṇa states, observed equinoctial full moon positions corresponding to spring equinox at ¼-kṛttikā and autumn equinox at ¾-viśākha exactly 180º apart as they should be. This statement is analysed in this paper by computer simulation of full moon time series for the years − 2400 to − 800 to show that the Purāṇa data would be realistically valid for the period 1980 BCE to 1610 BCE. It is further demonstrated that the Purāṇa has followed the maghādi system of solar nakṣatra system stated in the MAU. The central epoch circa 1800 BCE of this maghādi equal nakṣatra solar zodiac got modified, due to precession effects, to the śraviṣṭhādi scheme of Parāśara, Vṛddha Garga and Lagadha dateable to circa 1300 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(munayo vāta raśanāḥ).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Via S kAk: ŚB 4.1.5.16 describes the sun as puṣkaramādityo, “the lotus of the sky”. ŚB 8.7.3.10 says :  tudasāvāditya imūmlokūnt sūtre samāvayate, tad yat tat sūtram vāyuh &amp;hellip;. The sun strings these worlds (the earth, the planets, the atmosphere] to himself on a thread.

The planets, attached to these points by cords of air, are drawn away by them, with the right and left hand, forward or backward, according to nearness, toward their own place. A wind, called pravaha, impels them toward their own ucсas, being drawn away forward and backward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Like other planets, angular speed of earth around sun is uneven - slower at aphelion, faster at perihelion. If solstice positions occur between aphelion and perihelion, one half will be shorter than another. The maximum gap between half years (eg solstice to solstice) is 187:178 (as in -3980BCE).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Solstice positions relative to aphelion and perihelion keeps shifting due to Apsidal precession. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT_bsnxAJV4r18m6LP6rx8_JY7szc13CYB5Z-_9r39akNtERroUcfpI-kTSAbtLKrCQ3ePi3aaj1ILc/pubhtml&#34;&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;thumbnail&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;../../images/Precessing_Kepler_orbit.gif&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/Precessing_Kepler_orbit.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;        Apsidal precession&#xA;        &#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;records&#34;&gt;Records&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shatapatha brAhmaNa altar construction seems to approximately represent this with the 14:15 brick layout. See S kAk &lt;a href=&#34;../../history/solar_orbit_brAhmaNas_subhASh_kAk/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;while 18/19 is a superior approximation, 14/15 is still a decent approximation of  179/186 with a few &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; bricks. Assuming a looser approximation/ representation seemd more &amp;ldquo;charitable&amp;rdquo; for our ancestors than assuming that they imprecisely measured half-yr.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This  might have been reflected in Angkor Wat construction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the uncited quotes and translations are by the mAnasatarangiNIkAra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aitreya-brāhmaṇa-27-1kbce-or-older&#34;&gt;Aitreya Brāhmaṇa 2.7 1kBCE or older&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The (sun) never really sets or rises. In that they think of him “He is setting&amp;rdquo;, having reached the end of the day, he inverts himself; thus he makes evening below, day above. Again in that they think of him “He is rising in the morning”, having reached the end of the night he inverts himself; thus he makes day below, night above. He never sets; indeed he never sets.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Subhash kAk on this passage: &amp;ldquo;One way to visualize it is to see the universe as the hollow of a sphere so that the inversion of the sun now shines the light on the world above ours. But this is impossible since the sun does move across the sky during the day and if the sun doesn&amp;rsquo;t set or rise it doesn&amp;rsquo;t move either. Clearly, the idea of “inversion&amp;rdquo; denotes nothing but a movement of the earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;shatapatha-brahmana-1k-bce&#34;&gt;shatapatha-brAhmaNa 1k BCE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ŚB 4.1.5.16 describes the sun as puṣkaramādityo, “the lotus of the sky”. ŚB 8.7.3.10 says :  - tudasāvāditya imāmlokānt sūtre samāvayate, tad yat tat sūtram vāyuh &amp;hellip;.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The sun strings these worlds (the earth, the planets, the atmosphere] to himself on a thread. This thread is the same as the wind &amp;hellip;..&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This suggests a &lt;strong&gt;central role to the sun&lt;/strong&gt; in defining the motions of the planets and ideas such as these must have ultimately led to the theory of the śīghrocca and the mandocca cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;suryasiddhanta&#34;&gt;sUryasiddhAnta&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Earth is said to be a stationary globe around which sun, moon and five planets orbit, with sun (via śīghrocca position) playing a major role in propelling the outer planets.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It calculates the earth&amp;rsquo;s diameter to be 8,000 miles (modern: 7,928 miles), diameter of moon as 2,400 miles (actual ~2,160) and the distance between moon and earth to be 258,000 miles (actual ~238,000).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thus everywhere on [the surface of] the terrestrial globe, people suppose their own place higher [than that of others], yet this globe is in space where there is no above nor below.&amp;rdquo; —Surya Siddhanta, XII.53&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Via S kAk: Surya Siddhānta (SS) seems to remember this pre-epicyclic astronomy of the earlier period. The uccas and the node (pāta) are thus described in SS 2.1-5: &amp;ldquo;Forms of time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodaic, called the sīghrocca, mandocca, and node (pāta), are causes of the motion of the planets. The planets, attached to these points by cords of air, are drawn away by them, with the right and left hand, forward or backward, according to nearness, toward their own place. A wind, called pravaha, impels them toward their own ucсas, being drawn away forward and backward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aryabhata-500-ad&#34;&gt;Aryabhata 500 AD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aryabhata (born in 476 AD. ) appears to have held the view that the &lt;strong&gt;stars did not revolve round the earth, but the latter revolved round itself&lt;/strong&gt; and gave the illustration of a man sitting in a moving boat feeling that it is the stationary objects on the banks that rush past in the opposite direction. &amp;hellip; This was more than eleven hundred years before Galileo and there is nothing to show that Aryabhata suffered in the least for his views.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some neo-(hindu)-traditionalists decry celebration of new year on Jan 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the sentiment that new year celebration should be tied to awareness of change in nature. However, it should be noted that in Vedic times, phAlgunI (roughly the same time of the year, accounting for equinoctial precession) was considered to be new year beginning. This coincides quite closely with winter solstice (uttarAyaNArambha), which is a major event in itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jupter-saturn-conjunction&#34;&gt;Jupter Saturn conjunction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great conjunction is a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn (Κρόνος: Kronos). Kronos gives the measure of time to Jupiter. A Triple Conjunction is a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn at or near their opposition to the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;periods&#34;&gt;Periods&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every twenty years (19.859), Saturn and Jupiter will have a conjunction at about 123 degrees apart (approximately ninth from the previous conjunction).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every 60 years (59.577) that conjunction will return to the same sign.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a conjunction happened in Aries, in twenty years, the next will happen in Sagittarius, then Leo in twenty more years, and then back to Aries after 60 years from the original Aries conjunction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In this way, the conjunctions will move in the same rAshi trines creating a triangle in the zodiac. &amp;hellip; The cycle will stay in one rAshi trine for about 200 years, then it will enter the next rAshi triad. &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cycle will move through all the zodiac signs every 800 years (794.37 years or 40 conjunctions) returning to within .93° of the starting point if one uses a tropical calculation. (A given vertex will take ~800 years to reach the sign occupied by the next vertex, they being 4 rAshis apart.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;thumbnail&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;../images/great_conjunction_triangles_1941.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;../images/great_conjunction_triangles_1941.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;        Great conjunction triangles&#xA;        &#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;connection-to-yugas&#34;&gt;Connection to yugas&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This 1° discrepancy creates a larger cycle in which the exact degree returns in 288,000 years (800 X 360). In Satya Yuga there are 6 of these cycles, in Tretā Yuga there are 4.5, in Dvāpara there are 3, and in Kali Yuga there are 1.5 which gives a total of 15 of the grand 288,000 year cycles in a Mahāyuga.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One puzzle is whether the Mongols put together their nakShatra list from Uighur list or independently from the sUryagarbhasUtra, which the tAthAgata-s in their characteristic plagiaristic way claimed was taught by the sugata. e.g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kR^ittikA -&amp;gt; Uig: Kirdik; Mon: Kerteg&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;but rohiNI-&amp;gt; Uig: urughuNi; Mon: rokini;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vishAkhA -&amp;gt; Uig: vishak; Mon shushagh. The Mongol transformation for vishAkhA is odd.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Others are quite similar &amp;amp; regularly derived from the H list. Notably, 1 the Indian transmission to the chIna-s begins with chitrA but Uighur &amp;amp; Mongol list begin with kR^ittikA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With effect from 14 April 2004 or from 25 Chaitra 1926 Saka Era of the National Calendar, Govt. of India introduced a uniform All-India Nirayana Solar Calendar corresponding to 1 Vaisakha, 5105 Kali Era, Kali Era being chosen as the era for this calendar. This Nirayana Calendar has fixed number of days for its month and consequently has leap years at required intervals. The intention for introducing this calendar has been that it would progressively replace the divergent regional Nirayana Solar Calendars and bring about uniformity in our traditional calendric system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How many of us know of Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājī?(1444-1545). One of the greatest mathematician-astronomers of the middle ages. He provided a geoheliocentric planetary model in which planets revolved around the sun. His calculations stayed the most accurate in the world until Kepler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somayājī (1444-1545) was a Namboodiri Brāhmaṇa of the Gargeya lineage (Ashvalayana Rigvedi) who provided a geoheliocentric model of planetary motion nearly century before Copernicus&amp;rsquo;s pure heliocentric model. His calculations on planetary orbit around the sun were revolutionary. Somayājī&amp;rsquo;s work completely challenged the dominant geocentric model of planetary motion. 200 years after his magnum opus; a Danish astronomer by name of Tycho Brahe would propose the same geoheliocentric system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PARAŚARA’S SIX SEASON SOLAR ZODIAC AND HELIACAL VISIBILITY OF STAR AGASTYA IN 1350-1130 BC&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;R N IYENGAR&lt;br&gt;&#xA;+++(with comments by vishvAsa in this font.)+++&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bright southern star Canopus is known as Agastya in India. The first rise of this star is observed with religious fervour in many parts of the country. Legends say that the Vedic sage Agastya crossed the Vindhya Mountains to go south and eventually remained as the southern star known by his name. This star would not have been clearly visible before 3100 BC in the northern parts of India. The star exhibits all the four visibility phenomena namely, heliacal rise, cosmic setting, acronychal rise and heliacal setting. Hence statements about its heliacal visibility and setting in the Parāśaratantra as quoted by Varāhamihira and his commentator are of seminal importance as anchor points of early Hindu astronomy and ancient Indian chronology. This paper analyses the visibility information given by Parāśara in relation to his six season solar zodiac preserved in Utpala’s commentary. It is demonstrated that the observations were realistic for 1350-1130 BC, which is also the estimated date of the ancient Indian astronomer Parāśara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The names for the days of the week which have been adopted throughout western Europe are based on the names of the seven known &amp;lsquo;planets&amp;rsquo;, arranged in their supposed order of decreasing distance from the Earth &amp;ndash; Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon &amp;ndash; and are of astrological origin. &amp;hellip; The planet to which the first hour of the day was consecrated was regarded as the regent of that day&amp;hellip;. In the Teutonic languages, the names of their divinities Tiu, Woden, Thor, and Freya are used instead of their Roman counterparts, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus.&amp;rdquo; {{A History of Technology, volume 3, p. 565f}}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hindus celebrate the sathabhishekam in their 81st year, but they are mathematically challenged. Since you basically witness 12 moon orbits a year, 80 clocks up only 960 moon orbits. As per the traditional calendar, there is an adhika-maasa (also called mala-maasa, or intercalary month) about every 2.5 years. So in 80 years, there would be about 32 adhika-maasas. The remaining 8 new moons are seen in the 81st year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can actually count 1,000 new moons. Let me state it differently: The synodic period of the moon is about 29.5 days. So, it takes about 80.82 years for 1,000 synodic lunar months to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not one of them could correctly point even a few out n the sky- that was the general knowledge of the Hindu astrologer. However in contrast he found a shrauta ritualist from near Kolaba who was able to correctly point out all of them in the sky. He further cited an incantation from tradition that went at below: This contains the code to determine the rising point of the ecliptic from the nakShatra at meridian: e.g. if ashvayuji is at meridian i.e. at midnight then rising point of  ecliptic is 102 degrees on the ecliptic so on for each n&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These are nirayana sankramanas. Likewise 12 sankramanas occur based on the Sun’s northward and southward movements. These are sayana sankramanas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At one time, both kinds of sankramanas happened together. However, over time, sayana sankramanas have started to occur earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Kak*&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Department of Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803-5901, USA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(Received 30 June 1997; after revision 12 January 1998)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We show that the Brāhmaṇas recognize that the speed of the sun varies with the seasons. The year-long rites of the Brāhmaṇas were organized with the summer solstice (viṣuvant) as the middle point. These rites counted the days upto the solstice and in the latter half of the year, and there is an asymmetry in the two counts. This is an astronomical parameter, which had hitherto escaped notice, that allows us to date the rites to a period much earlier than has been assumed. A fire altar described in the śatapatha Brāhmaṇa represents the motion of the sun and this motion is asymmetric with respect to the earth. The concept of a force field associated with the sun, likened to the wind in the śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, appears to be the basic idea which led to the notions of the mandocca and śīghrocca cycles which are fundamental to the later Siddhāntic astronomy. Key Words: Ancient astronomy, Mandocca, śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, śīghrocca, The sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The temple architecture and the city plan are, therefore, related in their conception. Volwahsen (2001) has remarked on the continuity in the Indian architectural tradition. The Harappan cities have a grid plan, just as is recommended in the Vedic manuals. The square shape represents the heavens, with the four directions representing the cardinal directions as well as the two solstices and the equinoxes of the sun’s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His primary area of academic interest is the ‘History of Mysore under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Persian manuscript in the British Library in London and other documents help correct an error in Tipu Sultan’s birthdate. The ensuing research also offers a fresh insight into the mind of the Mysore ruler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Henderson who documented Tipu Sultan’s coinage across his realm was confronted with the problem of identifying the exact Mauludi dates on the coins and relating them to the Hijri and Christian Eras so as to ascertain periods of existence of the royal mints vis-a-vis Tipu’s possession of the territories that these mints were in. He requested the Hon’ble Diwan Bahadur L.D. Swamikannu Pillai, M.A., L.L.B., author of Indian Chronology (Madras, 1911) and a well known authority on the subject to examine these dates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(The below includes extracts from: wikipedia.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trepidation (from Lat. trepidus, &amp;ldquo;trepidatious&amp;rdquo;), in now-obsolete medieval theories of astronomy, refers to hypothetical oscillation in the precession of the equinoxes. The theory was popular from the 9th to the 16th centuries. Trepidation was the mainstay of Hindu astronomy and was used to compute ayanamsha for converting sidereal to tropical longitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-suryasiddhanta&#34;&gt;In Suryasiddhanta&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third chapter of the Suryasiddhanta, verses 9-10, provides the method for computing it, which E. Burgess interprets as 27 degree trepidation in either direction over a full period of 7200 years, at an annual rate of 54 seconds. This is nearly the same as the Arab period of about 7000 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It goes against the vedAnga-jyotiSha itself, which says about purely solar uttarAyaNa: &amp;ldquo;घर्मवृद्धिरपां प्रस्थः क्षपाह्रास उदग्गतौ । दक्षिणेतौ विपर्यासः षण्मुहूर्त्ययनेन तु ।।&amp;rdquo; Further, while I agree that that the start of the new year as well as the luni-solar uttarAyaNa as per vedAnga jyotiSha and purANa-s is with mAgha, the current popular reckoning of adhika-mAsa-s is awry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This conflation finds some justification (ie relying on the &amp;ldquo;mean uttarAyaNa point&amp;rdquo;) if one relies on the now defunct theory of Trepidation from sUrya-siddhAnta.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Difference between siderial and tropical year lengths is the reason for the drift between makara sankramaNa and uttarAyaNArambha. 3.9003e-5&lt;em&gt;1600&lt;/em&gt;365 = ~ 22 days. &amp;ldquo;प्रायेण १५०० अब्दपूर्वं मकरराशौ उत्तरायणं भवति स्मेति गतानुगतिकतया अधुना इत्थं प्रचलति। वैदिकवत्सरारम्भोऽपि वास्तविकेन उत्तरायणेनैव सह सम्बद्धः, प्रायेण तत्पूर्वस्थायां शुक्लप्रतिपदायां भवतीति मया विस्तरेणोपस्थापितमेव।&amp;rdquo; - सम्मोदार्यः।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In 272 BC, Makara Sankramana was on Dec 21. In 1000 AD, Makara Sankramana was on Dec 31 and now it falls on January 14. After 9000 years, it will be in June. As a result, it will indicate the start of Dakshinayanam, if corrections are not incorporated as per drik calculations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;corrections&#34;&gt;Corrections&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kAnchI maTha, with it&amp;rsquo;s naxatra-darsha shrIramaNa-sharmA, has shifted to celebrating solstices on the correct date since 2010s.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Wonderful are the methods of exposition of the author of this commentary who justifies his enunciations by exhaustive discussions, mentioning the manifold methods of ancient Ācāryas in the process of making astronomical calculations. It is a matter for immense gratification for Keraliyas that this commentary makes it palpably evident that the great Hindu Ācāryas of the East like those of the West had recourse to independent mechanical contrivances for the purposes of accurate planet- ary observations and calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No existing interpretations except those of Madhusūdan Ojha (of which most scholars are unaware) will convince him simply because they have never gone deep into the basic concepts which the Aryans had on Nature and her working, which alone will enable one to build up a logical picture of their culture, rituals, concepts, habits and beliefs. Actually the interpreters broadly fall into two main categories. The first one constitutes those who refuse to question the authority of the Vedas and take for granted whatever is said in them and the supporting literature like Brāhmaṇas, Upaniṣads etc. The second type could not accept the above position and at the same time could not discover the logic in many of the statements found in the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas. They therefore came to the conclusion that many of these statements are myths or stories and have no logical or factual basis Some of the scholars belonging to the first type have tried to find some reasoning in many Vedic statements but they have in our opinion miserably failed to find convincing explanation to many of the statements simply because they could not master the entire literature and connect up the passages properly in a coherent way The physical phenomena on the earth or in the atmosphere or the astronomical phenomena in the heavens described in their own way by the Maharṣis and couched in symbolic language could not be resolved by them. The technical words occuring in large numbers in the Vedic and Brāhmaṇic passages have posed the greatest challenge to the interpreters and it is here that no two interpretations agreed, The result has been that many passages were interpreted differently by different scholars. The Vedic Gods, for example as conceived by the Vedic seers are essentially forces of Nature taking part in the creation and maintenance of the universe But the symbolic language used by them as well as the glorification of these forces have misled many interpreters who could not understand their nature correctly. The authors of the six systems of philosophy based their theories on the authority of the Vedas but their conclusions differed from each other, thereby implying that the message of the Vedas can take divergent directions. Sankara, Ramānuja and Madhvācārya interpreted the Vedas Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads in their own way and arrived at divergent conclusions. This manoeuverability in the interpretations in course of time led to some serious consequences. For example &lt;em&gt;Rudra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Viṣṇu&lt;/em&gt; which represent physical forces having complimentary functions in the creative process became gods of differing importance &lt;em&gt;Rudra&lt;/em&gt; (Indra) represents Agni and &lt;em&gt;Visņu&lt;/em&gt; represents the force that constantly feeds Agni with food (Soma) and promotes the creative process (Yajña). It is unfortunate that incorrect interpretation of these have led to the division of a single society into various factions which certainly was&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Part II containing the Sanskrit text with Pṛthudaka&amp;rsquo;s commentary is now published. It has not been possible to reconstruct the Uttara-Khaṇḍanakhādyaka or the supplementary part of the work in which Brahmagupta gave his own corrections to Āryabhaṭa&amp;rsquo;s astronomical constants, new methods and additional topics, to make the Khaṇḍanakhādyaka itself a complete manual of Hindu Astronomy. In view of this I have thought it proper to include in this publication all the additional verses that are found in the text as used by Bhaṭṭotpalain his commentary on it. These verses are generally of an explanatory character, and do not all appear to be of Brahmagupta&amp;rsquo;s composition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine that someone (e.g., a Mīmāṃsā opponent) would have just made it up, because no one replies accordingly. They rather accept that it is Vedic and try to explain away the seeming lack of meaning…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If Śambhureferred to in the word Śāmbhava in the Rasaratnākara was the same as Siddha Śrīkaṇṭha Śambhu, then Nidhipradīpa may be taken as the source from which Rasaratnākara quoted the above verses. This work dealing as it does with various means of finding out hidden treasures may be considered as a valuable addition to the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. The poet says that &amp;rsquo;the earth is vast and time is unlimited&amp;rsquo; and it is not certain that an &lt;em&gt;Adhikāri&lt;/em&gt; of this work may not turn up. I have therefore thought it advisable to preserve the work by publishing it in this Sanskrit Series, in accordance with the practice of protecting the work dealing with Dīrghasatra,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This messes up vyApti decisions (besides making the logic complicated), besides giving ridiculous times for regions with very long/short  day lengths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;पृथिव्या दृष्ट्या शीघ्रक्रमेण ग्रहाः - चन्द्रः, बुधः, शुक्रः, सूर्यः, मङ्गलः, गुरुः, शनैश्चरः।&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;एषु चतुर्थं चतुर्थं गृहीत्वा लभ्यन्ते वासरनामानि- सूर्यः, चन्द्रः, मङ्गलः, बुधः, गुरुः, शुक्रः, शनैश्चरः ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;परमणम&#34;&gt;प्रमाणम्&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;आर्यभटीये -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;सप्त +एते होरेशाः शनैश्-चराद्याः यथाक्रमं शीघ्राः ।&#xA;शीघ्र-क्रमात् चतुर्थाः भवन्ति सूर्योदयाद् दिन-पाः ॥ १६ ॥&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;सूर्यसिद्धान्ते -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;मन्दादधःक्रमेण स्युश्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;चतुर्था दिवसाधिपाः।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;वर्षाधिपतयस् तद्-वत्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तृतीयाश् च प्रकीर्तिताः॥७८॥&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;मलम&#34;&gt;मूलम्&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the rationale for the next weekday in the sequence to be the 4th in the order of decreasing speed? It is because the grahas are assigned in that same order (Chaldean order of planets) to 24 planetary hours (starting from dawn). The ruler of the planetary hour at dawn gives its name to the weekday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;{&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/06/the-snake-of-vishnu/&#34;&gt;MT04&lt;/a&gt;} - &amp;ldquo;ViShNu is a predominantly precessional deity. All his five early incarnations contain the precessional motifs that were uncovered by Santillana and von Dechend in The Hamlet’s Mill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;{&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/22/dandins-purvapithika-of-dasha-kumara-charitra/&#34;&gt;MT06&lt;/a&gt;} - &amp;ldquo;It is in this context that the great R^ikSha jAmbavant is described as circumambulating trivikrama as he took his great strides. This represents the new axis being established and the constellation of the Great Bear (represented as the bear jAmbavant) making a circle of the north celestial pole. Indeed viShNu himself is identified with the constellation of the shishumAra or Draco associated with the old north pole from earlier period of Aryan memory.  As the knowledge of precession is very subtle (even alluded in the opening of the maitrayaNi brAhmaNa fragment (&amp;ldquo;अथ किमेतैर्वान्यानां शोषणं महार्णवानां शिखरिणां प्रपतनं ध्रुवस्य प्रचलनं स्थानं वा तरूणां निमज्जनं पृथिव्याः स्थानादपसरणं सुराणं&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/maitri.html?lang=sa&#34;&gt;MU&lt;/a&gt;) by shAkAyanya who was well aware of these matters) the third step of viShNu is secret and was only know to the great kavi-s.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;In Indian architecture its depicted more directly on many occasions, but more subtly in the great iron pillar of the guptas. Before the iron pillar was uprooted by the Mohammedans and placed in the vicinity of their giant phallic signpost at Delhi, it graced the now derilict Hindu astronomical observatory at the viShNupAda-giri in the udayagiri complex. The iron pillar (as shown by Balasubramanian) was graced by a nakShatra-chakra on the top and was known as the viShNu dhvaja– depicting the great axis in front of the observatory located atop the hill. Thus, in the immortal pillar did chandragupta II vikramAditya, one of the greatest rulers of bhArata commemorate the step of viShNu and and world axis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
