## Prehistory
> The veda also furnishes direct accounts of the deadly jaw-like nature of the halves of the years ...Thus, the crashing doors are the halves of the year held by the frame of solstices and equinoxes. ...  the deadly crashing doors are an ancient mythic motif representing the year and might be used in the precession myths. ... A corollary would be that these mythic motifs had come into being at least by 12000 year BP when the Native Americans are believed to have separated from the Eurasians. If so the long records of precession ‘literally” yuga after yuga” might not be surprising.

## Record of shifting equinox points
- See [tropicalization section of ayanAMsha](../equinoctial_records/) notes
- तैत्तिरीय-ब्राह्मणारण्यकयोर् नक्षत्रमुखभेदेन तज्ज्ञानं व्यक्तम्। 
- "assertion of the American indologist Whitney maintained to this date among Abrahamistic white indologists and their imitators: "The Hindus borrowed their nakShatra system from Mesopotamia and would probably have retained it in that form \[i.e. with kR^ittikA at the vernal equinox of 2300 BCE\] until the present day but for the revolution wrought in their science by Greek teaching." Clearly even within the vaidika period (including vedA~Nga jyotiSha) the Hindus had made multiple changes for precession not just at the time of varAhamihira after interactions with yavana-s." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/)\]

## Record of pole stars
- references - [RNI2021-YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWGBnE9PtsE)

> 3000 BCE when a-Draconis was the star Abhaya-Dhruva stationary at the tail end of the animal figure looking like a whale called Siśumāra recognizable as the modern constellation Draco. (taittirIya Aranyaka refers to this.)
> 
> Due to the effect of precession this sky picture changed with references to the circling and drifting of Dhruva appearing in ancient Vedic tradition around 1600 BC.
> 
> Then came a period when there was no fixed star at the Pole but still Dhruva was shown to the bride in the marriage rites, reciting the ancient hymns addressing the star Dhruva. People continued to believe in their ancient Vedic Dhruva through Puranic stories as noted and ridiculed by Alberuni in 11th Century.
> 
> Scientific astronomers, Brahmagupta (7th Cent), Bhaskara (12th Cent), Padmanabha (15th Cent) recognized a group of stars near the North Pole and named this group Dhruva-matsya (Polar-fish) and placed the new approaching Pole Star (a-U.Minor) at the mouth of this Fish.
> 
> In contrast, the orthodox tradition upheld by the Vedānta schools (gth - 14th Cent) described Dhruva as a star at the tail of the celestial Siśumāra of the Yajurvedic Taittirīya Aranyaka only. Iconographic worship of Vişnu as an aquatic four legged animal Siśumāra with Dhruva shown on the uplifted tail continues to this day in some temples. 
> 
> Kamalākara a famous astronomer of Vārāṇasi, in the 17th century argued that whether or not Dhruva moves, the current Pole Star that looks fixed should be shown in Hindu marriages.

### विष्णु+अवतार-कथा-सम्बन्धः -
- {[MT04](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/06/the-snake-of-vishnu/)} - "ViShNu is a predominantly precessional deity. All his five early incarnations contain the precessional motifs that were uncovered by Santillana and von Dechend in The Hamlet’s Mill."
- {[MT06](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/22/dandins-purvapithika-of-dasha-kumara-charitra/)} - "It is in this context that the great R^ikSha jAmbavant is described as circumambulating trivikrama as he took his great strides. This represents the new axis being established and the constellation of the Great Bear (represented as the bear jAmbavant) making a circle of the north celestial pole. Indeed viShNu himself is identified with the constellation of the shishumAra or Draco associated with the old north pole from earlier period of Aryan memory.  As the knowledge of precession is very subtle (even alluded in the opening of the maitrayaNi brAhmaNa fragment ("अथ किमेतैर्वान्यानां शोषणं महार्णवानां शिखरिणां प्रपतनं ध्रुवस्य प्रचलनं स्थानं वा तरूणां निमज्जनं पृथिव्याः स्थानादपसरणं सुराणं" [MU](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/maitri.html?lang=sa)) by shAkAyanya who was well aware of these matters) the third step of viShNu is secret and was only know to the great kavi-s." ... "In Indian architecture its depicted more directly on many occasions, but more subtly in the great iron pillar of the guptas. Before the iron pillar was uprooted by the Mohammedans and placed in the vicinity of their giant phallic signpost at Delhi, it graced the now derilict Hindu astronomical observatory at the viShNupAda-giri in the udayagiri complex. The iron pillar (as shown by Balasubramanian) was graced by a nakShatra-chakra on the top and was known as the viShNu dhvaja– depicting the great axis in front of the observatory located atop the hill. Thus, in the immortal pillar did chandragupta II vikramAditya, one of the greatest rulers of bhArata commemorate the step of viShNu and and world axis."

## Early ayanAMsha offset records
- The mAgha-solstice epoch was very influential in later literature. We see then evidence of offsetting nakshatras to match tropical months.
- Amara i. 4.13: द्वौ द्वौ माघादिमासौ स्याद् ऋतुस् तैर् अयनं त्रिभिः। 
-  Mah. Apu. 167, 26 and 28: 
  परिवृत्तो हि भगवान् सहस्रांशुर् दिवाकरः ॥२६॥  
  … माघोऽयं समनुप्राप्तो मासः सौम्यो युधिष्ठिर॥
  त्रिभागशेषः पक्षोऽयं शुक्लो भवितुम् अर्हति ॥२८॥ 



## Trepidation
(The below includes extracts from: wikipedia.)

Trepidation (from Lat. trepidus, "trepidatious"), in now-obsolete medieval theories of astronomy, refers to hypothetical oscillation in the precession of the equinoxes. The theory was popular from the 9th to the 16th centuries. Trepidation was the mainstay of Hindu astronomy and was used to compute ayanamsha for converting sidereal to tropical longitudes.

### In Suryasiddhanta
The third chapter of the Suryasiddhanta, verses 9-10, provides the method for computing it, which E. Burgess interprets as 27 degree trepidation in either direction over a full period of 7200 years, at an annual rate of 54 seconds. This is nearly the same as the Arab period of about 7000 years. Brahma Siddhanta, Soma Siddhanta and Narada Purana describe exactly the same theory and magnitude of trepidation as in Suryasiddhanta, and some other Puranas also provide concise references to precession, esp Vayu purana and Matsya Purana.
- The zero date according to the Suryasiddhanta was 499 AD, after which trepidation is forward in the same direction as modern equinoctial precession.
- The vernal equinox of the Surya Siddhanta librated 27° in both directions from the sidereal epoch. Thus the equinox moved 54° in one direction and then back 54° in the other direction.  This cycle took 7200 years to complete at a rate of 54″/year. The equinox coincided with the epoch at the beginning of the Kaliyuga in −3101 and again 3600 years later in 499. The direction changed from prograde to retrograde midway between these years at −1301 when it reached its maximum deviation of 27°, and would have remained retrograde, the same direction as modern precession, for 3600 years until 2299.
- For the period before 1301 BCE, Surya-siddhantic trepidation would be opposite in sign to equinoctial precession. For the period 1301 BCE to 2299 AD, equinoctial precession and Suryasiddhantic precession would have the same direction and sign, only differing in magnitude.
