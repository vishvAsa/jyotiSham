I have waited till now to predict the outcome of 2020 election, though I have been very vocal that Trump transitioned in June 2020 from an awesome long-term dasa (life phase) to an awful one. It is because I was not too confident of the accuracy of Joe Biden's birth time (the unreliable time we have suggested that he will win, but after some delay till at least late November). But now I am ready to make a prediction, as I am confident of the birth data of senator Kamala Devi Harris, whom Joe Biden picked as his running mate. ... 
I expect her to be reasonably friendly towards India, but not really a great friend of Hinduism.
